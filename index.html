  You turn on the TV or open Hulu. You go to YouTube or look at magazine covers in line at the grocery store. You scan the day’s headlines. Scroll through Instagram or Twitter for the latest meme. There they are.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  The Kardashians are keeping up with you. </p>
<br>
  <p>
  Since the premier of their E! network reality television series in the fall of 2007, the Kardashians have embedded themselves into an ever-growing web of platforms that currently shape our individual media diets from print journalism to online social networks. In the process, they have emerged in the early twenty-first century as the first family of popular culture, simultaneously the harbingers of our social decline or the champions of third wave feminism (depending on who you ask). The family functions as a litmus test for a variety of controversial issues, including taste, capitalism, pornography, race, ethnicity, cultural appropriation, gender, and sexuality. The Kardashians remain important for their ability to normalize a matriarchal family structure and transform the traditionally private sphere of the home into their center of business, all while maintaining heteronormative assumptions about the objectification of women.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Just how instrumental are the Kardashians in shaping and/or reflecting contemporary cultural desires, anxieties, and consumptive habits? What would it mean to actually keep up with the Kardashians’ ever-expanding, ever-monetizing media empire?</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  The 2016-2017 Praxis Program Cohort at the University of Virginia’s Scholars’ Lab learned and implemented digital humanities methodologies to analyze the interconnected media ecologies sustained by the Kardashians. In the first section, we theorize the meaning of the name of our project and its relationship to the family’s Armenian ethnic heritage. The second section considers the politics of taste, the placement of the Kardashians in the history of celebrity, and the ways Kardashian-themed fan fiction reflects conceptions of family and belonging. The final section discusses the DH methodologies we used in creating a data set of every tweet written by members of the Kardashian family, as well as every relevant US Weekly article, by using web scraping, text analysis, and topic modeling techniques. Furthermore, the Kardashians use of Twitter, Instagram, mobile apps, online blogs, and even tabloid coverage work together to engage fans in an unending advertisement for their show. Whether commenting on news events, promoting awareness of the Armenian genocide, or producing extravagant television specials, the Kardashian family has harnessed the 24/7 media landscape in unprecedented ways. </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  So, what does it take to keep up with the Kardashians? The DASH-Amerikan project demonstrates that only through creative uses of DH methodologies can we begin to keep up and engage with this cultural phenomenon. When we do, we dig past the surface of their heavily curated public image to understand the meaning of the Kardashians to contemporary perceptions of ethnicity, race, taste, and sexuality and the centrality of digital media to their indomitable cultural influence.</p>

<h2>II. Hating the Kardashians and the Politics of Taste</h2>
<p>
“When you look at the scary state of this country, it’s insane how things that began as jokes keep going, like the Kardashians. They weren’t supposed to last this long. And now this Trump thing, where everyone said, ‘Oh, he’ll be out, he’ll be out, he’ll be out’ — he’s still not out.”
 <br>
Chelsea Handler, New York Times, April 4, 2016[1]
 <br>
In 2015, Q Scores, the data gathering company that measures the “consumer appeal of personalities, characters, licensed properties, programs and brands,” delivered a report on the nation’s most disliked celebrities.[2] Perhaps unsurprisingly to her many critics, the reality television star and media empress Kim Kardashian ranked the highest negativity rating of any celebrity. Her score beat out such notable competition as serial rapist Bill Cosby, racist celebrity chef Paula Deen, and pop’s perpetual whipping boy, Justin Bieber, all of whom made infamous headlines that year. But the fact that she scored so poorly with viewers did not translate into a fall in popularity for her or her family’s media brand. Q Score Executive Vice President Henry Schafer believed that audiences enjoyed a “love to hate” relationship with Kim and that negativity worked for Kardashian because “That's how she markets herself.”[3]
<br>
This profound dislike for Kim and, by extension, the Kardashian family reflected an odd metric of popularity and taste in general, one certainly echoed by critics of their show Keeping Up with the Kardashians (KUWTK) and reality television in general. Reality TV and its stars have long made easy targets for popular and critical derision. From the drunken fights on the Real Housewives docu-soap franchise to the hixploitation of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and Swamp People, reality television often traffics in heavily-edited narratives, endless recaps, and outsized personalities that blur the line between stereotyping and engaged character development. Journalist and media studies scholar Sherri Williams has commented how “It seems that reality show directors and producers are not looking to cast whole, complete people. They’re casting types, and that leads to stereotyping.”[4] Over the past twenty years or so, networks have offered viewers the chance to watch America’s culture wars play out in the odd-couple pairings of Wife Swap or vicariously fulfill their DIY fantasies on Fixer Upper. Audiences can/should never feel certain that the stories played out before them maintain even the most tangential relationship to reality. Still, it seems network and cable stations have rushed to service an array of niche markets with their choice reality shows, while experts warn of its insidious influence. American popular culture reflects a market structure of an ever-increasing number of outlets for countless programming options, from AMC’s prestige shows like Mad Men to A&E’s Duck Dynasty. In the process, this fracturing of viewing markets has led to TV success on a scale of micropopularity in which the critically acclaimed Breaking Bad can find an audience along with KUWTK, an undoubtedly "lowbrow" production in the taste hierarchy.
<br>
Scholars have weighed in on the alleged pernicious influence of reality television and the Kardashian empire in particular with implication about how bad taste delivers bad consequences. Anecdotally, this year’s Praxis project on the Kardashians has elicited its share of raised eyebrows. While our cohort enjoyed unyielding support from the Scholars’ Lab staff, students of more traditionally “serious” scholarly subjects have shared their confused and patronizing comments about the importance and/or relevance of the topic. They are not alone in their dismissal and feigned concern. Social psychologist Bryan Gibson and his colleagues have concluded that viewing certain reality TV programming like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives increases a viewer’s aggressiveness.[5] Gibson has also gauged reality TV for its effects on the level of narcissism in its viewers. He categorizes KUWTK alongside shows like Real Housewives, The Bachelor, Basketball Wives, and Dance Moms as part of a reality TV trend that encourages self-obsession and the prioritization of appearances in its viewers.[6] An Australian study of reactions to celebrity and peer Instagram images echoes Gibson’s work. This survey of 138 undergraduate women found that exposure to images from celebrities like Kim Kardashian’s Instagram account, as well as images from normatively attractive peers, encouraged an increase in negative feelings about the viewer’s own body image.[7] Whether in the form of reality TV or social media, scholarly judgment fails to find much redeeming substance when it comes to the Kardashian family.
<br>
Other celebrities and pundits have also judged the Kardashians and found them lacking any redeeming content. Cosmopolitan aggregated a list of the 24 “meanest” opinions leveled against the family, with most of the scorn directed at Kim.[8] Comedians Chelsea Handler, Amy Schumer, and David Cross have treated Kim Kardashian like a Botox-filled piñata for their verbal beat downs. Referring to the entire family with characteristic delicacy, Cross conjectured how “They must sit there every day and go, ‘Um, uh, Kim, thank you so much for — remember when you sucked that guy’s dick and taped it and then released it and leaked it? . . . Thank you so much’. . . And it helps having an awful, shallow whore of a mother. That helps as well — to whore out your kids to make money.”[9] Other detractors were less imaginative, if no less subtle. Consider Barbara Walters statement to the family during a 2011 interview: “You don’t have any, forgive me, talent.”[10] Cross, Walters, and even social scientists seem to agree that the Kardashians add nothing to the commonweal and may even give evidence of a severe break in the social fabric.
<br>
At the heart of these judgments lies an indictment of authenticity­ –– an implication that the Kardashians are fake stars pulling a ruse on America. It makes sense that Handler might compare the Kardashians to Trump in this regard. Likewise, Cross and Walters cast the family as pseudo celebrities, pretenders to the throne of stardom who have sacrificed nothing while gaining immense fame and fortune. Cross’s statement even likens their rise to popularity to prostitution. Not only did Kim sell her performance of sex with rap artist Ray J for fame, but in Cross’s view, family matriarch Kris Jenner actively plays the role of madam/pimp, selling her children’s bodies for income. Mad Men star Jon Hamm chimed in as well in 2012, complaining, “Whether it’s Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian or whoever, stupidity is certainly celebrated. Being a fucking idiot is a valuable commodity in this culture because you’re rewarded significantly.”[11] No one needs to have real talent, these commenters imply. Sell your ignorance. Sell your body. Inauthenticity has won. Fake is the new real.
<br>
Oddly enough, these derisive opinions make Hamm and his fellow detractors sound less like employees of the same media-made star system as Kim and the family and more like mid-century cultural critics. In 1939, art critic Clement Greenberg published his seminal essay “Avant Garde and Kitsch” in the Partisan Review, lamenting that society seemed to be trading real art for kitsch. Real art, specifically the avant garde, conveyed authentic expression while kitsch traded in ersatz sentiment and built-in emotional responses. For Greenberg, kitsch included much of what we call pop culture: “popular, commercial art and literature with their chromeotypes, magazine covers, illustrations, ads, slick and pulp fiction, comics, Tin Pan Alley music, tap dancing, Hollywood movies, etc, etc.” In short, kitsch included all mass produced, mass consumed entertainment, which “pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money––­­not even their time.”[12] Like kitsch, the Kardashians seem to lack positive value, a judgment shared among all the opinions and social science data included here. Through their TV show and glamorous social media presence, the Kardashians mass-produce their own images to create an ersatz intimacy with their viewers and fans, turning themselves into mass-market commodities in the process. All the emotion is prepackaged and built-in. Fans must only turn on the television, open a tabloid, or check their Instagram accounts to consume what so many have deemed void of any value.
<br>
Yet such judgments of value are also judgments of taste, and judgments of taste are social judgments. In his study of Céline Dion, Let’s Talk About Love: A Journey to the End of Taste, music critic Carl Wilson explores why people become fans of an artist so patently uncool as Dion. Wilson builds off of Pierre Bourdieu’s Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste, noting that taste judgments are all about establishing boundaries used to distinguish one set of preferences from those deemed to be lower in the social hierarchy. But while Bourdieu drew these conclusions by analyzing the way taste corresponds to economic class, Wilson remains more interested in the cultural capital of “coolness” than any strict economic approach. He understands that holding cultural capital does not correlate to economic class, a fact evidenced by the middling incomes of taste-making, pop music writers (himself included).[13]
<br>
Being cool does not always pay well, but at least it delivers the cultural capital of top-tier taste distinctions and with it, a sense of superiority based on what one does not consume. You read The Paris Review, not US Weekly. You watch Girls, not KUWTK. Yet the demographics with the most cultural capital may even engage in ironic consumption of “bad” art or entertainment. As Wilson writes, “Having a ‘guilty pleasure,’ for instance, can be an asset in this system of cultural capital because it suggests that you are so cool that you can afford to risk it on something goofy, ungainly and awkward––which makes you that much cooler.”[14] So, maybe you do watch KUWTK, but you do so by “hate watching” as suggested by those Q Score findings. The Kardashians are worthless for so many critics because they hold no cultural capital, no symbolic power. They embody inauthenticity. They are all easy money and no taste. The only way to enjoy them and maintain credibility is by distancing oneself through ironic detachment if you want to maintain a place above them in the hierarchy of taste.
<br>
But not everyone who keeps up with the Kardashians is “hate watching.” And if the Kardashians are so vacuous and inauthentic, then what does it mean for someone to enjoy them genuinely? To answer these questions, our work digs past the superficial critiques of the Kardashian family’s rise to fame, their ostensibly valueless presence, and their perceived negative influence on society to analyze the content and context of their media empire. What might we find if we take seriously the idea the Kardashians might be engaged in positive emotional labor for the people who actually identify with them and their image? And what does it say about the harshest critics if they can so easily categorize the Kardashians and, by extension, their sincerest fans as valueless? Through the digital humanities methods outlined below, DASH-Amerikan uncovers the actual content of Kardashian media ecology to work past the easy critiques of, perhaps, the most famous and polarizing family in the United States.

<p>Other celebrities and pundits have also judged the Kardashians and found them lacking any redeeming content. Cosmopolitan aggregated a list of the 24 “meanest” opinions leveled against the family, with most of the scorn directed at Kim.<a class="footnote" id="n2-7">2-7</a> Comedians Chelsea Handler, Amy Schumer, and David Cross have treated Kim Kardashian like a Botox-filled piñata for their verbal beat downs. Referring to the entire family with characteristic delicacy, Cross conjectured how “They must sit there every day and go, ‘Um, uh, Kim, thank you so much for — remember when you sucked that guy’s dick and taped it and then released it and leaked it? . . . Thank you so much’. . . And it helps having an awful, shallow whore of a mother. That helps as well — to whore out your kids to make money.”<a class="footnote" id="n2-8">2-8</a> Other detractors were less imaginative, if no less subtle. Consider Barbara Walters statement to the family during a 2011 interview: “You don’t have any, forgive me, talent.”<a class="footnote" id="n2-9">2-9</a> Cross, Walters, and even social scientists seem to agree that the Kardashians add nothing to the commonweal and may even give evidence of a severe break in the social fabric. </p>

</div>
<p>At the heart of these judgments lies an indictment of authenticity­ –– an implication that the Kardashians are fake stars pulling a ruse on America. It makes sense that Handler might compare the Kardashians to Trump in this regard. Likewise, Cross and Walters cast the family as pseudo celebrities, pretenders to the throne of stardom who have sacrificed nothing while gaining immense fame and fortune. Cross’s statement even likens their rise to popularity to prostitution. Not only did Kim sell her performance of sex with rap artist Ray J for fame, but in Cross’s view, family matriarch Kris Jenner actively plays the role of madam/pimp, selling her children’s bodies for income. Mad Men star Jon Hamm chimed in as well in 2012, complaining, “Whether it’s Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian or whoever, stupidity is certainly celebrated. Being a fucking idiot is a valuable commodity in this culture because you’re rewarded significantly.”<a class="footnote" id="n2-10">2-10</a> No one needs to have real talent, these commenters imply. Sell your ignorance. Sell your body. Inauthenticity has won. Fake is the new real.</p>

  <h5>Greenberg, 39, 40.</h5>
</div>
<p>Oddly enough, these derisive opinions make Hamm and his fellow detractors sound less like employees of the same media-made star system as Kim and the family and more like mid-century cultural critics. In 1939, art critic Clement Greenberg published his seminal essay “Avant Garde and Kitsch” in the Partisan Review, lamenting that society seemed to be trading real art for kitsch. Real art, specifically the avant garde, conveyed authentic expression while kitsch traded in ersatz sentiment and built-in emotional responses. For Greenberg, kitsch included much of what we call pop culture: “popular, commercial art and literature with their chromeotypes, magazine covers, illustrations, ads, slick and pulp fiction, comics, Tin Pan Alley music, tap dancing, Hollywood movies, etc, etc.” In short, kitsch included all mass produced, mass consumed entertainment, which “pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money––­­not even their time.”<a class="footnote" id="n2-11">2-11</a> Like kitsch, the Kardashians seem to lack positive value, a judgment shared among all the opinions and social science data included here. Through their TV show and glamorous social media presence, the Kardashians mass-produce their own images to create an ersatz intimacy with their viewers and fans, turning themselves into mass-market commodities in the process. All the emotion is prepackaged and built-in. Fans must only turn on the television, open a tabloid, or check their Instagram accounts to consume what so many have deemed void of any value.</p>

  <h5>Carl Wilson, Let’s Talk About Love: A Journey to the End of Taste (New York and London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2011), 87-91.</h5>
</div>
<p>Yet such judgments of value are also judgments of taste, and judgments of taste are social judgments. In his study of Céline Dion, Let’s Talk About Love: A Journey to the End of Taste, music critic Carl Wilson explores why people become fans of an artist so patently uncool as Dion. Wilson builds off of Pierre Bourdieu’s Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste, noting that taste judgments are all about establishing boundaries used to distinguish one set of preferences from those deemed to be lower in the social hierarchy. But while Bourdieu drew these conclusions by analyzing the way taste corresponds to economic class, Wilson remains more interested in the cultural capital of “coolness” than any strict economic approach. He understands that holding cultural capital does not correlate to economic class, a fact evidenced by the middling incomes of taste-making, pop music writers (himself included).<a class="footnote" id="n2-12">2-12</a></p>


<div id= "foot-n2-13" class="footnotebox">
  <span class="close">&times;</span>
  <h5>Ibid., 92.</h5>
</div>
<p>Being cool does not always pay well, but at least it delivers the cultural capital of top-tier taste distinctions and with it, a sense of superiority based on what one does not consume. You read The Paris Review, not US Weekly. You watch Girls, not KUWTK. Yet the demographics with the most cultural capital may even engage in ironic consumption of “bad” art or entertainment. As Wilson writes, “Having a ‘guilty pleasure,’ for instance, can be an asset in this system of cultural capital because it suggests that you are so cool that you can afford to risk it on something goofy, ungainly and awkward––which makes you that much cooler.”<a class="footnote" id="n2-13">2-13</a> So, maybe you do watch KUWTK, but you do so by “hate watching” as suggested by those Q Score findings. The Kardashians are worthless for so many critics because they hold no cultural capital, no symbolic power. They embody inauthenticity. They are all easy money and no taste. The only way to enjoy them and maintain credibility is by distancing oneself through ironic detachment if you want to maintain a place above them in the hierarchy of taste.</p>

<p>But not everyone who keeps up with the Kardashians is “hate watching.” And if the Kardashians are so vacuous and inauthentic, then what does it mean for someone to enjoy them genuinely? To answer these questions, our work digs past the superficial critiques of the Kardashian family’s rise to fame, their ostensibly valueless presence, and their perceived negative influence on society to analyze the content and context of their media empire. What might we find if we take seriously the idea the Kardashians might be engaged in positive emotional labor for the people who actually identify with them and their image? And what does it say about the harshest critics if they can so easily categorize the Kardashians and, by extension, their sincerest fans as valueless? Through the digital humanities methods outlined below, DASH-Amerikan uncovers the actual content of Kardashian media ecology to work past the easy critiques of, perhaps, the most famous and polarizing family in the United States. </p>
<br>
<h2> III. Historical Context of Celebrity, Marketing and Performative Promotion</h2>
<br>
<p>
<br>
Kim Kardashian has been noted as a trailblazer in the utilization of 21st century social media technologies for self-promotion, is a consistent practitioner of the “selfie,” and maintains a steady devotion to Instagram and other social media for the promotion of her personal brand and reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  Millions of fans “keep up” with the Kardashian brand through social media, celebrity tabloids, and “entertainment” sections of news websites.  The Kardashian empire has encouraged, to a large extent, fan interactivity with the digital brand— Kim Kardashian has over 50 million followers on Twitter and Instagram, which for many creates a personal sense of connection to the Kardashians. The show itself has a strong presence on social media, and fans are encouraged to download and use the “cellphone apps” created by Kim and her sisters.
<br>
What is the nature of this celebrity interactivity? Does interaction with celebrities through social media provide users with a hope that some element of stardom will somehow brush off onto them?  Joshua Gamson wonders whether modern conceptions of fame offer a kind of “pseudo-participation,” where fans may believe that stardom is not only accessible to celebrities, but to themselves as well.[3]  This question of “pseudo-participation” is particularly relevant in the era of Twitter and Instagram, which encourage fan interaction with stars.  How authentic, however, is this interaction?  In Marwick and Boyd’s study of celebrity Twitter accounts, “From a sample of 144 highly followed accounts, we determined that 105 were written by individual famous people, 7 by a team (publicists, assistants, and so on), 11 by a team plus the celebrity, and 21 were indeterminate.”[4]  However, the platform itself does not make it possible to determine precisely with whom one is interacting when one contacts a “celebrity.” When today, marketing with hashtags and crowd interaction are intertwined with the very cultural production itself—the consumers, along with the producers are “performing the production,” and further reinforcing the Kardashian brand.
<br>
The status of the Kardashian brand in contemporary American society is impossible to understand without looking back to celebrity and marketing in the 20th century and before, and how modern celebrity practice was influenced by changes in technology and the expansion of the entertainment industry. [6] Promotion of celebrity status through performative practice has existed since the very notion of celebrity itself, and our modern understanding of celebrity according to Fred Inglis’ A Short History of Celebrity dates to the mid-1700s.  Inglis sees a great difference between modern fame spectacles and pre-modern ceremonies.  He notes the distinction between of the Royal Progresses of Elizabeth II and modern spectacles of celebrity, which he states as having emerged in the mid-18th century.[1] Within the context of the development of late-18th century industrialization, marketing and promotional activities vastly expanded in order to reach consumers, with individual entrepreneurs and companies employing varied methods of promotion.  While print marketing was commonplace, novel promotional techniques were experimented with in the 19th century— Joshua Gamson notes some of the earliest examples of celebrity promotion, and draws attention to the unique marketing practices in P. T. Barnum’s performative stunts of the late 19th century.[2] In the 21st century, marketing practices have perhaps taken a page out of Barnum’s book, and become increasingly performative with the encouragement of brand engagement through a variety of social media platforms.
<br>
Media reproduction and the photographic and video technology changed the very nature of media itself in the 20th century, as noted by critics like Walter Benjamin and Leo Lowenthal. Benjamin saw the capabilities of image reproduction to be a watershed moment that overturned prior understanding of the nature of images themselves, and had vital ramifications for the worlds of art, media, and marketing.  Constant image reproduction, in Benjamin’s view, led to the loss of an “aura” inherent in pre-technological reproduction of images.[5]
<br>
Frankfurt School critic, Leo Lowenthal, noted the changing nature of celebrity in the essay “The Triumph of Mass Idols,” (1944) in which he compared literary biographies of the 1900s and 1910s to those of the 1920s and 1930s.  Lowenthal’s finding is that the more recent biographies are focused on stars produced for mass-consumption, heralding a new of type of celebrity whose image is more vital than the actual things that they create or produce.[6] The post-WWII era saw a new phase in the refinement of marketing for the promotion of commodities.  Indeed, Margaret Mead noted in 1956 “There is not a culture of America, but a culture of Madison Avenue.”[7]  In this era celebrity and marketing meshed together in a way that blurred the edges between celebrity and marketing. The idea of people who are “famous for being famous” came into existence with Daniel Boorstin’s (1961) take on the state of American culture in The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, where Boorstin notably proclaimed celebrities as “human pseudo-events.”[8] Are the Kardashian merely a continuation of Boorstin’s observation, but with the utilization of new technologies? Are we simply experiencing spectacles and “pseudo-events” through new mediums?
<br>
It could be said that the public is drawn to the artificial, surface-level aspects of the Kardashian media machine.  However, beyond the promotional, profit-oriented aspects of celebrity marketing promotion, do we see genuine concerns in the Kardashian marketing machine? Especially with the utilization of social media in mind, can bits of actual authenticity exist interlaced within a constructed illusion of authenticity?  Our corpus of tweets revealed activism for recognition of the Armenian geocide and other socially focused goals.  Thus, in their media ecologies, the Kardashian are neither purely promotional nor purely authentic.  The same platforms are used for multiple purposes in the Kardashian media landscape, whether they are profit-oriented or otherwise. In 2015, the series premieres of Keeping Up with the Kardashians outperformed the final season of the critically-acclaimed AMC show Mad Men. Somewhat ironically, is there a bridge between the Kardashians and the mid-century advertising executives of Madison Avenue? Has what Margaret Mead called the “culture of Madison Avenue” in 2017 been supplanted by the “culture of the smartphone, the selfie, and the hashtag”?  As one of the of the most successful self-promoters using these technologies, does Kim Kardashian have an instinctive feel for marketing and self-promotion in contemporary American culture that makes her more like Don Draper than anyone would have ever suspected?
<br>

<h2>Fanfiction, Fan Response, and Adoption</h2>


<p>
  At several moments during the project we’ve inquired whether the kinds of conversations we've seen in the media presented by the personal and corporate entities of the Kardashians are conversations that are shared by their followers and fans. In order to identify and possibly understand conversational through-lines, the Karshashian's convergence culture, we thought we might look to some of the most engaged Kardashian fans—fanfiction writers. Since the late nineties, scholars have been studying the cultural phenomena of fan fiction, or the fannish practice of writing fiction using the characters and the worlds of beloved books, television shows, movies, and, etc.<a class="footnote" id="n3">3</a>  Fanfiction gives us even more ideas about the establishment of a Kardashian cultural community as well as the possible reification and rejection of particular discourses surrounding Kardashian celebrity. Or, what, if anything, are Kardashian fans producing in their position within the Kardashian media ecology?

</div>
<p>
  The digital writing platform Wattpad provides a new community of young amateur writers to consider and interrogate. Unlike other fanfiction communities and archives, writers of Kardashian fanfiction produce most frequently on Wattpad. And it is interesting to note that these writers are young, generally teenaged. Unlike other popular fan fiction archives Wattpad operates on popularity metrics of "most viewed" and  often publishes their popular author's <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/imagines-celebrity-encounters-starring-you-preview/">finished work</a>. The writers' choice of archive and its potential for monetization (Wattpad writer Anna Todd made a six-figure deal for her popular One Direction fanfiction in 2015) is particularly interesting when read through the lens of the Kardashians who always monetize the personal and the amateur. <a class="footnote" id="n4">4</a>

<p>
  In the tradition of fan fiction studies, we used fanfiction works, especially metadata, as a place to further interrogate the producer-consumer relations of the Kardashians and their audience. In order to begin sifting through this writing community, we built a scraping tool what collected metadata from stories that were tagged indicating they were about the Kardashians. Part of the tradition of fan fiction is a practice of generating effusive and specific tags and descriptions for stories. Thus, it seems potentially more interesting to see how authors not only are writing but also theorizing their own stories. What might we find in collective meta-engagement with individual works?
</p>
<br>
<p>
  At first look, the themes within the canon of of Kardashian fanfiction seem to stick to two major tropes: a) the narrator finds she is a missing Kardashian sister and is rescued(!) from obscurity, or b) the narrator is adopted by a Kardashian or Jenner sister. The final scenario is decidedly a "group text" genre in which the writer is imagining what might happen in celebrity group chat. These stories generally feature Kylie and Kendall.
  It's notable that these narratives misalign with the trends of a majority of fanfiction, the romantic male-driven slash story. [add a link from dailydot]. In fact, without strong tragic narratives in need of "fixing" or male leads to transform into lovers, the Kardashian fandom manages to turn most fanfiction writing practices on their heads.

</p></div>

<p>
  When we turn to topic modeling of the descriptions we see these themes of adoption and communication solidify anew. At 20 topics, relationships, especially familial, present themselves throughout. These themes become especially apparent looking at topics 4, 5, 6, and 8 (which can be found in the modal window above). The topics of fame and family are interspersed throughout, and we see the alignment of Kardashian interest and response to it by fans. The same goes for topics of celebrity and their close ties to family or friendship. The concept of narrative ("story," "reading," "books," "writing") pops up across topics.  We see the the influence of not only the act of writing, but also the ways in which the Kardashians fashion themselves as particular kinds of story-tellers (as reality tv personalities, producers of said show, and general content producers).  Thus the themes of the show, family, legacy, matriarchy, are mostly reified through their writing fan base.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  What we don't see in these fan interactions is the critique that often accompanies transformative fannish writing and fan response. We don't even see the mild interrogations of the tabloid writer or the sharp, quick-witted commentary of the twitter community. For these fanfiction writers, to keep up with the Kardashians is to love them, to insert themselves fully into their lives, to be recognized and accepted within the Kardashian matriarchal lineage.<a class="footnote" id="n5">5</a>

<h2>data collection</h2>

<p>
  This section narrates our process for collecting and cleaning various Kardashian archives, which we produce here to serve as a full listing of our materials as well as to provide information on best practices for these data types. It’s important to note that our efforts were primarily aimed at creating a textual archive, since the tools and methods to explore text seemed more robust to us than any other alternative.
</p>
<br>
<h8>Closed Captioning</h8>
<br>
<p>
  We gathered closed captioning transcripts for 11 seasons of the flagship Kardashian reality TV show, Keeping up with the Kardashians. To do so, we used the open-source <a href="https://www.ccextractor.org/"> CCExtractor</a> and a the video streaming site Hulu. CCExtractor gave us works with two file types, .srt and .vtt. The .srt files are created by running optical character recognition on video subtitles, much the same way other “OCR” software scans and saves text files from scans of printed pages. The more reliable .vtt format, on the other hand, is a web standard for closed caption files that can be downloaded directly since it is meant to be retrieved by the browser and then displayed on top of streaming video. Both file types have a similar format, however, where the text from the captions is displayed beside a timestamp for the video and the name of the line’s speaker.
</p>
<img class="kiss" id="k4" src="kardashiankiss.png" alt="kiss">
<div id="kiss-k4" class="kiss-body kissbox">
<p>.vtt format for televison dialogue<iframe width="600" height="400" src="cc.png" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p></div>
<br>
<p>
  While the timestamp information has obvious uses for other data-centric analysis of television or movies, we chose to remove the time stamps from our files in order to focus on the dialogue and speakers. To do so, we used an <a href="https://www.rev.com/captionconverter">online converter </a> to change the files to .txt and  remove the time stamps and formatting characters that we did not need. While many of these tasks took time, particularly the process of retrieving each episode, they were relatively straightforward once we had determined the best workflow.
</p>

<br>
<h8>Twitter</h8>
<br>
<p>
We took a number of approaches to data mining Twitter over the course of the year. Our first efforts used the statistical computing language R, and <a href="https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet"> the package rtweet</a>. This gave us relatively easy to use access to Twitter’s streaming API, allowing us to retrieve recent tweets around keywords related to the Kardashians and even a certain number of tweets from the accounts themselves. While rtweet and the streaming API affords us useful tools for retrieving data on events (for example trending topics) in real time, it was quite limited as a tool for archiving older tweets. It was particularly useful in becoming acquainted with the formatting and metadata associated with tweets downloaded in the JSON file format.<a class="footnote" id="n3-1">3-1</a>
</p>
<div id= "foot-n3-1" class="footnotebox">
  <span class="close">&times;</span>
  <h5>JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation, a standardized format that merges human readability with an easy way to manipulate the data inside. It is composed of a series of comma separated values that are individually tagged and placed within entries separated by curly brackets.</h5>
</div>

<br>
<p>
  It soon became clear, however, that we would need to delve further into the twitter archive to explore the data we were most interested in around the Kardashians. We noticed that we could circumvent the streaming API’s limitations by viewing old tweets with Twitter’s advanced search function. Using the browser, it was simple to display tweets by user, hashtag, and most importantly, timestamp range dating back to the beginnings of twitter.  While this was an unsuitably halting way to explore very old tweets, it provided us with proof of concept at least; Twitter’s own tools for searching through tweets could be used to find whatever archives we would ultimately settle on. After some diligent Googling, we came across Tom Dickinson’s writeup of Twitter-scraping with Python using the advanced search feature.  <a href="http://tomkdickinson.co.uk/2015/01/scraping-tweets-directly-from-twitters-search-page-part-1/"> Dickinson's code</a> was quite easy to adapt for our purposes, and in short order we were able to gather the complete twitter archive of the relevant Kardashians. The script works by constructing a URL from fields that the user inputs (username, tweet text, date range etc) and scraping tweets into JSON files using the Python library Beautiful Soup. The script is even quite speedy; by using “multithreading” to access the relevant tweets through multiple parallel queries to the page, it is capable of retrieving many thousands of tweets a minute. All that remained was to combine the JSON files representing each thread in the command line.
</p>
<br>
<h8>Us Weekly</h8>
<br>
<p>
    Like our Twitter scraping tool, our Us Weekly article scraper used Python’s Beautiful Soup library. To gather our Kardashian article cache, we navigated to the page which listed all articles with the Kardashian tag. Using beautiful soup’s HTML parser, our script automatically retrieved the headline and url of each article, creating a CSV file with the article titles and location. This file was then used to open each URL and download the contents of the article. This way, we would have a file indexing the major topics covered by Us Weekly alongside the full text of the articles, which we would later use in our topic modeling analysis.
</p>
<br>
<h8>best practices for the archive</h8>
<br>
<div id= "foot-n3-3" class="footnotebox">
  <span class="close">&times;</span>
  <h5>DocNow does this by enabling users to scrape twitter-id numbers, which are unique to each tweet, but can be deleted by the user</h5>
</div>

<p>
  Part of the difficulty with social media archives is their huge value to corporations for the purposes of targeted advertising and gauging public sentiment. For this reason, platforms like twitter have a vested interest in keeping the content of tweets locked to some degree within their own system. Nevertheless, twitter offers certain archival opportunities that other social media platforms do not. While over the lifespan of Twitter, its APIs (Application Program Interfaces) have been restricted somewhat, they still allow for “streaming” tweets, creating “bot” accounts, and gathering data on retweets, responses, and ‘likes’.
  Because the social media data we were interested in present many curatorial problems, we looked to many scholarly organizations that have thought deeply about best archival practices. Documenting the Now, in particular, offered through tools that could enable research on twitter archives while respecting user privacy and abiding by twitter’s terms of service. <a class="footnote" id="n3-3">3-3</a>
  Even the best tools require constant maintenance. Our twitter scraper is currently operational, but it depends on the architecture of twitter. It constructs URLs according to the way Twitter’s advanced search operates, but those URLs are liable to change at any time. Moreover, Twitter has a vested interest in preventing commercial use of a tool like ours. They sell their own suite of data mining tools as a monthly subscription well beyond what most humanities projects could afford.

<h8>Topic Modeling: Distant Reading the Kardashians</h8>
<br>
<p>
  We experience and interact with the Kardashians on a daily basis, be it scrolling through our Facebook feed, scanning the tabloid headlines at the grocery store, or even skimming the New York Times.  While a large audience engages with these materials, another group rolls their eyes and moves on with their day.  Yet they still have consumed.  What happens when we play with this distant form of consumption and engage with it as an academic tool?  Can we read parallels between this type of consumption and the digital humanities methodology of distant reading?
</p>
<br>
<p>
Distant reading was introduced to the humanities in by Franco Moretti.  This method of studying literature uses digital methods to aggregate and analyze text with the goal of uncovering the fundamentals of literature on a vast, universal level.  It poses itself as the opposite of close reading, which focuses on singular and often exceptional canonized texts.  Moretti wrote of the method, "we know how to read texts, now let's learn how not to read them."<a class="footnote" id="n4-1">4-1</a>
</p>

  <span class="close">&times;</span>
  <h5>Cecire, "Ways of Not Reading Gertrude Stein," 291.</h5>
</div>

<br>
<p>
Natalia Cecire counters Moretti's statement, suggesting that while Moretti's intellectual goals include moving beyond the 1% of literature that comprises of the canon, he is nevertheless propagating notions of canonization.  Time equals work, which then equals value. Consequently, through the process of distant reading, one is declaring that one is not willing to put in the work to read a corpus and therefore it is of little value.  Cecire evokes Gertrude Stein, an author both part of the cannon and considered "unreadable" by critics: "Distant reading is women's work, and Gertrude Stein shows us why.  If distant reading is-avowedly-a compromised form of reading, then what does it mean to distant read Stein's The Making of Americans (1925)?"<a class="footnote" id="n4-2">4-2</a>
By situating the approach of distant reading "within the history of ways of not reading Gertrude Stein-a history of media, women's labor, and the status of literature" she points to the fear of the corporeal body of the female author of which Stein's literature continually evokes.  Stein's body, the source of her labor, "fat, female, lesbian, and Jewish [...] is conventionally seen as the source of her (unreadable, not worth reading) writing."<a class="footnote" id="n4-3">4-3</a>
</pr>



<p><br>
  A distant reading of the Kardashian corpus cannot escape these paradigms and contradictions.  How can we acknowledge all the types of female labor of which the Kardashian corpus under analysis is the byproduct?  The majority of the Kardashian enterprise focuses exclusively on the corporeal form, presenting a sexualized-often exoticized-feminine ideal.  What happens when we study this corpus as purely textual?  One can argue that it allows the academic, who is predisposed to judgement, a sense of neutrality.  Therefore, by removing the visual from this particular equation, we can study the Kardashians on their own terms.  It should be noted that distant reading, through topic modeling, was a methodology chosen based on practicality.  How does one "catch up" on twelve seasons of Keeping Up with the Kardashians and read every single tweet over the course of 8 years?
</p>

<br>

<p>
  Distant reading allowed for themes we would have otherwise not have been able to grasp over the course of a year of binge-watching <i>KUWTK</i> and challenged the dominant narratives about the Kardashians that viewers passively consume.  It further allowed us to parse out the authorship, independence and individuality of tweets.  It became very clear that whether or not the Kardashian women have personal assistants curating their social media presence, they have each created a unique authorial voice distinct from their sisters.  With an acknowledgment that this is not how the average viewer consumes the Kardashians, we have enacted close readings of specific episodes with the aim of rectifying this imbalance and acknowledging the labor intensive nature of television and social media production.

<h8>Closed Captions: Motherhood</h8>

<br>

<p>
  The topic modeling of the closed captions was perhaps the most revelatory to the non-Kardashian viewer, revealing entire plot arcs throughout the shows twelve seasons.  The topics included their business ventures (The dash boutique), planning weddings, modeling, their social lives, vacations, and more generally, all the men in their lives.  The only male Kardashian not related by marriage, Rob, was tied directly to his depression and weight problems, which the women are constantly disparaging him for.  The topic cluster “liar sexual video reggie” points us to the early seasons of KUWTK in which the Kardashians are jettisoned into the public eye due to the release of Kim Kardashian’s sex tape.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  More so than the topics most associated with the Kardashians—money, fame, sex—a clear narrative focus on motherhood emerges.  All aspects of motherhood become a central focus of the television show and the foundation of primary social relationships.  For example, the topic modeling reveals Kim Kardashian’s marriage to Kris Humphries as one primarily in terms of children: “humphries wedding dude surgery bible food hump moment minnesota marry baby question babe part marriage bed health,” and again in the cluster “sex pregnant married” and “she’s pregnant babe age corey eddie.”  The emotional and often sensitive issue of fertility is discussed with open frankness (“doctor eggs fertility kids surgery body vasectomy birth nervous ovulate boobs ovulating”).  This topic cluster revealed a multiplicity of episodes featuring Khloe’s troubles with fertility and Kim’s desire for a third child after her difficult second pregnancy.  Once pregnant, the social aspects of those nine months are clustered together in the same group as gun safety: “gun baby shower house guns safety Kanye safe hines camel range family shooting”.  The actual births of these children are, in keeping with Kardashian brand's frankness about the female body during pregnancy, discussed openly as seen in the cluster “baby doctor doctors breech.” This candor should be taken as one befitting the genre of reality tv in which they are situated, a genre of television which revisits, relives, and discusses these issues from the safety of the interview chair or the pristine white sofa.  The Kardashian sisters lounge with a glass of wine and rehash the days’ or weeks’ events, often avoiding the representation of this viscerally feminine events—ultimately sanitizing the biological aspects of femininity for a television viewing public.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  However, this sanitation is countered by clear instances of graphic bodily functions. In season four, Kourtney's water breaks and she continues to walk around the house leaking, her younger sisters Kendall and Kyle shrieking in disgust.  The viewer watches a calm and nude Kourtney shave her legs and do her makeup before departing for the hospital.  Finally, Kourtney is shown giving birth to her son Mason, surrounded by her sisters.  In a visceral moment of female bodily power, Kourtney reaches down and pulls the newborn from her vagina, resting him on her chest before having him cleaned.

  The umbilical cord is then cut on screen by her boyfriend Scott.  The event is re-enacted for a second time when Khloé describes the experience of seeing her sister give birth: "and she just reaches down and pulls him out!  And is like, 'oh my child!' and I'm like... 'I think you ripped something!  That is not normal!'

  Later in an interview, Kim describes the newborn as an Armenian baby, emphasizing the genetic makeup of the Kardashians: "He's so hairy and Armenian, it really shows how strong the Kardashian genes are."

  In this episode, the Kardashian women enact their femininity through the female body's reproductive powers: the process of giving labor, the strength of their genetic makeup, and lastly through the mother's return to the work place.  The episode of Mason's birth ends with Kourtney announcing she is returning to Miami to revive the struggling Dash store.  KUWTK reminds their viewers that this is a show about matriarchy; women are mothers, sexual objects, and the primary breadwinners of the family.

</p>

<br>

<p>
  Maria Pramaggiore and Diane Negia have interpreted the Kardashian’s candor about the female body as representative of a postfeminist version of female empowerment, one which endorses gender equality as a combination of commercial success, luxury consumption, and sexual objectification.   Yet, this interpretation ignores the fundamental differences between the glossy touched up curves of Kim’s celebrated derriere in fashion spreads and the television show’s visceral evocation of the female body as messy and biological.
The space between these dual portrayals of the Kardashian body is society’s fear of the abject, that which transgresses and threatens societal visions of cleanliness, particularly as it relates to the female form. The removal of hair, the air brushing away of moles and pores becomes the means in which to deny the female body its objectivity and abjectivity, and declare it a literal object.
</p>

<br>

<p>
The Kardashians continually self-represent themselves in this polished form.  Yet they challenge this through the reference and depiction of the body as an abject subject capable of private bodily functions, not to mention pregnancy, labor, breastfeeding, and all the stages of procreation beyond the body’s initial sexual objectification.  In the most recent season, Kim, eager for a third child undergoes a high risk surgery on her uterus, resulting in a bladder infection which forces her to use a catheter.

In this case, no liquids are shown. Kim, hauling her catheter around and complaining that she “just wants to go to the bathroom” is played upon for comic relief.  However, the catheter bares a reminder that Kim’s sexualized body, seen on the covers of Playboy and Paper Magazine, is in fact a body in the biological sense of the term.  This physicality is brought to the forefront in Season 6, Episode 3, when Kim has her derriere x-rayed to prove to her critics that she has not had any artificial enhancements.  Kim justifies her decision in an onscreen interview: “People ask me all the time if my butt is real […] [T]his has been going on for years and it’s so ridiculous.  I’ve said it numerous times I haven’t had plastic surgery, I haven’t had implants […].”

 The public’s refusal to see Kim’s body as an authentic corporeal presence in its own right illuminates societal fears and suspicions of the abject female form.  As Alexandra Sastre has deftly argued, the authenticity of Kim Kardashian’s body places it alongside a history of the fragmentation of the female body, posing Kim as a modern day Hottentot Venus: “[A]fter years of public display before European audiences, Sarah Baartman’s racialized body was also taken apart after her death and re-inscribed as a medical specimen, a dehumanized artifact and object of study.  In Kardashian’s case, the fragmentation is not literal, but as a representational pulling-apart it is more than metaphoric; only her butt is seen, and nothing of the rest of her body, reiterating its operationalization as a synecdoche for the authenticity of her entire self.” Unlike Baartman, Kim’s whiteness allows her to “capitali[ze] on a body that in her case is positively marked as ‘exotic’ without any of the burdens that typically also accompany that designation.”
 </p>

 <br>
<p>
 Kardashian media signals at nearly every opportunity that the family is a story about matriarchy. Its stock characters, like Kourtney Kardashian’s intermittent partner and co-parent Scott Disick, or the hapless Robert Kardashian, tend to be male. The Kardashian sisters place motherhood and family at the center of their narratives, but the father role often involves more absenteeism than full participation. Disick is perhaps the most obvious example of this narrative trend. Present as an inveterate shit-stirrer for the KUWTK writing staff, Disick’s constant re-appearance and departure from the show and media surrounding the Kardashians ensures a constant stream of drama. In contrast to the instability and unreliability of father figures in the Kardashian world, the Kardashian matriarchy makes a case for the importance of motherhood and competent mothering in a pop-cultural landscape that can often sequester the feminine within minor roles.
 </p>

 <br>

 <p>
   Part of the reason we’ve been drawn to the Kardashians is the critical aversion surrounding the show that marks it as frivolous and superficial. But underlying the spectacle of Kardashian imagery is an insistence on matriarchy. Kardashian women are not only careful curators of their own image, in collaboration with visual artists, stylists, and designers of all stripes, but also representations of motherhood. While of course the Kardashians opt for a glossy depiction of motherhood, their insistence on the importance of the category ‘mother’ is a stark contrast to the media commenting upon their lives as mothers. Our cache of [**#**] Us Weekly articles reveals the ways in which motherhood is erased--correlating maternity vocabulary with and obsession with ‘baby-weight’ and the ‘correction’ of the body following pregnancy.

Again, there is an attempt to control and neutralize the abject female form often seen on KUWTK.  This is particularly emphasized in the strict and continual coverage of the Kardashian’s red carpet appearances and photo shoots.

The tabloids also covered the Kardashian presence on social media. “twitter kim march nude tweeted selfie butt naked”.  This is fascinating since the Kardashian presence on social media, according to our topic modeling results, correlates far more with the image of the Kardashians presented in US Weekly than their very own television show.  Like the majority of social media users, the Kardashian’s present a performative glossy lifestyle of the rich and famous through their use of twitter; the frank treatment of their bodies as seen on KUWTK complete vanishes.
 </p>
<br>

<h8>Tweets as an Alternative Version of <i>KUWTK</i></h8>
<br>

<p>
The majority of the tweets from the Kardashians are self promotional, encouraging fans to tune on Sunday evening for new episodes of KUWTK, or advertising sponsored content (affectionally known as #spon #sponcon).  More than everyone, self described "momager" Kris Jenner promotes the careers of the family and her daughters' individual endeavors (often tagged with #proudmama).

The frank candor of Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé on KUWTK described above is removed.  Instead they, like their "momager," promote shared Kardashian-family interests.

The promotional angle of their tweet corpus includes additional references to their online presence. For example, Khloé celebrates the success of her and her family's social media presence in this topic cluster: "follow twitter followers million khloedaily woohoo wow finally lets dolls step front page instagram hit fire."  Meanwhile, Kim introduces her own personal online endeavors, including kimojis (Kim Kardashian themed emojis): "app kimoji today download phone kimkardashianwest.com working update store.kimkardashianwest.com keek store kimojimerch website alert bae."
</p>
<br>

<p>
  While much of the twitter corpuses of all the Kardashians are in line with each other, all promoting a similar endeavor (KUWTK). Each member of the family does take on their own authorial voice, focusing on subjects that pertain to their individual lives or personalities.  Kris, having embraced the role as "momager," has a twitter presence that is far more promotional than her daughters.  On the other hand, we can see vestiges of Khloe's marriage to the basketball player Lamar Odom ("game lakers let's laker mavs yay team tonight usa win won clipper energy play reallamarodom games great baby time") while also getting more personal information about her, such as her insomnia ("sleep can't ugh time man bed hate hours thing leave hope guess tired back sucks lamar insomina").  Two topic clusters in particular separate Khloe's twitter from her sisters: "lord love heart god blessings blessed amen life forever give pray family strength blessing thankful soul angel peace everyday giving" and "people don't positive life feel change world make hate every thing matter bad negative things respect live small deep mind." More so than anyone else, Khloe's twitter is filled with these inspirational and prophetic sayings and quotations.  Because this is unique to the topic model of Khloé's twitter, I would argue that it speaks to her personal authorial voice: she, more than her sisters, is inclined to discuss such subject matter and use a certain style of language that allows for these terms to be clustered together.
</p>

<br>

<p>

  We see a similar unique personality emerge in Kim Kardashian's twitter.  Although Kim, Kourtney, Khloé and Rob Kardashian are all of Armenian descent through their father Robert Kardashian (the Jenners are, it should be noted, not Armenian), Kim is the only one to tweet about Armenian culture and the genocide on a regular basis.  While Kourtney and Khloé do mention Armenia, the frequency through which discusses allows for it to receive is own cluster.  For example, Armenia appears in Khloé tweet topic model as follows: "love real person girl world favorite princess truth end people quotes armenian mother perfect sad sweetest find earth mileycyrus." The fact that Armenian, truth (referring to Armenian genocide deniers), and Miley Cyrus are in the same cluster speaks to this infrequency.  Kourtney's twitter is similar: "red dubai armenian people loved carpet trip today april hotel major vintage meeting days armenia millions shopping milkshakes kuwait fools." This cluster shows us that she was actually live tweeting the epsiode of the Kardashians in which Khloé and Kim go to Armenia for the one hundredth anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.  During the trip they are hosted by the Megerian carpet factory that produces traditional Armenian textiles.  However, these tweets are also compiled together with others tweets regarding the middle east--specifically the Kardashian sisters' trip to Dubai.  In contrast, the topic model cluster from Kim's tweets stands very clearly as promoting her identity as Armenian and informing and educating about the Armenian genocide:  "people armenian power join stand april truth bro real genocide armo pray proud.”  Although the cluster suggests that Kim only discusses Armenia in terms of the Genocide, a closer anlaysis of the metadata provided by this cluster, revealed tweets with a more social nature, in which she tweets about Armenian food and notable Armenians in pop culture.
</p>

<br>

<p>

  In many ways, Kim's engagement with the Armenian culture sheds light on understandings of inherited cultural memory as experienced by second- and third-generation Americans.  With the familial loss of the Armenian language

  and, more crucially, the loss of the Kardashian patriarch Robert Kardashian, a distance between the Kardashian's lived experience and their Armenian heritage emerges. In an effort to bridge this gulf, the Kim has turned to key markers of ethnic identity.  The experience of Armenian cuisine, both cooking and eating, provides a means for the Kardashians, particularly Kim, to perform her Armenian identity.  She tweets multiple times about beeshee, an Armenian thin crispy pancake covered in sugar.  The beeshee becomes a comfort food that recalls memories of her father and the Armenian heritage she associates with him.
  When Kim and Kourtney travel to Armenia for the  100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide,
  she tweets about the trip in terms of the food she hopes to experience, followed by the hashtag "#MyDADAndGrandParentsWouldBeSoProud." Kim's immediate association with Armenia to food, rather than an innocuous statement, highlights the means through which immigrant populations choose to (or not to) assimilate to dominant cultural traditions.  This is further tied to specific family members who continued specific cultural traditions that Kim sees as foundational to her Armenian-American identity.  Although the Kardashians are Armenian through their father's side, Kim still sees the matriarchal structure of her life as directly tied to her heritage, tweeting: "Visiting Mother Armenia yesterday. This statue reminds visitors of the strong female figures in Armenian history." {"tweet_id": "586379174048206850"} This connection is doubly emphasized when Kim chooses to announce the pregnancy of her second child while in Armenia, followed with the baptism her daughter North in the oldest Orthodox church in the Armenian quarter of Jerusalem. Kim becomes  a mother in "Mother Armenia."
</p>

<br>

<p>

  The majority of Kim's tweets about Armenia, however, revolve around the annual commemoration of the Armenian Genocide.  The Armenian-American community remains deeply shaped by the Armenian Genocide (1915-1920), in which over a million Armenians were systematically murdered at the hands of the Turkish government.  The impetus for the primary wave of Armenian immigration to the United States, the genocide has become an important origin story, or cultural primal scene, for Armenian-American cultural identity.  Beyond the collective familial trauma caused by such a violent loss of human life and country, the Armenian-American identification with the Genocide is multiplied by the United States's continual refusal to refer to the events that took place in 1915 as a genocide, due to delicate political relations with Turkey. This disavowal via words of omission has and continues to be a point of contention among American-Armenians.  Kim Kardashian's main activist goal is the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the United States government.  In an op-ed in Time, Kardashian wrote "I would like President Obama to use the word genocide. It’s very disappointing he hasn't used it as President [...] It is time for Turkey to recognize it [the genocide]."

  Kim Kardashian uses her platforms on social media to bring attention to the subject of the Armenian Genocide in the same terms she promotes an episode of KUWTK.  For example, on April 24, 2012 Kardashian encouraged her followers to get the topic trending by using the hashtag #ArmenianGenocide.

  While this move seems to promote a false sense of latent activism, Kim has encouraged more direct forms of political engagement.  On December 9, 2010 she tweeted "Everyone: Please call Speaker Pelosi TODAY at 202-225-0100 and URGE her to schedule a vote on H.Res.252, the Armenian Genocide Resolution."

  While critics of the Kardashian empire could qualify her activism as a marketing scheme to promote and improve her public image, the presentness of the Armenian genocide in the Armenian-American collective memory suggests a more authentic reading of her activism.

</p>

<br>

<p>

Kim Kardashian's Armenian identity shapes her own view of her body, (re: her description of those "strong Kardashian genes").  Nevertheless, the sexualization and presentation of Kim's body verges into the territory of cultural appropriation, where a white body is being positioned in an exotic frame through the evocation of African American and Hispanic beauty standards.  In the very first episode of KUWTK, Kris Jenner points to her daughter as a sexualized object.  Kim has, she says, "a little junk in the trunk."

Alexandra Seestre describes Kim's body as presenting an interplay between a "historic racial dichotomy that positions white bodies as refined and restrained and non-white bodies as overtly sexual, while exploiting the interstices of such taxonomies for profit."

On the reality television show H8r, Kim defends the critics of her body who accuse of her of cultural appropriation. "I'm Armenian," she explains, " You look at my aunts and my cousins, we have that curvy body too, it's not just an African American thing."

This othering of Kim Kardashian's Armenian heritage, however, ignores the complicated intersections and divergences between race and ethnicity.  Armenians, unlike Hispanics (a term that includes a diverse group of people from across the Caribbean, South and Central America) are exclusively labeled caucasian.  As discussed earlier in the analysis of Kim Kardashian's x-rays, Kim's exoticized form carries key signifiers of black beauty standards, while simultaneously taking advantage of the historical privilege offered by whiteness.  Stuart Hall argues that this complicated form of cultural appropriation displaces traditional notions of racism.  He writes, "[t]he play of identity and difference which constructs racism is powered not only by the positioning of blacks as the inferior species but also, at the the same time, by an inexpressible envy and desire [...] imply[ing] a process of identification and otherness which is more complex than we had hitherto imagined."

</p>

<br>

<p>

  In many ways, Kim Kardashian's body reads as hispanic and she adopts the racial ambiguity subscribed to Hispanics in the American media.

   Kardashian's adoption of "racial mobility," a term Precilla Pena Ovalle has deployed to describe Hispanic celebrities treatment of race, suggests a more culturally and politically specific understanding Los Angeles history.  There is a long history in the twentieth century of Blacks and Latinos sharing a cultural space in Los Angeles, beginning with the 1943 Sleepy Lagoon Trial and Zoot Suit riots.  Through Kim's appropriation of black beauty standards through the racial ambiguity of her Armenian body deployed as a Hispanic body, the Kardashian's are unintentionally gesturing to a longer cultural history of bodily aesthetics in twentieth century Los Angeles.  While a fuller understanding of this issue is the beyond the scope of this study, the problematic appropriation of black culture sheds light on the Kardashian's performance of Armenian heritage.
