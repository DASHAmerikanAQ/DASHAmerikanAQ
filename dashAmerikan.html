<h2>II. Hating the Kardashians and the Politics of Taste</h2>
<p>
“When you look at the scary state of this country, it’s insane how things that began as jokes keep going, like the Kardashians. They weren’t supposed to last this long. And now this Trump thing, where everyone said, ‘Oh, he’ll be out, he’ll be out, he’ll be out’ — he’s still not out.”
 <br>
Chelsea Handler, New York Times, April 4, 2016[1]
 <br>
In 2015, Q Scores, the data gathering company that measures the “consumer appeal of personalities, characters, licensed properties, programs and brands,” delivered a report on the nation’s most disliked celebrities.[2] Perhaps unsurprisingly to her many critics, the reality television star and media empress Kim Kardashian ranked the highest negativity rating of any celebrity. Her score beat out such notable competition as serial rapist Bill Cosby, racist celebrity chef Paula Deen, and pop’s perpetual whipping boy, Justin Bieber, all of whom made infamous headlines that year. But the fact that she scored so poorly with viewers did not translate into a fall in popularity for her or her family’s media brand. Q Score Executive Vice President Henry Schafer believed that audiences enjoyed a “love to hate” relationship with Kim and that negativity worked for Kardashian because “That's how she markets herself.”[3]
<br>
This profound dislike for Kim and, by extension, the Kardashian family reflected an odd metric of popularity and taste in general, one certainly echoed by critics of their show Keeping Up with the Kardashians (KUWTK) and reality television in general. Reality TV and its stars have long made easy targets for popular and critical derision. From the drunken fights on the Real Housewives docu-soap franchise to the hixploitation of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and Swamp People, reality television often traffics in heavily-edited narratives, endless recaps, and outsized personalities that blur the line between stereotyping and engaged character development. Journalist and media studies scholar Sherri Williams has commented how “It seems that reality show directors and producers are not looking to cast whole, complete people. They’re casting types, and that leads to stereotyping.”[4] Over the past twenty years or so, networks have offered viewers the chance to watch America’s culture wars play out in the odd-couple pairings of Wife Swap or vicariously fulfill their DIY fantasies on Fixer Upper. Audiences can/should never feel certain that the stories played out before them maintain even the most tangential relationship to reality. Still, it seems network and cable stations have rushed to service an array of niche markets with their choice reality shows, while experts warn of its insidious influence. American popular culture reflects a market structure of an ever-increasing number of outlets for countless programming options, from AMC’s prestige shows like Mad Men to A&E’s Duck Dynasty. In the process, this fracturing of viewing markets has led to TV success on a scale of micropopularity in which the critically acclaimed Breaking Bad can find an audience along with KUWTK, an undoubtedly "lowbrow" production in the taste hierarchy.
<br>
Scholars have weighed in on the alleged pernicious influence of reality television and the Kardashian empire in particular with implication about how bad taste delivers bad consequences. Anecdotally, this year’s Praxis project on the Kardashians has elicited its share of raised eyebrows. While our cohort enjoyed unyielding support from the Scholars’ Lab staff, students of more traditionally “serious” scholarly subjects have shared their confused and patronizing comments about the importance and/or relevance of the topic. They are not alone in their dismissal and feigned concern. Social psychologist Bryan Gibson and his colleagues have concluded that viewing certain reality TV programming like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives increases a viewer’s aggressiveness.[5] Gibson has also gauged reality TV for its effects on the level of narcissism in its viewers. He categorizes KUWTK alongside shows like Real Housewives, The Bachelor, Basketball Wives, and Dance Moms as part of a reality TV trend that encourages self-obsession and the prioritization of appearances in its viewers.[6] An Australian study of reactions to celebrity and peer Instagram images echoes Gibson’s work. This survey of 138 undergraduate women found that exposure to images from celebrities like Kim Kardashian’s Instagram account, as well as images from normatively attractive peers, encouraged an increase in negative feelings about the viewer’s own body image.[7] Whether in the form of reality TV or social media, scholarly judgment fails to find much redeeming substance when it comes to the Kardashian family.
<br>
Other celebrities and pundits have also judged the Kardashians and found them lacking any redeeming content. Cosmopolitan aggregated a list of the 24 “meanest” opinions leveled against the family, with most of the scorn directed at Kim.[8] Comedians Chelsea Handler, Amy Schumer, and David Cross have treated Kim Kardashian like a Botox-filled piñata for their verbal beat downs. Referring to the entire family with characteristic delicacy, Cross conjectured how “They must sit there every day and go, ‘Um, uh, Kim, thank you so much for — remember when you sucked that guy’s dick and taped it and then released it and leaked it? . . . Thank you so much’. . . And it helps having an awful, shallow whore of a mother. That helps as well — to whore out your kids to make money.”[9] Other detractors were less imaginative, if no less subtle. Consider Barbara Walters statement to the family during a 2011 interview: “You don’t have any, forgive me, talent.”[10] Cross, Walters, and even social scientists seem to agree that the Kardashians add nothing to the commonweal and may even give evidence of a severe break in the social fabric.
<br>
At the heart of these judgments lies an indictment of authenticity­ –– an implication that the Kardashians are fake stars pulling a ruse on America. It makes sense that Handler might compare the Kardashians to Trump in this regard. Likewise, Cross and Walters cast the family as pseudo celebrities, pretenders to the throne of stardom who have sacrificed nothing while gaining immense fame and fortune. Cross’s statement even likens their rise to popularity to prostitution. Not only did Kim sell her performance of sex with rap artist Ray J for fame, but in Cross’s view, family matriarch Kris Jenner actively plays the role of madam/pimp, selling her children’s bodies for income. Mad Men star Jon Hamm chimed in as well in 2012, complaining, “Whether it’s Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian or whoever, stupidity is certainly celebrated. Being a fucking idiot is a valuable commodity in this culture because you’re rewarded significantly.”[11] No one needs to have real talent, these commenters imply. Sell your ignorance. Sell your body. Inauthenticity has won. Fake is the new real.
<br>
Oddly enough, these derisive opinions make Hamm and his fellow detractors sound less like employees of the same media-made star system as Kim and the family and more like mid-century cultural critics. In 1939, art critic Clement Greenberg published his seminal essay “Avant Garde and Kitsch” in the Partisan Review, lamenting that society seemed to be trading real art for kitsch. Real art, specifically the avant garde, conveyed authentic expression while kitsch traded in ersatz sentiment and built-in emotional responses. For Greenberg, kitsch included much of what we call pop culture: “popular, commercial art and literature with their chromeotypes, magazine covers, illustrations, ads, slick and pulp fiction, comics, Tin Pan Alley music, tap dancing, Hollywood movies, etc, etc.” In short, kitsch included all mass produced, mass consumed entertainment, which “pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money––­­not even their time.”[12] Like kitsch, the Kardashians seem to lack positive value, a judgment shared among all the opinions and social science data included here. Through their TV show and glamorous social media presence, the Kardashians mass-produce their own images to create an ersatz intimacy with their viewers and fans, turning themselves into mass-market commodities in the process. All the emotion is prepackaged and built-in. Fans must only turn on the television, open a tabloid, or check their Instagram accounts to consume what so many have deemed void of any value.
<br>
Yet such judgments of value are also judgments of taste, and judgments of taste are social judgments. In his study of Céline Dion, Let’s Talk About Love: A Journey to the End of Taste, music critic Carl Wilson explores why people become fans of an artist so patently uncool as Dion. Wilson builds off of Pierre Bourdieu’s Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste, noting that taste judgments are all about establishing boundaries used to distinguish one set of preferences from those deemed to be lower in the social hierarchy. But while Bourdieu drew these conclusions by analyzing the way taste corresponds to economic class, Wilson remains more interested in the cultural capital of “coolness” than any strict economic approach. He understands that holding cultural capital does not correlate to economic class, a fact evidenced by the middling incomes of taste-making, pop music writers (himself included).[13]
<br>
Being cool does not always pay well, but at least it delivers the cultural capital of top-tier taste distinctions and with it, a sense of superiority based on what one does not consume. You read The Paris Review, not US Weekly. You watch Girls, not KUWTK. Yet the demographics with the most cultural capital may even engage in ironic consumption of “bad” art or entertainment. As Wilson writes, “Having a ‘guilty pleasure,’ for instance, can be an asset in this system of cultural capital because it suggests that you are so cool that you can afford to risk it on something goofy, ungainly and awkward––which makes you that much cooler.”[14] So, maybe you do watch KUWTK, but you do so by “hate watching” as suggested by those Q Score findings. The Kardashians are worthless for so many critics because they hold no cultural capital, no symbolic power. They embody inauthenticity. They are all easy money and no taste. The only way to enjoy them and maintain credibility is by distancing oneself through ironic detachment if you want to maintain a place above them in the hierarchy of taste.
<br>
But not everyone who keeps up with the Kardashians is “hate watching.” And if the Kardashians are so vacuous and inauthentic, then what does it mean for someone to enjoy them genuinely? To answer these questions, our work digs past the superficial critiques of the Kardashian family’s rise to fame, their ostensibly valueless presence, and their perceived negative influence on society to analyze the content and context of their media empire. What might we find if we take seriously the idea the Kardashians might be engaged in positive emotional labor for the people who actually identify with them and their image? And what does it say about the harshest critics if they can so easily categorize the Kardashians and, by extension, their sincerest fans as valueless? Through the digital humanities methods outlined below, DASH-Amerikan uncovers the actual content of Kardashian media ecology to work past the easy critiques of, perhaps, the most famous and polarizing family in the United States.
</p>
<br>
<h2> III. Historical Context of Celebrity, Marketing and Performative Promotion</h2>
<br>
<p>
<br>
Kim Kardashian has been noted as a trailblazer in the utilization of 21st century social media technologies for self-promotion, is a consistent practitioner of the “selfie,” and maintains a steady devotion to Instagram and other social media for the promotion of her personal brand and reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  Millions of fans “keep up” with the Kardashian brand through social media, celebrity tabloids, and “entertainment” sections of news websites.  The Kardashian empire has encouraged, to a large extent, fan interactivity with the digital brand— Kim Kardashian has over 50 million followers on Twitter and Instagram, which for many creates a personal sense of connection to the Kardashians. The show itself has a strong presence on social media, and fans are encouraged to download and use the “cellphone apps” created by Kim and her sisters.
<br>
What is the nature of this celebrity interactivity? Does interaction with celebrities through social media provide users with a hope that some element of stardom will somehow brush off onto them?  Joshua Gamson wonders whether modern conceptions of fame offer a kind of “pseudo-participation,” where fans may believe that stardom is not only accessible to celebrities, but to themselves as well.[3]  This question of “pseudo-participation” is particularly relevant in the era of Twitter and Instagram, which encourage fan interaction with stars.  How authentic, however, is this interaction?  In Marwick and Boyd’s study of celebrity Twitter accounts, “From a sample of 144 highly followed accounts, we determined that 105 were written by individual famous people, 7 by a team (publicists, assistants, and so on), 11 by a team plus the celebrity, and 21 were indeterminate.”[4]  However, the platform itself does not make it possible to determine precisely with whom one is interacting when one contacts a “celebrity.” When today, marketing with hashtags and crowd interaction are intertwined with the very cultural production itself—the consumers, along with the producers are “performing the production,” and further reinforcing the Kardashian brand.
<br>
The status of the Kardashian brand in contemporary American society is impossible to understand without looking back to celebrity and marketing in the 20th century and before, and how modern celebrity practice was influenced by changes in technology and the expansion of the entertainment industry. [6] Promotion of celebrity status through performative practice has existed since the very notion of celebrity itself, and our modern understanding of celebrity according to Fred Inglis’ A Short History of Celebrity dates to the mid-1700s.  Inglis sees a great difference between modern fame spectacles and pre-modern ceremonies.  He notes the distinction between of the Royal Progresses of Elizabeth II and modern spectacles of celebrity, which he states as having emerged in the mid-18th century.[1] Within the context of the development of late-18th century industrialization, marketing and promotional activities vastly expanded in order to reach consumers, with individual entrepreneurs and companies employing varied methods of promotion.  While print marketing was commonplace, novel promotional techniques were experimented with in the 19th century— Joshua Gamson notes some of the earliest examples of celebrity promotion, and draws attention to the unique marketing practices in P. T. Barnum’s performative stunts of the late 19th century.[2] In the 21st century, marketing practices have perhaps taken a page out of Barnum’s book, and become increasingly performative with the encouragement of brand engagement through a variety of social media platforms.
<br>
Media reproduction and the photographic and video technology changed the very nature of media itself in the 20th century, as noted by critics like Walter Benjamin and Leo Lowenthal. Benjamin saw the capabilities of image reproduction to be a watershed moment that overturned prior understanding of the nature of images themselves, and had vital ramifications for the worlds of art, media, and marketing.  Constant image reproduction, in Benjamin’s view, led to the loss of an “aura” inherent in pre-technological reproduction of images.[5]
<br>
Frankfurt School critic, Leo Lowenthal, noted the changing nature of celebrity in the essay “The Triumph of Mass Idols,” (1944) in which he compared literary biographies of the 1900s and 1910s to those of the 1920s and 1930s.  Lowenthal’s finding is that the more recent biographies are focused on stars produced for mass-consumption, heralding a new of type of celebrity whose image is more vital than the actual things that they create or produce.[6] The post-WWII era saw a new phase in the refinement of marketing for the promotion of commodities.  Indeed, Margaret Mead noted in 1956 “There is not a culture of America, but a culture of Madison Avenue.”[7]  In this era celebrity and marketing meshed together in a way that blurred the edges between celebrity and marketing. The idea of people who are “famous for being famous” came into existence with Daniel Boorstin’s (1961) take on the state of American culture in The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, where Boorstin notably proclaimed celebrities as “human pseudo-events.”[8] Are the Kardashian merely a continuation of Boorstin’s observation, but with the utilization of new technologies? Are we simply experiencing spectacles and “pseudo-events” through new mediums?
<br>
It could be said that the public is drawn to the artificial, surface-level aspects of the Kardashian media machine.  However, beyond the promotional, profit-oriented aspects of celebrity marketing promotion, do we see genuine concerns in the Kardashian marketing machine? Especially with the utilization of social media in mind, can bits of actual authenticity exist interlaced within a constructed illusion of authenticity?  Our corpus of tweets revealed activism for recognition of the Armenian geocide and other socially focused goals.  Thus, in their media ecologies, the Kardashian are neither purely promotional nor purely authentic.  The same platforms are used for multiple purposes in the Kardashian media landscape, whether they are profit-oriented or otherwise. In 2015, the series premieres of Keeping Up with the Kardashians outperformed the final season of the critically-acclaimed AMC show Mad Men. Somewhat ironically, is there a bridge between the Kardashians and the mid-century advertising executives of Madison Avenue? Has what Margaret Mead called the “culture of Madison Avenue” in 2017 been supplanted by the “culture of the smartphone, the selfie, and the hashtag”?  As one of the of the most successful self-promoters using these technologies, does Kim Kardashian have an instinctive feel for marketing and self-promotion in contemporary American culture that makes her more like Don Draper than anyone would have ever suspected?

<h2>Fanfiction, Fan Response, and Adoption</h2>

<div id= "foot-n3" class="footnotebox">

  <h5>Fanfiction is generally unpublished in a traditional sense, being primarily shared on the Internet, and before that in science fiction zines, however the bestselling Fifty Shades of Grey series was originally a piece of fanfiction. Karen Hellekson and Kristina Busse, <i>The Fanfiction Studies Reader</i>.</h5>
</div>
<p>
  At several moments during the project we’ve inquired whether the kinds of conversations we've seen in the media presented by the personal and corporate entities of the Kardashians are conversations that are shared by their followers and fans. In order to identify and possibly understand conversational through-lines, the Karshashian's convergence culture, we thought we might look to some of the most engaged Kardashian fans—fanfiction writers. Since the late nineties, scholars have been studying the cultural phenomena of fan fiction, or the fannish practice of writing fiction using the characters and the worlds of beloved books, television shows, movies, and, etc.<a class="footnote" id="n3">3</a>  Fanfiction gives us even more ideas about the establishment of a Kardashian cultural community as well as the possible reification and rejection of particular discourses surrounding Kardashian celebrity. Or, what, if anything, are Kardashian fans producing in their position within the Kardashian media ecology?
</p>
<p>
  The digital writing platform Wattpad provides a new community of young amateur writers to consider and interrogate. Unlike other fanfiction communities and archives, writers of Kardashian fanfiction produce most frequently on Wattpad. And it is interesting to note that these writers are young, generally teenaged. Unlike other popular fan fiction archives Wattpad operates on popularity metrics of "most viewed" and  often publishes their popular author's <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/imagines-celebrity-encounters-starring-you-preview/">finished work</a>. The writers' choice of archive and its potential for monetization (Wattpad writer Anna Todd made a six-figure deal for her popular One Direction fanfiction in 2015) is particularly interesting when read through the lens of the Kardashians who always monetize the personal and the amateur. <a class="footnote" id="n4">4</a>

<p>
  In the tradition of fan fiction studies, we used fanfiction works, especially metadata, as a place to further interrogate the producer-consumer relations of the Kardashians and their audience. In order to begin sifting through this writing community, we built a scraping tool what collected metadata from stories that were tagged indicating they were about the Kardashians. Part of the tradition of fan fiction is a practice of generating effusive and specific tags and descriptions for stories. Thus, it seems potentially more interesting to see how authors not only are writing but also theorizing their own stories. What might we find in collective meta-engagement with individual works?
</p>
<p>
  At first look, the themes within the canon of of Kardashian fanfiction seem to stick to two major tropes: a) the narrator finds she is a missing Kardashian sister and is rescued(!) from obscurity, or b) the narrator is adopted by a Kardashian or Jenner sister. The final scenario is decidedly a "group text" genre in which the writer is imagining what might happen in celebrity group chat. These stories generally feature Kylie and Kendall.
  It's notable that these narratives misalign with the trends of a majority of fanfiction, the romantic male-driven slash story. [add a link from dailydot]. In fact, without strong tragic narratives in need of "fixing" or male leads to transform into lovers, the Kardashian fandom manages to turn most fanfiction writing practices on their heads.

<p>Wattpad Modelling (20 Topics)<iframe width="600" height="400" src="/Users/alyssadcollins/Documents/Praxis/dash-american/WattpadTopics2.png" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p></div>
<p>
  When we turn to topic modeling of the descriptions we see these themes of adoption and communication solidify anew. At 20 topics, relationships, especially familial, present themselves throughout. These themes become especially apparent looking at topics 4, 5, 6, and 8 (which can be found in the modal window above). The topics of fame and family are interspersed throughout, and we see the alignment of Kardashian interest and response to it by fans. The same goes for topics of celebrity and their close ties to family or friendship. The concept of narrative ("story," "reading," "books," "writing") pops up across topics.  We see the the influence of not only the act of writing, but also the ways in which the Kardashians fashion themselves as particular kinds of story-tellers (as reality tv personalities, producers of said show, and general content producers).  Thus the themes of the show, family, legacy, matriarchy, are mostly reified through their writing fan base.
</p>

<p>
  What we don't see in these fan interactions is the critique that often accompanies transformative fannish writing and fan response. We don't even see the mild interrogations of the tabloid writer or the sharp, quick-witted commentary of the twitter community. For these fanfiction writers, to keep up with the Kardashians is to love them, to insert themselves fully into their lives, to be recognized and accepted within the Kardashian matriarchal lineage.<a class="footnote" id="n5">5</a>

  <h5>For those of you who are in the (fanfiction) know, we might think about how these stories begin to reveal a  different kind of Mary Sue, one who doesn't save the day, or get the love interest but instead gets a new celebrity family.</h5>
