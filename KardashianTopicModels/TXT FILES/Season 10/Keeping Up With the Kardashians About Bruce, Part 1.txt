- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the first time I've ever spoken about Bruce, ever, to other people besides my sisters. Are you planning on not being Bruce anytime soon? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sometimes it's easier to talk to people you don't know about this issue than it is to your kids. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I just don't like when people say Bruce is gonna be gone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Most of the people I've ever told about it, they're in shock. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We would find things like makeup, and we thought he was having an affair. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We were, like, scared to ask him about it. So we kind of just, like, put it off. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce was dressed up like a woman. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's hard for me to just believe it's happening. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you gonna fully become a woman? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Um... &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause you never told me that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a tough transition for the people around you. You're the ones that I all love and adore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Obviously not, if you keep lying to us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not lying, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You were! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's time for me to deal with myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just live the happiest life you can live. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Doing this publicly... I want to help people. Maybe this is my greatest calling in life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's pretty wild that you're gonna live two lives in one lifetime. Bruce is gonna open the door for so many people. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm very optimistic about the future. And I haven't felt that way in a long, long time. Are you ready? Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are those? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got Bruce a present. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, that's his size? A 13? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He said he was a 13M. Which I don't know what "M" is. Here's one. &gt;&gt; KIM: Those are cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He said he doesn't have enough-- she doesn't have a lot of shoes. Coming in and doing this interview, it's... I do have high anxiety. I don't know if I'm gonna cry, laugh awkwardly, or... I don't know if I'm saying the right thing, if I'm using the right terminology, if I'm offending somebody. I'm not trying to do any of that, but I'm also digesting things as I receive them and I'm also... This is my first time going through something like this. I am fine with him dressing as a woman, and I want Bruce to be happy. Bruiser? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whew! That is a hike. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: In torn-up jeans, oh, my God! I love you. What is this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your gravel is not good for high heels. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it's not good. I'm sorry. What is this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got you some prezzies. Oh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are those from you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Now, I don't know her taste yet, so I'm trying to figure that out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, to be honest with you, I don't know her taste, either, so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, you don't? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. But do you know how nice this is? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, without even opening them. Do you know how nice this is? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw. Well, Brucey... you deserve it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And how much I appreciate this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, good. You deserve it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Since I can remember, when I was a little kid, um, my gender identity was always an issue. People don't see that on the outside. They don't know the struggle on the inside. And so I just literally ran away from it. I could be this male, macho guy, you know, and prove to the world your manhood and... you go out there and kick the world's butt. The last person in the world you would ever think would have, you know, problems like this... Bango! Here I am, Mr. Macho, dealing with gender identity issues. My little secret that I wouldn't tell anybody. I've been holding her off all my life. Push her away, push her away, push her away. This is so much fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So much fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And look! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They are the same! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're twins. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Those are very cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Try yours on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you really want me to try them on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I want to see if it fits, or else we have to get new ones. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. Mm-hmm. One second. Ah. There we go. They fit! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! Who wore it better? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who wore it...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bitch stole my look. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You are so sweet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yay! I'm so happy you like. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Give me a hug, baby. Give me a hug. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi, baby. How's my baby? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you feeling better now that more people know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When you keep a secret for all your life and never have an opportunity to talk about it, to deal with it, you have no idea how tough it is on you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's the day, Kendall? Why is this day special? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fourth of July. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The Fourth of July. I remember being a kid and not knowing what was going on. Oh, my God, why are you... I can't... Um... I just remember being little and not really knowing what was going on. And, um... we would find things like makeup or, like, lipstick, and we thought he was having an affair at one point, and we didn't know what to do. We didn't want our family to be broken up, so we wouldn't tell anybody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When Kourtney and Kim found out, it's because Kimberly walked in on Bruce. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just came home, and I walked in the garage to go to my bedroom, and Bruce was dressed up... like a woman. I ran to Kourtney's, and I was hysterical, crying. We have no idea what this is or what this means. So I kept the secret for maybe, you know, 12 years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I found out, when he did his appearances, that he would get dressed and walk the lobby of his hotel, 'cause he felt so good that he could do that and no one knew it was him. And I remember I would just be so scared, like, what if someone catches him? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I ran into him at this house, actually. Like, a year ago, I remember. He doesn't even know. He has no idea. I was going to get water downstairs-- at 4:00 a.m., I woke up to go get water, and I walked down the stairs, came to the kitchen, got my water. He was coming down, and I saw him-- I was coming from the kitchen. Thank God he turned right and went through the middle of the stairs instead of turning left, 'cause we would've bumped right into each other. I just backed up and he walked through the middle, and then I ran up the stairs quietly and I went to bed. I just feel bad. Like, if that's really what makes you happy, then... you had to sneak around at, like, 4:00 a.m. because you didn't want to, like, scare me and Kylie? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And Kourtney, Kim and I never said a word, not even to my mom, 'cause we never wanted to make my mother feel uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I imagine Bruce is so relieved to have told us this that he might not understand the full effect. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He told me about four months ago. He told all the kids separately and alone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think I've ever been as scared... uh, in my life as I was to be... extraordinarily honest with my kids. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He asked me to come over his house one day. And then he sat me down and he... he told me... he told me everything. I just felt like he felt, like, comfortable telling me or something. And, like, that made me feel... I'm, like, can't even get anything out, and, um... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He was very emotional when talking to me about it. Um, I remember he was crying and just... I think his biggest concern is he doesn't want to hurt us. I still feel like he hasn't really decided exactly what he's going to do. He just doesn't really have an answer, and maybe he doesn't know the answer, which is fine. I think he's kind of taking it as it goes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: At this point in my life, this is kind of my thing. This is... what I want to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you... and I don't know if this is, like, too deep. Are you planning on not being Bruce anytime soon? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, that's quite possible, yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, it's something that we all need to know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think you could just say that's quite... Like, you have children. You don't need our permission, but you need to tell us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've already talked to all my kids and told you what I was going through. I thought it was pretty much understood. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you understand that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-mm. I didn't know that. You didn't make that part clear. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You definitely withhold information. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My sisters and I knew from whenever we found out years ago that... Bruce was a cross-dresser, but we were never told that he was gonna fully transition and become a woman. So, when is Bruce gonna be gone? Do you have a timeframe? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Probably in the spring. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This spring? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Bruce is gonna be gone within the next, like, four to five months? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't care that you want to do it. I support you. I've always supported you. But I don't think it's fair that you don't tell us how close this is in the near future. We're still your kids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't care that you want to do it. I support you. I've always supported you. But I don't think it's fair that you don't tell us how close this is in the near future. We're still your kids. I don't care how old I am. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everybody you talk to about this subject-- especially when they're that close-- you get a different reaction. There's so many different things that they're dealing with, you know? Sometimes it's really tougher for them than it is for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And don't you think we're scared? We all have emotions. And I'm not gonna feel like I'm not allowed to be honest with you about my feelings, 'cause that's not fair for you to do to us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I agree. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This entire process, I think no matter how honest Bruce is with us, for me, it's just something that will take time in digesting and getting used to. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm gonna get a tissue. He's the most amazing person I know. I couldn't ask for a better dad. Like... He taught me how to ride a bike and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa, it's a big turn! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ...be the tomboy that I am and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How did you turn? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Every single day, we went to school 45 minutes away from home. He would drive us to school. He'd be the first one in the line to pick us up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here comes our kids. They're so excited about the first day of school. Here's Kimberly. Yes, bebopping around. Our teenager. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shotgun! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce was the greatest stepdad, because he treated my kids like they were his own. &gt;&gt; KIM: Please do not film me. Do not film me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Isn't she the cutest? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She is. There's been so many memories shared and so many... different... amazing times with our kids and our family. Here's my crazy husband. Honey, this is the only time. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm doing it next. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's jump together. Are you ready? One, two, three, go! &gt;&gt; KIM: We were so excited to have Bruce in our lives. He was just so much fun. And I just remember he would sit up and tell us, like, stories at night, and he really promised my dad that he would be there for us unconditionally. And he really has, you know, held up his end of the bargain. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce has been my dad since I've been four years old. I've lived with him every single day since I've been four. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe's here. Say hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He's a person that knows everything... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stick with Daddy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...so he always has the answers to everything. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And there's my little Kylie. Whatever happens, I always want you to know that Daddy loves you and that I think you're just a wonderful little girl and could I have a kiss? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I just don't like when people say Bruce is gonna be gone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, it's not fair. Like, for you not to tell your kids this It's just not okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One of the most difficult things in talking to your child and trying to keep your relationship with your child very strong for me is honesty about the severity of what's happening right now. Sometimes it's easier to talk to people you don't know about this issue than it is to your kids. I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We love you... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not going anywhere. You know, it's like, all of a sudden, you're getting this feeling like I'm abandoning you. I'm not abandoning anybody. I apologize if I didn't communicate good enough. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think it's just scary when someone says that Bruce is gonna be gone and you're not gonna not gonna be like you anymore. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I never said Bruce is gonna be gone. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know, but you just make it feel that way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You guys said it. I'm not going anywhere. I'm still going to be here for you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but it's not the same... Yes, and I know you are. I will never... I... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And probably be closer to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We want you to do what makes you happy. We all do and we're gonna support you and be there for you, but you have to be honest with us, even if it hurts you. 'Cause it's going to hurt all of us, but this hurts us more. Like, us feeling like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, her and Kylie are the only ones that I'm really concerned about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I think about this whole thing, I consider my emotions just as important as Kendall or Kylie's. I've known Bruce, like, longer than K-Kendall and Kylie have, if you want to, like, put it out there. Yes, we're not blood, but it's... I don't know. It's still my dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think we're all passionate and emotional. And I think I'm pretty damn close with you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I agree. It's very difficult. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you're so concerned, shouldn't her and Kylie have the opportunity to say good-bye? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But I'm not going anywhere. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not the same person. You even said yourself, "I'm way more fun when I'm her." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Dealing with something like this-- and I get it-- is dealing, like, with a death in the family. You don't look like him anymore. You somewhat act like him, but not really. It's a tough transition for the people around you. Once they get through that... break through that whole thing and say, "You know what? The world's not collapsing. Let's move on with life." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think we all need to have a sit-down, and you have to be willing to answer these questions no matter how draining it might be. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, let's set up a time... next couple of days. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We should. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, as a young, young boy, you know-- seven, eight, nine, ten-- I knew something wasn't right, but I never really had a chance to express it. And so the few times I had where I had the opportunity to, you know, steal some of my mom's clothes, my sister's clothes, this and that, uh, you know, I just went for it. I liked that side of me. But it also scared me to death. Scared me to death. Oh, my God, what do I do here? You know, everybody thinks I got to be this boy, when you don't know if you feel that way, so I'm just gonna show them all. As a young person, you're just totally confused with no help. These are my issues that I have to deal with on my own. And you figure someday you're gonna get over it. So my whole life, I've used distractions. Certainly the games were the biggest distraction from who I am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I met him on a blind date, and it was kind of love at first sight. Within the next five months, we were walking down the aisle. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: I declare that Bruce and Kris are now husband and wife. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We had so much in common that it was kind of a match made in heaven. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look up, look up! Look at the camera! You think this is bad, wait till in 20 years we get a picture of us and all the grandkids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We went to races. We played golf. We went snow skiing. I mean, there wasn't anything we didn't do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Keep your out for traffic. Your job is out here to look for traffic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we could not keep our hands off each other. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A romantic kiss for my beautiful pregnant wife. On our property. I love those times. You know, Kris is a really good woman, and I love her to death. And the love and acceptance I have gotten from Kris is absolutely overwhelming. &gt;&gt; KIM: You look good, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. Thank you. So do you. You always look good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. Your house looks nice, with the flowers and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got the flowers going, we got the whole thing working. We got to take care of the old house. &gt;&gt; KIM: It looks really nice. I'm impressed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. You know, I'm in escrow on the other place. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I heard. I heard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So I'm very excited. Hopefully, in the next three weeks or so, be out of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, that's amazing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, very excited about it. Well, I hope tonight goes better than last night. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? What happened last night? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, you-you prob... I'm sure you heard-- Khloe must have talked to you or... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I didn't. I haven't talked to her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall talked to you? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They ganged up on me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? What did they say? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It felt like last night, if I just didn't communicate good enough with them. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe was just like, you know, "What are you doing? How can you do this? You have to tell us everything. How can other people know and I don't know? This is family." Got Kendall all riled up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Bruce is afraid to let us down. He raised us, you know? He's been in our life for 25 years. We want to understand his struggle. We want to learn about it. We want to relate to it in some way. I think we know you well enough to know that you don't want to hurt us. Like, that's not even a concern of ours. I think what just hurts us is when we hear things are changing and happening, and we don't know about it. We just want to be in the loop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Well, that's... I-I... &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I think we just feel like, "Oh..." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's-it's... I've had secrets all my life. It's tough not to have secrets. You see. I always do my... See? &gt;&gt; KIM: Your feet are actually way more feminine than I ever would have imagined. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am impressed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, no, actually, they come out pretty good. And I do it all myself, um... &gt;&gt; KIM: You do that yourself? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, I do all my nails myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Actually, I do very good in the makeup department. I could do your makeup. I can do it all, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am really shocked at your toes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I-I can do it all. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, shocked. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See, I did Khloe's toes one time, she's going, "Oh, yeah, I get my toes..." And I said, "I'll do your toes for you." She said, "Oh, no way." I said, "I'll do it." So I did her toes for her. And she goes, "How the hell do you know this?" But honestly, I would... &gt;&gt; KIM: That literally looks like a professional did that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, thank you. I would always, even when I was at the house, I would always just wear socks. There's just little things you can do that make you feel a little bit better about yourself. I'm so tired of lying. About my life, about who I am, about everything. It's just like, after a while, it just kind of wears your ass out, you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just want to be honest, no matter what happens in the future. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yep. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know? &gt;&gt; KIM: So do you... are you gonna fully become a woman? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Um... &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause you never told me that, but I've heard it. It's been, like, the rumor. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm... yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: See, you're hesitating. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I see myself in the future that way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: So if when you're talking to Mom... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and the girls... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...you have to say that, and you can't hesitate. Hesitating four seconds makes us feel like you're lying. When you already know the answer. You've probably already made the appointment, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have? You said in the future, like it was, like, in, like, five years. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, happening, like, this year. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, yeah, probably. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. A few more things, uh, mostly with your face. Um... a few more little tweaks, and then I'm kind of done with that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And, you know, we got the Diane Sawyer thing coming. That's gonna happen in a couple of weeks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, really? I didn't know that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: What Diane Sawyer thing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Diane Sawyer-- she wanted to do the interview. &gt;&gt; KIM: And say what? Just, like, everything? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's amazing. It's been kind of my job to keep this secret for over a decade that I just... you know, it's gonna take me a minute to still get out of secret mode, but once he actually comes out, I think people will be accepting... and... you know, give him a platform to be able to tell his story that might help other people that are struggling with the same thing. When is it gonna air? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am shooting it in two weeks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't let the stupid tabloids, you know, out there controlling your message. &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Um... and to be able to do it sensitively and understanding and with tremendous respect for my family... I'm not doing it for ratings or anything like that. I'm trying to do it 'cause I think it's the right thing to do right now in my life. I think you know everything. Thank you for coming out. Having your love and support is by far the most important thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I got you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it's confusing for us. We want to be respectful to Bruce. When does it start that Bruce is now not Bruce and he is a she? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: At this point in my life, yes, I am planning on moving forward. I've pushed the her side off all my life. I can't die and not experience her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is she like Bruce? Do they act the same but she's just a woman? I really don't know how this works. I don't know what to expect. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's hard for me to just... really believe it's happening. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? How'd it go? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, it went good. He basically said, like, a lot of things that he hadn't said before. I didn't know he was, like, really having a transformation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I asked him point-blank, I said, "What are you doing? Are you transitioning?" "I don't know. I haven't really decided." &gt;&gt; KIM: Trust me, I get it. But I want to support him, and I think that... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, yeah, you want to support him, I want him to be happy, but my biggest... : just my biggest concern is that you guys are okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's like, I am... I'm not okay. I don't know how to handle this. You know, like, this is my life, I committed to this life, and I think that he just... checked out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just, it's hard to wrap my head around, because why now? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know this is the dumbest comparison, but it's like... a slight sliver of how he must feel. When I was pregnant, I so not felt like I was in my body. Like, I literally felt like, "Who is this roly-poly..." Like, I couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't wipe myself. That was just for less than a year. He has to deal with this for his entire life, waking up and feeling like, "Whoa, this isn't my body. This doesn't feel comfortable." That's the only way I can kind of imagine it, and you really have to, like, let go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He'd said he had tendencies like that, but that, you know, that wasn't any, that wasn't even a discussion that he would end his life up like this. I never expected that. Not in a million years. I think everybody in life has issues about something, and I'm pretty open to people and their differences. That's what I bring to the table when I'm in a relationship, but the other thing I expect out of a relationship is honesty. I have these memories of this life, and I feel sometimes like it didn't exist. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This dog is, like, crazy. You need to chill. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you knew about Diane Sawyer? &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't know until he blurted it out yesterday, but they have a meeting on Tuesday that he called me and was like, "Hey, I would like you to be in it. You can be, like, the family representative. I feel like I can communicate with you the best." As supportive as I am for Bruce, I do get really protective of my mom. Sometimes I'm totally strong and I'm fine and I can talk to Bruce and really be happy for him, but there's times when I get angry. There's times when I get, you know, resentful and I feel, you know, just really sad for my mom. And at first, I was like, "Wait, what? Diane Sawyer? W-What are you talking about?" &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, I had no idea he was doing Diane Sawyer. Is that really happening? &gt;&gt; KIM: Let me talk to Kendall and Kylie. I love you. I'll call you from the car. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, Dad has this publicist that he had that was his publicist in the '80s. This story almost came out. I don't know if you guys know this, but someone caught him traveling, that had wigs and stuff in his suitcase, and Bruce hired a publicist in the '80s. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Years ago this happened? &gt;&gt; KIM: In the '80s, yeah. And they went to his house, this reporter, and said, "Please don't do this story." And the reporter said, "Fine." Media back then was, like, totally different. No one ever found out. So this is the same publicist that's known everything. He said, "You have to be taken seriously." If he does it with a serious person, it really gives him some legitimacy. So Diane Sawyer-- she's coming to do this special, and they start filming it in two weeks. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why wouldn't he tell us that the night before when we were with him? We just, we had a full argument-- me, him and Khloe-- about the whole thing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What was the argument? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: About him not telling us things. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I mean, I do have concerns about my dad wanting to tell the world. People attacking him and stuff. But I want him to tell everybody. People just wonder. It's the same thing with me, you know? Like, now that I've been told the truth, I can move on and get past it. People know, so now they can accept it-- or not-- and they can move on. &gt;&gt; KIM: He is gonna tell his full story. At first, I was like, "I'm totally gonna cry, I'm totally gonna cry." Like, my throat was, like, literally, like, burning. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: During the interview? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just, no, talking to him, 'cause I was, like, thinking, Mom, this is really hard for her, and, like, it's so sad. Like, she cries all the time, and it, like, makes me really sad, but we should really appreciate all the things that she does for us, 'cause she does a lot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, this is really hard for her, and, like, it's so sad. Like, she cries all the time, and it, like, makes me really sad, but we should really appreciate all the things that she does for us, 'cause she does a lot. I wanted to say this to him yesterday, and I just didn't want to cry, 'cause I felt like he-he had this, like, respect for me, and I was, like, being really strong and, like, he wants me at this meeting, and I'll be the family representative and, like, go there so he doesn't feel like he can't not tell us things, you know? Imagine, this is so emotional for him that he has to call Mom, Kendall, Kylie, and he has to call all of us separately, 'cause we're all busy doing our own things. You know, so I'll totally do that, and I can be calm, and, like, I don't want to cry in front of him. I want to be, like, you know, let him know that it's fine. As uncomfortable and as much as, like, I really, truly can't understand what is in Bruce's mind, you still have to, you know, respect it and support it and just support his decision on wanting to go through this journey. You know, I was, like, so afraid of how I was gonna tell Kanye, but he was like, "You know what, he needs to be who he is and be happy, and everyone around you just support him." So I think people definitely accept it a lot more. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, and I honestly think it could be a good thing in the long run. Like, he could do so much with it. His motivational speeches-- that will be so different and amazing for him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally, but there will... I want everyone to be prepared that there might be a weird period that makes everyone uncomfortable. You know, 'cause other people can't even begin to understand it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Whatever people are gonna think, that-that's not even part of it at all. I'm more worried about how people are gonna, like, treat him. I don't ever want anyone to treat him bad, because he is, honestly, one of the greatest people I know. He wouldn't hurt a fly. So to think of someone... giving him hate or... like, not being okay with who he wants to be and who makes him happy, that-that scares me, and that's more of a worry to me than anything else. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Where are your other snacks? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just for you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Top Ramens, baby. This may never happen again. Let me get a picture of you in the kitchen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You should take pictures with your dad, FYI. Better take a lot with him. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want Bruce to do what's best for him. I just wish, like, you couldn't have given us a little more time to, like, hang out with you some more or get any time during, like, the transition time? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here comes Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My long-lost sister who doesn't text back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's not texting you back? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Never. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The last time we talked, you said we have to get everybody together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, where do you want to start? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I think we should start with Kendall and I came here to see Bruce, and Kendall and I found out a lot's happening, and Bruce is under the impression that he's told all of us everything. We had to find out that Bruce is fully transitioning in spring. He claims that he told us all of this, and that's what I'm pissed about. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've never heard that, for sure. I just think if you are doing a huge thing like that, you know, that we should know and be... prepare ourselves. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think the whole thing is we don't ever want you to feel ganged up on, especially not from us, and it may sometimes come off as, like, aggressive or, like, we're yelling at you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think it was aggressive. I think there were legit questions that we... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think they were, too, completely, but I'm saying if it does come off as that, it's only because this is not something that we're used to. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think we just, I mean, first and foremost, we all support your decision. Khloe's method of dealing with things is just a little bit more harsh than, you know, the others. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I just want honesty; just keep it honest. I've always been team Bruce. Always been on your side. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe, Khloe, Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks for calling me after I left your house. I haven't spoke to you since when I left in tears. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You didn't call me, either. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why should I? You're the one who was lying to me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not lying, Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You were until we got it out of you! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't tell you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't lie. I didn't say I wasn't doing this or I wasn't... I just never told you anything. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You made it seem like maybe it was a far in the future thing... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not an easy subject to talk to you about. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I completely understand that and I get that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think we all want to be on the same page with you. We all want to support you and we all want to hear from you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's why we're here talking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to offend anybody, especially Bruce. That's the last thing I want to do. Bruce has carpooled us, soccer dad, every single day since I've been four. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe's in! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He walked me down my aisle at my wedding. He's been an incredible father to all of us. So, yeah, I totally respect that it's difficult, but I don't know. I really only have gotten mad when I found out things that weren't what he told me. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have to, like, let it out, because even if we didn't understand it and even if some of us are confused and some of us have questions, we just want to feel comfortable that we can ask you those questions and talk to you and be a part of this journey with you, because we feel a disconnect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When you carry around a secret your whole life, what you have a tendency to do is you isolate yourself from the world. I've done a lot of that. That's not a good thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So do you have, like, a date? Is it, like, a whole major thing? Like, I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a lot of work. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Kay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, you do it in stages. You probably didn't even notice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You got a nose job. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I noticed. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I noticed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it's still pretty swollen. It'll-it'll get better. It's still a little swollen right there. But, anyway, he did my nose and a little what they call upper lip lift. Then they do the forehead. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Guys have, like, a little ridge right here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I had no idea. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And they go in, actually, and take it down and then lower your hairline down a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: These are very premeditated operations. They're not anything that you decide on the whim. From what I read online, you have to be on hormones and estrogen and whatever, you have to go see a therapist to fully transition, and the therapist and the doctor have to, like, agree together. If that's true, you've been doing these therapy sessions for how long? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And then they also do the jawline. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What are you gonna do with the jaw? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, they just trim it down here so it's not quite as harsh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you do that all at one time? This and this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Those things will be done at the same time, yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God, are you not scared for that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Everybody you talk to about this subject, you get a different reaction. You know, am I doing the right thing? Honestly, I just don't want to hurt the... I don't want to hurt anybody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. In dealing with this and coming out with this issue, what is your biggest concern? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to make a change, I'm all for you doing that, but I'm afraid, what if you do all of this-- not just even privately-- you do it so publicly so there's no turning back? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I do feel like he's gone through this his whole life. I feel like you have to be somewhat pretty certain. It's 65 years later. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah, I'm very certain. That's... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, he's certain he wants to do it... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But doing it publicly is extraordinarily difficult. In the position that I'm in, I have a big stage that I'm on, okay? And maybe with that stage, I can do something. After all the things I've done in my life-- the games, the families, the business, the this, the that-- maybe this is my greatest calling in life. You know, be honest to myself and be honest to my family, be honest to my friends, and then maybe in that honesty, I can help other people. I mean, I go out, I got friends, I do a very good job of... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You go out? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have been out, yes. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Where? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, to the movies, done that. Nobody knows. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's your casual style like? Is it, like, a denim-on-denim or is it like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, not denim-on-denim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...or is it, like, a skirt and a...? &gt;&gt; KIM: Whose style, out of all of us, are you most like? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, actually, I have quite a bit of clothes and, uh... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But, like, what's your everyday kind of style? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love good old jeans and, uh, you know, a great sweater, stuff like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you wear a wig or is this just the hair that you go for? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh... I have had wigs. I mean, the worst days of my life are the days I've had to get my hair cut. The haircuts for me have been the most traumatic things in life. Want to keep it long in the front, 'cause I like wearing it in a ponytail, and if you get it too short in the front, you can't... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, so we're not getting rid of the ponytail? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, we're not getting rid of the ponytail. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you gonna cry? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like you're really... like, this is hard for you to let go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't take that, okay? I want my hair to be longer, but society says I've got to cut my hair 'cause you're a guy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Since you're gonna be in the wedding, my number one goal would be cut the hair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know how long it takes for your hair to grow back? It's taken me a year, year and a half to get this length! Getting my hair cut-- does it look better on Bruce? Yes. But it doesn't look better on my soul, you know? It's just little things like that, about not being able to be yourself. That's why it's been so nice out here. You can do what you want to do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just so that we just get back to what Khloe was saying, 'cause I feel like she just has... a feeling of just being unresolved, but I want to move past this, so that we don't, you know, come back to this, so there's no resentment between, you know, really, you and Khloe. I think you need to know that underneath Khloe's anger, she really just... she does not care. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When Kendall and Kylie found out, I was the one who talked to them and said this doesn't change anything, what a great dad you are. I've always been defending you and protecting you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've tried to do the best with it, and the greatest thing in my life I've ever done is raise my children, you know? Look at every one of you-- successful, smart, intelligent. : You know, I am just so proud of all of you. It's my greatest accomplishment. I got everybody out of the nest, everybody's doing great. I got to deal with myself. The last thing in the world I want to do is hurt any one of you. That is not my intention. Maybe if I'm not honest 'cause I'm afraid to talk to you about this subject, 'cause I know it hurts, I understand that. Am I doing it right, Khloe? You can never do this right. Okay? There's just... there's no right way to do this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't want to talk about it in front of Mason yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's gonna come to an age and he's gonna say, "Whatever happened to that grandpa I had?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely don't want him to find out through someone at school. I want him to find out through us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not attracted to men, you're attracted to women? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm totally heterosexual. &gt;&gt; KIM: But if you're a woman, then were you a lesbian? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, you think you're gonna grow old with somebody. It's like I have to mourn Bruce Jenner. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This girl thing's a lot of work. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you really got to organize this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. It's like having Bruce with a little icing on the cake, okay? It only gets better.
