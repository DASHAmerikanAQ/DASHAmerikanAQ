- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where are we going? Doll, will you run upstairs really quick? My mom said she had a present for us for the baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I have a hug? Oh, my cutie. My cutie. Mwah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Holy, Scott! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ay, ay, ay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What theare you doing in my room? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa, calm down! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You scared the out of me. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is happening? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your mother just went nuts on me up there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She was, like, half-naked. I think she had a bra on. She was freaking out. I didn't try to go see her naked. She's, like, going nuts. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what, I wouldn't call me nuts in my own house. It's not... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You started screaming at me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm in my own home. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You go so crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have no privacy. New rule: anybody wants to come upstairs into my living space, you can page me. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you wearing underneath this robe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: My bra. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't even know what that is, a straitjacket? What is that thing? It's like a harness. Like, can somebody hold you from that thing? Like... ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna bring stuff over here to you, Khloe. Okay, can I show you this? Excuse. Excuse. Okay. Pajamas, I like when they share. These are Mase's old... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's cute. salud. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know, when I sneeze sometimes, I pee. Do you like this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When you're pregnant, you can just pee all the time. Do you like this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't control it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I did. It didn't come out. These are cute, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I don't like that one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-mm. Why does he have so many plates? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't tell you exactly. Have you seen how many cars are outside? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, they're all different? Like, so that's... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, what do you think? They're all gonna be the same? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At least two. Don't you need two? It doesn't, like, make you want to, like, ask questions? Like, why a stack of license plates? Like, you don't wonder what they're for? Why do you need 12 different license plates? What are you using them for? You don't have 12 cars. How'd you get them? Scott normally just does a lot of appearances, but I definitely noticed that lately Scott is always doing some side deal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You owe me $7,500. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I gave you that big Rolly. I don't think I owe you anything more. &gt;&gt; MAN: You're looking for some office space. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, nothing big. Just something just to, like, be able to get out of the hotel when I need to work a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I definitely noticed that lately he's been even more sheisty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do I ask you all these kind of questions? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have a wad of license plates in my car. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but I'm saying, like, in general, do you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You actually do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have to pee, actually. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It just comes like that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yep. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brandoni. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: New toy in town. Everything's been upgraded on it. Uh, all the suspension, roll cages, the engine, front end, axles. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: New swingarms. Look at these things. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I know, yeah. It's... Everything's upgraded. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: All those upgrades, they're not cheap. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: At least $30,000 in upgrades. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: $35,000 in upgrades. It's nice to have your own checkbook-- that's all I can say. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey, congratulations. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, thank you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You deserve it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is the first time in 25 years that I have actually been in charge of my finances. For all those years, I had to ask permission to buy a little screw for my helicopter. I say... we sneak across the street and run it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: We'll just have a little bit of fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just a little bit of fun and come back. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I didn't have to ask permission to buy something like this. It's kind of a good feeling. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey, wait one sec. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We'll get those up there. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Wait! ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You said you weren't feeling well because of your sinuses. So I brought you this nasal cleansing pot. So you put the salt in here. I'm gonna show you how to do it. You take this little pot and you put some warm water in it and I think you just kind of... tip your head over like... Are you watching? And it just... goes out... the... the other side. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good as new. Now that I've given you my demonstration, will you drive me to the doctor to get my epidural? &gt;&gt; KIM: When is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: In the morning. But I have to be there at, like, 6:45. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye's out of town, and I don't have any help. I don't have anyone to come that early. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are never... Nobody can ever take me anywhere. I take you guys everywhere for 30 years, and you guys can't do one doctor's appointment. I suffer from chronic neck pain, and I've found a lot of relief by getting epidurals in my neck. So I'm going in for this procedure, getting put to sleep, and all of my kids flake on me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Would you want that or would you want a crying baby in the car if, like, I wake her up early in the morning? What about Bruce? Why don't you call him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, 'cause we're divorced. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, so? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If he called me and asked me to take him to the doctor... &gt;&gt; KIM: Why is that weird? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...I guess I would take him. I'll call Bruce and see what he says. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, it's me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. What are you up to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just actually getting ready to go to a meeting, but I had a quick question. I have to get an epidural in my neck because it's driving me crazy and wanted to know if you would be willing to give me a ride to the doctor. It'll be really early, so I would need you here at, like, 6:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know me, I'm up early. Can't get these kids out of bed, so I'll, uh... I'll get you there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got a ride, babe! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I may... might have them, when I'm gone in the Bahamas, make my Rolls all black. Just 'cause I like the way... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You can just wrap that, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wrap the trim? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, and it's so easy. It takes two minutes, and... God forbid one day you wake up and say, "I want the silver." It gets pulled off. If it's painted, you can never bring it back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Got it. Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. I mean, the only thing I can think of is if somebody just wires a hundred from their personal to the other business account and then we can pay out. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a lot of money. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, nothing. Just have to do some deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, do you just listen to him doing all these big business deals? Don't you want to ask what it's for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't pay attention. I'm checking out some art to purchase on my phone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney and Scott have the most bizarre relationship, especially when it comes to business. I have always wondered what Scott does for a living, and actually I think Kourtney sweeps a lot of stuff under the rug. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where do you guys want to eat? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why am I the only one who thinks this is the weirdest car ride in the world? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think Kourt's maybe just used to these car rides. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, look who it is. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good morning. Good. How are you doing? You're nice and warm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is she sleeping? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. It is 5:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce is here to take me to the hospital for my procedure, and it feels good to have somebody with me that's familiar. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, here's your coffee. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't drink any coffee. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't drink any coffee. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shh. Love you. Good luck. Mwah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why can't you have coffee? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because they're putting me to sleep. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, they are? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. I didn't know that. I thought you were just, like, getting a little epidural or something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The little epidural is a needle into my neck. If you move on the table, you could be dead in two seconds. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But no big deal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your coffee's there when you get back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. That was really sweet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What is that jacket? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's the Yeezus Tour. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Jesus Tour? Tour. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeezus? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kanye's tour. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God, never mind. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not Jesus? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Car's parked. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: And so you're taking her home, right? You're the designated driver. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Let's take a picture, Kris going in for surgery. I'll send it to Kendall. I'm getting so good with sending this stuff. Nervous? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Any time you get put under on any level, it makes me really nervous. Something can happen so fast. We just never know. Makes me appreciate waking up from it and being okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kris, we'll just go over this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Because you're having sedation, we don't want you to drive or use any machinery till tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So you have your driver there. We don't want you to make any important decisions until tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Do you have an advance directive for health care? It's where you've written down your wishes. Usually part of a will or a trust. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Actually, I just changed it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay, so we do have one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So it's Kourtney Kardashian if anything... was to happen. For my entire marriage with Bruce, he's always been listed as the executor on my living will. But when Bruce and I got divorced, I decided Kourtney was gonna be the executor of my will. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I'll be right back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The problem I have with all of this is Kourtney with the final say. What, I'm not here? I'm the only one here. She's not here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If somebody needs to make a decision, like taking you off life support... We are divorced. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think you should be the one that would decide. Kourtney is the decision maker for my life. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney is the most indecisive person, and she's just not as smart as I thought she was growing up. I truly think I'm the most levelheaded. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just be like, "That's not my responsibility." Be like, "It has nothing to do with us." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's some shady going on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What kind of a business is he doing where all these wire transfers are happening? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If somebody needs to make a decision, like taking you off life support... We are divorced. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think you should be the one that would decide. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: First of all, nothing's going wrong. Okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think making changes in your life gets really hard, and, as sad as it is, it needs to happen. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Good morning, good morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good morning, Doctor. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: How are you starting to feel, Kris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I'm gonna start even giving you more sedation here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It smells so good in here. Kourt, I'm looking for in my closet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: These are cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Those are really cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, heavy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Kourtney, would you come to my tea party? Or maybe I could be your pen pal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just be like, "That's not my responsibility." Be like, "We don't know, we're not even there, we don't care." Like, "It has nothing to do with us." All right, let me know. Okay, bye. All right, I got to run. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you going? You don't have anywhere to go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I got to go meet somebody to close something up quick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have to what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I love you, doll. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. Scott... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khlo, I'll see you back in the hood. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're a pathological liar. I just don't understand. If you're doing something that's completely okay, why aren't you just telling us about it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, love you. Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, you're being very disrespectful. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's some shady going on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, thanks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All right, all right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are your window cleaners good? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I, like, love him. He reminds me of Papa Harry. &gt;&gt; KIM: Papa Harry was a riveting soul. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wasn't he? He was so, like... energetic. He ate tuna sandwiches with chips inside-- that's why I do that. And he had cherry ChapStick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, what's Scott up to today? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I feel like he's wheelin' and dealin'. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But what? What does he wheel and what does he deal? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like he's just, like, putting together deals, like, brokering things. I feel like he loves to buy cars. &gt;&gt; KIM: But where does he get the money to buy them? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are they stolen? Like, how else do you make a profit? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney can't answer any of Khloe's questions. I mean, he does club appearances, and I know he has income, but anyone that is so secretive about what they do has to be doing something shady. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But how does he get the money to buy cars? Like, how much can you really make off selling a car? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have no idea. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: How are you feeling? Okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just dizzy. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Careful, 'cause you still are sedated, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't know if you were gonna come out of it. You were, like, out forever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was not. How long did it take? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hours and hours and hours. I had to call your director, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did she say? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She said, "Pull the plug," and I said, "No, we can't." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, here I am. You're stuck with me. I'm ready. Maybe just help me put my shoes on. ♫ ♫ Thank you for taking me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm glad I could help out. Would Kourtney have ever, like, got your shoes on for you and... put your shirt on and... help you get out of there so quickly? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't think so. Right now Kourtney can't figure out what kind of wallpaper she wants in her house, let alone make a decision. No, she can't make that decision. You know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know if I want to talk about this while I feel so loopy. Didn't you hear the lady? She said don't make any important decisions all day today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you for helping me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm a professional at this stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're really good at it, but you still can't decide whether or not to pull my plug. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll pull your plug, baby. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce, I've got to help you get a new pair of jeans. They've got to be long, almost to the ground. You're wearing, like, bell-bottoms. They're, like, embarrassing. Like grandpa style. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Horrible. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love the hair. &gt;&gt; KIM: My hair? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. Yeah. hair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a look. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, you're telling me hair's a look? What do they say, call the kettle black? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you know what your mom did? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She went out and made Kourtney the decision maker in case she went, like, under and there was a problem... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney is the executor of the estate and the decision maker for my life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's heavy stuff. Kourtney is the most indecisive person on the planet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I agree-- she can't even decide on what wallpaper she wants in her house. &gt;&gt; KIM: She is really stubborn, she can't ever make a decision... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. I agree. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and she's just not as smart as I thought she was growing up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I should be the one to make the decision. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Definitely not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The person that I choose for this responsibility has to be able to make a great judgment really fast, so now I'm thinking Kourtney might be the wrong choice, because she's gonna be too indecisive. &gt;&gt; KIM: I truly think I'm the most levelheaded. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See, I would vote for that. &gt;&gt; KIM: You would? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know about you guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm relieved of the responsibility. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is so crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Will you take a picture of me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Is this good lighting? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like it's gonna be cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ready. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I kind of like it dark, I kind of like it dark, all right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Like, moody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, just... I am so excited-- Kylie shows up unexpected. She's 17 years old, a very busy social schedule, it's tough to get her out to the house in Malibu. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's super cute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Isn't that cute? I couldn't be more pleased that she's here. What's up with you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, just signed my hair deal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have your what now? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My hair launch-- my hair just came out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you mean your hair just came out? Really, you still look like you have a lot of hair and you have other extensions in there, don't you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's a hair extension line. My extensions didn't come out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your extension line came out, oh. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes. It was very exciting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That... I'd agree. Uh, what colors can we get? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 11 different shades. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ooh, 11 shades? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like I need a new purse. Well, I don't need a new purse. Correction: I want a new purse. I only have black purses. And sometimes I feel like I want to switch it up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Would Kim know where this stuff is? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll work on it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: In the old days, Kris bought all gifts. But now I can actually go out and buy that little purse for her. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ooh, I just ate a lot of these snacks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You did eat a lot of the snacks and now you're drinking my... drinks. God. Not easy feeding you, is it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, the things you save-- like, every little picture of you on chocolate-- this is what you save in here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They made that for me in New York for my cookbook tour. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So take a picture. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you sitting in the freezer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's hot out here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, it's Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I found all these license plates in the back of Scott's car. Like, ten to 12 different license plates-- who has ten to 12 plates? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He was wiring money from one account to another. I overheard the whole thing. What kind of a business is he doing where all these wire transfers are happening? Kourtney doesn't even bat an eyelash. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, she has, like, she's pregnant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It just doesn't make any sense-- I'm more worked up about what Scott does than she is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I for sure think Scott could be up to something. He's so shady. What if he's selling stolen cars? Well, do you ever think about what else he's not telling Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, all the time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I told you I got to meet some guy about something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott won't tell me the truth about what's going on and making me question what he's up to. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're gonna buy a bag for Kylie for $5,000? I need to have a serious talk with Bruce. The last time he was on his own, he was in debt. He's literally gonna end up, like, with nothing left. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does it bother you that this table is not centered with the lamp? These need to be directly under the light fixture so we are all okay in the world of OCD land. 'Cause at the moment it's not happening. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't even know how you sleep at night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, I-I... Right now it's really irking me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This would send me right off a bridge. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. How was your day? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was good, but I have a huge decision to make. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And it's really starting to annoy me, because I can't quite make up my mind. So I need one directive, so if something happens to me, like, who's gonna make a decision if somebody pulls the plug, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought that's Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it was Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But she seems unable to make a decision. She can't choose a paint color to save her life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I also think, like, Kourtney will, like, really do her due diligence. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, something really serious happens and they say, "What do you want us to do-- heart transplant?" She would go, "Well... I'm sorry, I'm feeding the kids and then I have to put 'em to bed." And Kim has a big heart-- she's just more cut-and-dry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, that's a tough one between Kourtney and Kim. But they're polar opposites-- you can't make them both the director, because they definitely will never, like, come to a conclusion. But Kim might just be on an off day and might just say, "Oh, I would rather be shopping." Why was I not an option? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I just was going down the line-- you were number three, and I think it would be too hard on you. You had a hard time with Daddy and you don't need to go through that with me. One of the reasons why I didn't consider Khloe first was because she was the one who took it the hardest when her dad passed away. And she's been through so much that this is the last thing that Khloe needs right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, I feel like you'd better just really think hard about your executor. I think all of us are not good to make these decisions. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you're the only ones who can make this decision, but one person's got to be in charge. But I'm gonna take into consideration the Kim factor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think Kim would pay a lot of attention to detail. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I think you would, too, by the way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but I wasn't asked to be the director or producer of your film. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's actually my death. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's a big production. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here we are, rendezvousing to do a little shopping, and when shopping needs to be done, who do you call? You call Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's look over here. I really like this section. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I need a pill. &gt;&gt; KIM: You do need a pill. Uh, what is your budget today? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Five grand. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're gonna buy a bag for Kylie for $5,000? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So you think that's too much? &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely too much. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, you're sounding more and more like Kris. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're sounding more and more like Kris. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got some money in my pocket. I'm kind of having some fun right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: So now you want to go ha... go crazy and buy everyone something. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Absolutely. Let's get gifts for everybody. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Kylie would like a bag like one of these to put all of her makeup in in the car. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. That's a Khloe picture. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe... okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't you think, for her house? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But that's so Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really happy that Bruce has this, like, independent financial freedom, but I don't think it's necessary that he goes and buys everyone gifts. Which one are you thinking? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. Do we just go all... Well, this is navy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I like that, like, gym bag-- I really, really do. I think it's different. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Either that or the backpack. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, the backpack, that's what I said. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's more backpacks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we're-we're vibing on the backpack. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're bagging on the backpack. &gt;&gt; KIM: Vibing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're bagging on the backpack. &gt;&gt; KIM: Vibing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you need this? &gt;&gt; KIM: N... I think we should put some more money into... into a hearing aid instead of the bag. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mason loves hanging with me at night. He comes and he goes, "Hello?" He lets me know and then he goes to sleep. A friend of mine opened a company like a salon, you know? Like, they basically will come to your house, give you a manicure, pedicure, massage, facial, this and that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is there anything that you would want to try? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You let me know. I could do that for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm. Should we go to Kate Mantilini? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who's going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me, Kendall, Kylie and Khloe. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that tonight? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm, yeah, but, like, early. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I have a dinner, actually, tonight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just got to meet, uh, somebody to do something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was very specific. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to meet somebody to do something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's their name? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The name's the name. Uh, you know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott won't tell me the truth about what's going on. And now my family-- they have me thinking what is Scott up to now with his business deals? And making me question what he's up to. What else are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I told you I got to meet some guy about something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think I should try and save these flowers? They're obviously a little tired, but still has a lot of life left in it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you asking me this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to know if something's just on its last leg, are you just gonna throw it away like the trash? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom and Khloe keep questioning me about what you're doing here... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I could question a lot of things about them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are the shadiest... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't saylike that. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to die? Kanye literally went crazy on the trainer today. She was like, "So, what are your goals, like, tell me everything," and I was like, "I need to get down to 120." She said, "Oh, there's no way. I can't even imagine you 15 pounds lighter." And Kanye said, "Wait a minute, you are the trainer, and you're telling me you can't imagine her 15 pounds lighter? We need to get another trainer, then, because if I tell you that she needs to lose weight in between her toe, you better figure out hertoe weight." What is that? Did Bruce get that for you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. He just gave that to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you love it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like it. You know, it's Sharon Tate, who was murdered by Charles Manson. It's just a really morbid painting, so I'm just wondering... &gt;&gt; KIM: If it sends bad vibes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce just keeps on doing everything for everyone else, which is so nice... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...but I feel like he's literally gonna end up, like, with nothing left. Seriously, this painting was really expensive. Like, no wonder my mom was always in charge of the finances. His spending is just out of control. It's, like, we love it, it's such a sweet idea, but nobody needs anything. I need to have a serious talk with Bruce, because he needs someone to look after him and just protect him a little bit so he doesn't... literally go broke. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a nice gesture. I know, I feel bad. It's just, I can't... explain how I feel about her, but it's not good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-mm. Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-mm-mm. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can you come here for a second? I have to ask you an important question. So, what do you think? Do you think I should try and save these flowers? They're a little bit wilted. do? &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it's a beautiful vase of flowers that obviously is a little tired but still has a lot of life left in it. What would you do? Do you think I should throw them out? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you asking me this? Like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know, like, do you like all the different colors? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. That's not how I do my flowers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So just because my flowers aren't like your flowers, you would just toss 'em? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I didn't say that. You said they were dead. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to know if something's just on its last leg, are you just gonna throw it away like the trash? Or are you gonna, like, try and save it for something a little more important? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll make the decision really easy for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a $3,000 vase. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ha. Easy. I even cleaned up for you. I have to look forward to. Just one big empty shell. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's a lot of people in this house today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's a lot happening today. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is a damn madhouse. It's insane over here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you like our new piece of art? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We can't have this-- we have children. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I showed it to you before-- we picked it together. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, when it was this big, on a phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I thought some of them had penises, but they don't. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, those are just oversized clitorises. I think this girl, if she stopped horsing around, she'd be a nice item. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This isn't a normal picture to have in a kid-friendly home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not racy or offensive. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Racy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's girls running out of the ocean. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think that's right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know there's a big truck out front unloading a car? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Unloading what car? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. Did you guys get a new car? It's a silver-- I don't have my glasses on, but... And look, there's a black car... And that's the gunmetal car. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's this huge truck of cars outside, with no explanation. Are these all being delivered, or just one? &gt;&gt; KIM: I wanted to help you with your finances. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My finances are good. &gt;&gt; KIM: He just can't spend whatever he wants. &gt;&gt; KIM: All I hear you doing lately is spending. Are those really your cars? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, they're not my... &gt;&gt; KIM: You can talk to me-- I'm a car kind of gal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They're not my cars. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have a right to figure out what's going on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are they stolen? Just tell me. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's the deal? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know what this is. Hey... &gt;&gt; MAN: How you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think the cars are supposed to go to the dealership, no? &gt;&gt; MAN: Nope, I have your address. That's why I brought the cars. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oy. What other cars... Hey, bud, how you doing? &gt;&gt; MAN: I got four cars for you. What should we do with them? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They were supposed to be sent to the store, not... cars, so I don't know why they came up here. &gt;&gt; MAN: Has your name on it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think just bring them down to the store. There was a mistake, for sure, somebody down there. &gt;&gt; MAN: I'll load them up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like we have a right to, you know, figure out what's going on. Are those really your cars? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, they're not my... &gt;&gt; KIM: You can talk to me-- I'm a car kind of gal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They're not my cars. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just confused. Are they stolen? Just tell me. ♫ ♫ Something smells, and I got to figure out what it is. I think it's in here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. You think? Nah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe it's just you like cheese. That's probably what it is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have friends that come over all the time. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have friends? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Friends, yeah, that come over all the time and we have cheese plates. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is there a reason for coming out? &gt;&gt; KIM: I wanted to say hi and see your place, and you always complain that we never come out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Perfect! &gt;&gt; KIM: So it's not that far. But I will say, I wanted to help you with your finances. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you want to help me with my finances? My finances are good. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I want to keep them that way. You know, just I was concerned, 'cause you're going out buying Kylie a $5,000 purse, which is half of your mortgage. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, that's for Kylie. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are... buying cars... motorcycles. I just, I'm concerned. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's kind of, like, getting hot in here. It's too nice outside. Let's go outside. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. I will follow you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's gorgeous out there-- that's why we're at the beach. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I just have to school Bruce a little bit. The last time he was on his own, he was in debt, so I fear that that'll happen again if he doesn't have someone just, like, talk to him and explain to him that he just can't spend whatever he wants whenever he wants. So, are you saving money? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Am I saving money? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, all I hear you doing lately is spending. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have to admit, over... the last month, two months, I did spend some money and kind of had a little bit of fun with that. &gt;&gt; KIM: You had to splurge. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I did splurge. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know you're spending money on, like, Kylie and just everyone, and you really don't need to-- we all have, like, more than enough stuff. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, honestly, when I go out with my kids, I like... buying gifts, all that stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: And we appreciate that, but don't ever feel like you have to. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's been good to be able to, like, splurge on my kids. But I understand where Kim's coming from. They're all grown up now, they all have their own lives, they're all doing very well-- it's not like I really have to buy them anything to show them my love, and it's nice that they kind of get that. Well, I appreciate you coming out and doing this, but... I think I'm doing okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: See? That's a dollar sign right there-- you have a... a pick with a dollar sign to remind you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's it, right there. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so hungry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, really hungry. Thank you. Isn't today Lamar's birthday? Do you have his number so I could text him "happy birthday"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: His phone is off. It's been off for... um, about a month. I've been trying to call him forever. His phone's been off for, like, three weeks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just really wanted to say happy birthday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I wanted to do the same. I can't help you there, Mom, if I can't find him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe always seems to find this amazing inner strength, and, especially this past decade, she's grown by leaps and bounds emotionally and spiritually. And Khloe is the person who I think is the most compassionate to me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are the shadiest... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't saylike that. I think they should not ask me what deals I'm involved in. It's really nobody's business. I'm telling you, for real, don't talk to me like that. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys. I totally cussed out this girl driving. It was so funny. They were, like, going crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you want? What color? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why'd you get lollipops? Did you go to the dentist? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. This'll tell a lot about you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll have orange. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would pick red. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would pick red, too. So what does it tell about us? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're suckers. I think the best thing for a parent is spending my time with my kids. North has to spend more time with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, we just have to bond a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: North plays hard to get. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wonder where she learned that from. Nothing makes me happier to watch my kids smile, laugh, spend time together. 'Cause that's what life's all about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nope. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Shall I take that out of your way? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yep. Done. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruiser, are you gonna pay for us? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everybody owes $16. &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't even bring my credit card. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cash will work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't even need to spend the 16 bucks-- I'll pick it up for you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Doing good, huh? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe and Kourtney, come to my office. Hey, little cuties. I'm looking at an owners and officers list. The top name is Scott Disick, president of Calabasas Luxury Motorcars. President. Did you know this was his company? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't get me started. I find it weird that Scott won't tell me the truth. I just don't get it. Owning a business is something to be proud of. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why doesn't he just tell us he has this full-on business going on? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Doll, are you strong enough to move that shell back on this table? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The shell. &gt;&gt; SCOTT:That's really... You need that here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is not what I do for a living. I'm not a mover. It'd better not be heavy. Have you felt this thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What about that other plant? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thisis, like, real heavy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That means you got to start going to the gym. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That goes there. Uh, did you break the vase when you put it down? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. Anything else? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, since you're not strong enough to move that thing, I think you need to start lifting weights. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'll remember to do that in between everything else. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In between what, going to the car dealership? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's that supposed to mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom and Khloe keep questioning me about what you're doing here and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I could question a lot of things about them. You know, I've never asked Kourtney or anybody in her family how much they're making on certain deals or appearances, so I think they should owe me the same respect and not ask me what deals I'm involved in. It's really nobody's business. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are the shadiest... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't saylike that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, and I'm telling you, for real, don't talk to me like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you just not want to say that you are a car salesman? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's not funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? I'm-I'm asking. For real. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A business I own sells exotic cars, but... I don't personally. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why wouldn't you openly talk about it and be excited? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's nothing to talk about. I don't like bringing stuff home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But admit it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's nothing to admit. I don't like talking about work. You know that. I thought that was what's fun about us, that we keep it a little exciting and we don't tell each other every annoying detail about what we do for a living all day long. Let's just say I'm the international man of mystery, and you should be excited about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I understand why Scott does not want to tell me about his part in Calabasas Luxury Motorcars, just because Scott thinks he's, like, this lord or something, but I'm just glad that it's not something illegal and that it's a legit company. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've got your number just like you got mine. Is yours still 911? All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's 411. I have all the info. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Mother! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I love your red coat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. chic. So, one of my girlfriends is buying me a miniature pony... &gt;&gt; KRIS: A real one? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. And it's gonna graze in my backyard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you're just gonna get one, so it's lonely? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm gonna get two, actually. I am getting two. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A boy and a girl? Will they have babies? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My animals don't have intercourse. They're celibate ponies. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How do you know that? What if you get a horny one? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, n... this isn't ex... actually a question. It's a decision that I finally was able to make, and I wanted to let you know that I've decided that you're gonna be in charge of... being the executor to my will. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, so once you're dead? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I get sick, then you make the medical decisions... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get out of town. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. Isn't that exciting? So lucky you. I think that you are the most nurturing person in the world. I've really realized that you're the only one who really... can handle going through something like that. I really do have a great sense of relief because I finally made a decision. Khloe has been through so much, and she's proven to me that she has incredible strength and the ability to handle a big task like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I love you. I know you'll take care of me, Khloe. You're actually my favorite. Don't tell anybody. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's get it on! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Welcome to the DASH retreat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We will eliminate the people that we don't think can get theirtogether. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm really, really worried about Rob. If I don't do something drastic, he's gonna die. We have to start with getting him help. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just accept the ing help. &gt;&gt; KIM: Trying for baby number two is, like, so much harder. Wait, you have to remove my uterus? Can I still get pregnant? &gt;&gt; HUANG: I can't guarantee that. I'm gonna do everything I can. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to carry my own children.
