- &gt;&gt; KIM: Tonight on... &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome to Armenia. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. Hi. Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was always so important to my dad for us to go to Armenia. I have to talk to you. I have something so important to tell Khloe. Guess what? Kanye is so excited to spend the day at an art school. &gt;&gt; KANYE: That sounds dope. &gt;&gt; KIM: Right before Dad passed away, he said, "I'm just so pissed at God that I didn't have enough time with my son. Take care of him." It just makes you feel like, you failed him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to cook. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, we got to flour up the counters. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you clean your counter first? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. What are you here with? &gt;&gt; KIM: Shrooms. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Aah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mase, we're making pizza! Come here and help. Hey, Scott. Oh, your beard's growing like a wolf. Where's Kylie? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She flaked on us. Kylie has been really distant, just not responding to texts, which is so not like her. I just feel bad. I think, with our dad transitioning, everyone's been really emotional and dealing with everything differently, so I just want to make sure that she's okay, but I just, like, haven't even seen her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good job, Kourt! Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, kids, who wants a piece of pizza? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who wants a piece of pizza? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: One time, my friend Sarah was over, and we were making pizza, and we got so frustrated that we literally rolled this with all the ingredients and shoved it in there, and we're like, "We're just making a calzone." And then we took it out. The whole middle was dough. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your mommy is crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, I made a hole. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just eating some froyo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why wouldn't you ask if I wanted froyo? &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause I got this yesterday, and I just got it out of the freezer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. DO you want some ice cream to go with your sprinkles? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Trying to pack for Armenia. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so cool that we're going. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't wait. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're gonna meet with a ton of people, and we're gonna go to really fun restaurants, have some Armenian food... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The food, that's literally, like, why I'm going. &gt;&gt; KIM: Those little beeshees. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! Ever since Kim and I have been little girls, it's always been in our plan to go to Armenia one day, and it's so exciting that now we are finally going to do this. What are we wearing in Armenia? &gt;&gt; KIM: So it's a little cold there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Checking the weather. Smart. &gt;&gt; KIM: We definitely should be more conservative. The Genocide anniversary is coming up, and we're bringing, like, a lot of attention to the country. It is the 100-year anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, where more than a million people were killed. It's just heartbreaking. It was always so important to my dad for us to understand about the Genocide and just to know about our family history. For that, Kanye and I want to baptize our daughter, in Jerusalem, in the Armenian Quarter, and it's just going to mean everything to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You, me, North and Kanye are gonna rule that town. &gt;&gt; KIM: Dad would have been so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just trying to get everything ready. We're leaving for Armenia tonight. What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is Rob here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, he's in his room. Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wanted just to come by and see if he was gonna go to Armenia with you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's not going to Armenia, and I told you that. You know he's not going. Rob is just going through a tough time. He's been really depressed. He doesn't want to be in public. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is bigger than you are, and you need to let people help you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We want want Rob to go to Armenia. It was always something that was super important to my dad, but it doesn't look like that one's gonna happen. You guys got to, like, leave him alone and let him have a breather. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's had a breather. I just want to encourage him to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you want to force him to go to Armenia with the most popular Armenian girl ever? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is Rob in here? Rob? Huh. Okay, well, he's not here, Khlo. Did he say, "I wish I could go on the trip," or, "It sounds amazing?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. We would love for him to do that. That would be a dream, but we know he's not, so we're not gonna force the issue. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom is so overwhelmed and stressed out about all of us kids and how everyone's dealing with everything, but I really think that my mom is having the toughest time. I think coming to Armenia with us would be good for her, but she's been so emotional that she just can't pull it together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, well, I'm gonna go. Tell him to call me when he gets back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, honey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome to Armenia. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome to Armenia. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, how are you? When we first get to Armenia, we are greeted by government officials, and there are so many fans, and everyone out excited to meet us, and we're so excited to meet them. Hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: This like a welcoming. Take a small piece and put it in the salt. &gt;&gt; KIM: And try it? This is so good. &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome to Armenia. &gt;&gt; KIM and KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I double dipped. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's, like, food and tons of people and music and cheering. It's really overwhelming, but in, like, such a great way. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Kim, are you happy to be here? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're very happy to be here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How freaking exciting is this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Really cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're in Armenia. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're staying at the Marriott. It's supposed to be, like, the nicest here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is just crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney really should have come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney should do a lot of things. &gt;&gt; KIM: This one, we should've really forced her. This trip is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's such an important time in Armenia, and I really wish that Kourtney was here, but I know she has enough on her plate, and she's dealing with the kids and the new baby. But then you have Rob. I think this would've been such an eye opener for him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's literally military people. We're used to big crowds, but it's complete, like, pandemonium outside our hotel room. They're all chanting Kim's name. I mean, Kim is in her glory. She loves all this. If Kim ever, like, loses a little bit of fame, she should just move to Armenia. She'll be golden for the rest of her life. &gt;&gt; CROWD: Kim! Kim! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like I'm with the Princess of Armenia. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wish there was a balcony that we can be like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can pose? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like Eva Perón. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you ready to go on our Armenian adventure? Day one. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's Yeesus? &gt;&gt; KIM: He is actually gonna wait for North and get her up and dressed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause she's so jet-lagged. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, she's still sleeping. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. So, I have to talk to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have something so important to tell Khloe. I don't know if it's the right time, but I just can't hold it in any longer. Guess what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So what is a day in the life of Kylie Jenner like? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to have an honest conversation with Kylie. I want to make sure that she's okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why do you need Lamar's number? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I could check on him. Lamar and I loved each other deeply. I don't ever come at you about all your triflingyou used to do. Take a chill pill, slor. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you feeling? My mom is having a really emotional time, dealing with Caitlyn's transition. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had such a day yesterday. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Guess what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just got... I just got the blood test back from my doctor, and I am pregnant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this a joke again? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Why would I joke? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know! You did it last time. Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited. This is a dream. It has been extremely hard to get pregnant. I've been having sex 500 times a day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I still get pregnant? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: I can't guarantee that. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, we've done little operations on my uterus. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You're almost done. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was so close to giving up, and that's when it happened. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When did you find out? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, two days ago. But I haven't told anyone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just you. I told North last night, but I don't think she understands. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't take it for granted, the fact that this is, like, a miracle that's happened. And I just feel so blessed to be pregnant again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so exciting. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, then I don't want you to do too much. &gt;&gt; KIM: I haven't worked out, like, in two weeks. They told me to, like, rest. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know how I get when my sisters are pregnant. I'm very protective. I'm just happy that my sister's pregnant. I'm just really excited. I want there to be more kids. I really, like, thrived when you were fat and pregnant and they compared you to a whale. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was the first time I was ever, like, the thin one. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, your moment to shine. You've got to do every sexy photo shoot you could possibly imagine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, no. We're not putting pressure on me like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney's just not sexy anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't... I really can't handle that much pressure. &gt;&gt; KIM: We need sexy Kardashians. You are it; like, you have to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's so sad, that you guys have to be pregnant for me to be the thin one. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited that I took every last thing out of storage. Whatever I don't sell, I'm gonna give away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did Kylie use that Lucite table? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kylie is such a bitch, by the way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What has she done now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nothing, she just doesn't respond. I literally wrote her last night and I said, "Hey, do you want to work out with me?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, you could at least write back "N-O." &gt;&gt; KRIS: She definitely has teenage tendencies. I really worry about Kylie, all the time, just naturally, as her mom. But with everything going on, with the transition and everything, I'm especially concerned about Kylie right now, because she's being a little elusive and I just hope she's okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Kylie. Why do you not text people back? Like, is it that hard... if you don't want to work out with me, is it that hard to just write "N-O"? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I didn't even see your workout text, is the problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're on your phone 24 hours. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What happens is I wake up in the morning, I see, like, the last person who texted me and then I go on with my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Speaking of your life, where are you right now? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, that's Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. Kylie? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She hung up. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew, don't wipe, that looks gross. Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtni and Kara are my cousins on my dad's side. We have always been incredibly close with them, especially as kids, and they just remind me of my dad in so many ways. So having them join us on this trip to Armenia makes it that much more special. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I post it on my Vine? &gt;&gt; KARA: What's "Vine"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're not telling you any more about social... "'Vaht' is V...?" &gt;&gt; KIM: Should we walk outside and say hi to everyone? &gt;&gt; GUARD: If you approach them, they're gonna surround you again. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Hey, hi! Hi, hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my gosh, look at this old lady out front, to the right. &gt;&gt; KIM: There are tons of people waiting outside of the hotel and we heard that there is this older woman from Gyumri, the same town in Armenia that my ancestors are from, and she's been waiting for hours and hours. So I just want to go outside and say hi. Nice to meet you. Hi. &gt;&gt; GUARD: She's from Gyumri. She says you're the sweetest girl in the world. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Best girl in the... world! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So sweet. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's nice to meet you. How are you? We love you guys! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How cute was that old lady? &gt;&gt; KIM: So cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was bonkers. "You guys are so famous." ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: All righty. Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? Hi. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; GUARD 2: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is very cool. It's our first day here in Armenia and the Megerian carpet factory has invited everyone to have a traditional dinner. They're going to do a fashion show for us and it's all in this authentic Armenian carpet factory. And we really want to soak up as much culture as we can. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; ANI: Oh, hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; ANI: I am the representative of Teryan Cultural Center. Enjoy your good evening with Armenian national music, food, and Armenian traditional clothes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; ANI: So let's turn on the music, please. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have one question. &gt;&gt; ANI: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My brother isn't here and you're such a beautiful girl. Can I take a picture of you? I want to show my brother how beautiful Armenian girls are. &gt;&gt; KIM: Should we get all the girls together? 'Cause they're all beautiful girls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. All the single ladies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who's all single? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One, two, three. Yes! ♫ ♫ That's pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really want that necklace. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So say that. They'll literally give you the necklace. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ANI: I hope you like it. &gt;&gt; KIM: So beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really loved it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love this one necklace-- that one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNI: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; ANI: You can wear it now, if you want. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw... Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everybody here has been so welcoming that literally if Kim said, "Oh, your daughter is so cute!" they would give Kim their daughter. &gt;&gt; ANI: The masters of our center have prepared presents for all of you: Armenian traditional garments. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Awesome, thank you. &gt;&gt; ANI: Let's go! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's beautiful. Ooh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNI: You look like royalty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look like Mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Cute. Ooh, or this one. Does this go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't take all the goods, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not. I'm just trying them both on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have a big head. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what you remind me of? Aladdin. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. Kim said I look like Aladdin. &gt;&gt; KOURTNI: You know how to say "monkey" in Armenian? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, do you? Gahbeeg. Gahbeeg! Come on, let's just leave Kim here. All of you guys, thank you. gahbeeg. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They clapped for her? What did she do so special that we didn't do? Oh, Princess Jasmine is dancin' and dancin'. Yes, girl. &gt;&gt; ANI: Kim, please! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm great at watching. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you have to go. It's rude. Kim, you have to go. They just gave you a necklace. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe will. Khloe. She loves to dance. She wants to dance with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone has been so generous, so I feel like I have to dance to just, like, take one for the team. What are we doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm Kim's little monkey. I'm dancing. Dance, monkey, dance. &gt;&gt; ANI: Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you! Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Check out Norm. He's straight up chillaxing! Is this how they sit? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. They can only sleep together. They have, like, anxiety if they don't sleep together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, what is a day in the life of Kylie Jenner like? Kylie flakes out a lot on different family things that we're doing. I just really want to know what she's up to. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. I'm... have such a boring life right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you do every night? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye's so excited to spend the day at an art school. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I'm going to take you to our music department. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Can I hear something? ♫ ♫ It sounds dope. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, God. Scott, what are you doing here? Like, what am I doing that's so bad that you have to show up at my lunch? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, what is a day in the life of Kylie Jenner like? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. I'm... have such a boring life right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you do every night? I really just want to have an honest conversation with Kylie. I just really want to make sure that she's okay with everything that's going on in her life, because with my brother, when he was in an emotional place, we may have not noticed certain things. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I've been working on my house a lot. So I will always will go have meetings there, go and check it out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Imagine being in the 12th grade, buying your own home, talking about meeting with interior decorators. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's pretty wild. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Super wild. I was just thinking about which chick would let me throw it in her that night, you know what I'm screaming? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pow! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you do every day for lunch? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. Sometimes I like to make myself homemade tacos... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is a lie. I know you don't do that. I know you are a lady who lunches every day. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I said sometimes I'll make myself an occasional homemade taco. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's do taco night. Is there any Mexican places we can go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, remember we heard about that amazing Mexican place? You're always looking to have lunch around here. You can go with Kylie. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You can be my Valley girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sometimes I feel like Kylie thinks the family is so judgmental, and I think even though Scott is family, they're more like friends, and so she just might be more able to open up to him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, we've gotta do taco night. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 'Cause Kourtney sucks at making tacos. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doll, you made me get sick, almost, the time you made me tacos. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause you made me buy meat at a grocery store that didn't have organic. &gt;&gt; SCOTT:Please. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was bad meat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sure that's why it would happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you believe we're in Armenia? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. They really are the best. &gt;&gt; MAN: I love you! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys! I have a list of all of the Armenian spots that we should go to. And since music and the arts are so important to Kanye, he's so excited to spend the day at an art school and learn a lot about Armenian music, technology and the Armenian culture. This is the stuff he loves to do. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Kim! Selfie! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we'll take a selfie. &gt;&gt; PASCAL: We should move. People are getting wild. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think Pascal forgot about me. &gt;&gt; MAN: Excuse me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Pascal! My own security should not leave me behind. Hi. Remember... Kim's sister. Thank you. I was completely forgotten about. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, we were watching you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I was completely hounded and I was like, "Hello? Am I, what am I supposed to do over here?" Whatever. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Hey, what's up? &gt;&gt; MARIE LOU: I'm Marie Lou. How are you? &gt;&gt; KANYE: Hey, how you doing, Marie, Lou. What's up? &gt;&gt; MARIE LOU: Welcome, It's an after-school program for 6,000 students. It's completely free and it teaches art and technology. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I love it; both those things. &gt;&gt; MARIE LOU: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MARIE LOU: Let me show you the robotics room. &gt;&gt; KANYE: The robots? Cool. &gt;&gt; MARIE LOU: Yes, they learn how to use sensors. They learn how to program. &gt;&gt; KANYE: That's dope. I like robots. This is what I'm afraid of right here. 3D printing. Because the Internet destroyed the music industry. &gt;&gt; MARIE LOU: Yes. &gt;&gt; KANYE: And now, this is what we're afraid of right now with the textile industry. &gt;&gt; MARIE LOU: Still, you have to design. It doesn't do it by itself. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Yeah, but I'm saying there will come a time where it's, like, people are making their shoes at home. &gt;&gt; MARIE LOU: Yeah, you're right. You're right. I'm going to take you to our music department. I know you like that. So, we have different type of groups. Saro, you introduce your group. &gt;&gt; SARO: You can come up, dude, if you want to check it out. We've just been trying to do, like, a live improv thing. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Can I hear something? &gt;&gt; SARO: Yeah, let's do it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KANYE: It sounds like "Cruel Summer." &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KANYE: That song with, uh, with Travis Scott. It's dope. &gt;&gt; KANYE: It's very cool. Very good, dope. That sounds dope. &gt;&gt; KANYE: What's up? &gt;&gt; MARIE LOU: This is our animation studio. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Hi, it's me. I'm Liz. This is an art school that is trying to sort of expose kids to where arts meets technology. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Which is the future. I want to mix these two things. I went to, I went to art school. Art college, actually. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Oh, yeah, what art college? &gt;&gt; KANYE: The American Academy of Art in Chicago. &gt;&gt; MARIE LOU: Do you want to continue in that field? &gt;&gt; KANYE: That's my mission in life. What if you did a shot right at the end, so you can see the entirety. They're shooting my wife's show and I keep on, like, asking them to shoot it like it's Stanley Kubrick. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Nice. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What's the most popular enchilada? &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Our Doña Rosa enchiladas. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'll have that. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Okay, Doña Rosa? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Just-just one chicken one. Is it shredded chicken? &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: It's shredded chicken and it's cooked with onions and tomatoes. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, cool. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Scott's calling me. He has maybe called me ten times today. Kourtney and Scott keep calling me and think that I'm up to something shady, asking me a million and a half questions about what I do all the time, who I'm with. But sometimes I just want to do my own thing. &gt;&gt; JORDYN: Oh, you're the only person I know that loves shredded chicken. It's so &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love shredded chicken. &gt;&gt; JORDYN: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you stalking me? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: How many people were lost in the genocide? &gt;&gt; KIM: 1.5 million. &gt;&gt; ARPI: The Ottoman Empire, they would drown them, hang them... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: People still treat me as if I don't know what's going on. I just need everyone off my back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you stalking me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just saw your car. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Scott, what are you doing here? Like, what am I doing that's so bad that you have to show up at my lunch? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thought I'd, uh, stop by and see what you were up to. With her dad's transition happening, I don't think anybody really knows what's going on with Kylie. She has been kind of disconnected. So I decided to check in to see if there's anything suspicious going on with her. I've been trying to reach you, but no answer. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, because you're embarrassing me in front of my friends. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's hard to... How am I embarrassing you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm embarrassed! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You should be excited that you have a big brother figure that loves you and wants to see what you're up to. You act like we broke! You used to answer my calls, like, a year or two ago, and, like, be fine, like, "Oh, my God, I'd totally go to sushi!" and stuff. Now, you're like, "Oh, I'd love to go to sushi. I'll meet you there never..." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I never find you. You're just, like, lost in your ways. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, thanks for... crashing... whatever. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't worry about it. Next time I see you around town, I'll be sure to stop back in. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Great. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was for Jordyn today, not for you. I just knew she was with you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't flatter yourself, Kylie. I'll walk you out, though, I mean, if I'm here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You are so weird. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The only thing I can do, really, is leave. I just needed to find out if there's anything suspicious, and there really isn't. The awkward walk-off. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll see you guys later, man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We've got to smile more-- we literally look like someone forced us to be in front of that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And we literally look... &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I don't smile because I, like, look so crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you just just try to smile a little bit? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, some pictures, I will smile. &gt;&gt; KARA: I will tickle you and just make you smile. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe, like, eight months ago, I met this woman who did, like, all this research on, like, our family history and everything, so she's gonna meet us for lunch and go over it with us. &gt;&gt; KARA: Oh, cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: And any questions that we have, she'll be able to answer them. I set up a lunch with this girl, Arpi, who has really helped with all of our genealogy findings, and I'm excited to hear what else she's found. &gt;&gt; KARA: It's so cool, uh, all different people that are Armenian are posting, like, how excited and proud they are that you're here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw, that makes me so happy. It's crazy 'cause, like, people, like, if I'm like, "Sorry, um, sorry for the late response, I'm in Armenia," they, like, haven't heard of Armenia. &gt;&gt; KARA: How have you not heard of it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, people have; I don't think they think it's still an existing country. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just can't believe they have KFC in Armenia. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna take a few pictures with them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; FEMALE FAN: Hi, Khloe, we love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you too. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you know that I do not like hummus, but this is divine? &gt;&gt; ARPI: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; ARPI: Good, how are you? Pleasure. Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe, nice to see you. &gt;&gt; ARPI: Arpi, pleasure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNI: Hi, Kourtni. &gt;&gt; ARPI: Kourtni. &gt;&gt; KARA: Hi, I'm Kara. &gt;&gt; ARPI: Kara. Welcome to Armenia, ladies. Welcome home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you, yeah, we're excited. &gt;&gt; ARPI: So, Gyumri, your ancestors are from there, so we contacted the diocese at Gyumri, and we found your ancestors' house. And it's still standing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; ARPI: And we will be going there... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; ARPI: ...so you can walk through the yard that your ancestors did. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is insane that they actually found the house that my great-great grandparents lived in, and I am so excited. &gt;&gt; KARA: How many people were lost in the genocide? &gt;&gt; KIM: 1.5 million. &gt;&gt; ARPI: Yes. &gt;&gt; KARA: 1.5 million? &gt;&gt; ARPI: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: My great-great grandparents, that's why they moved to California. &gt;&gt; ARPI: The Ottoman Empire leaders wanted to break the backbones of the Armenians, to attack clergymen, intellectuals, people who were the leaders of the Armenian people, and that was their target. They would drown them, hang them, uh, bury them alive. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's horrible to hear what all of these people went through. None of that should be endured or allowed by anybody. The Genocide is not acknowledged by the U.S. government. Like, they don't acknowledge it. That's why we also want to bring awareness to that. &gt;&gt; ARPI: Politics. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, actually, just... I'm in my bathroom, cleaning my drawer. Um, next chapter. &gt;&gt; KIM: Since the Diane Sawyer special, my mom is having a really emotional time dealing with Caitlyn's transition and what that must feel like... being married to someone for almost 25 years would be harder than I think you and I can even imagine. How are you feeling? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had such a day yesterday. &gt;&gt; MAN: Armenian Genocide was not just attempt to destroy Armenian civilization, it's a story of human life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Find out if there's any flights to Armenia. After talking to Kim, I realized I don't want to miss this experience with my family. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you feeling? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had such a day yesterday, and I just... That was really strange. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wanted to tell you something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am pregnant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! No, you're not! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! &gt;&gt; KIM: Finally. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! That's so... Oh, my God! That's the best thing I've heard in so long. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need time to... : Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't cry, it makes me cry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so happy. I'm sohappy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know my mom has really been struggling and it's really been hard for her, so to share the news with her makes me so happy to see her excited and finally happy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's such great news. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, well, have fun, be careful. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, love you. I'll see you when I get back. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you too. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Isn't it cute? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I actually could probably get rid of half these jackets. I need to clean them out. Today she's wearing a crop top, with, like, baggy pants. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Everyone's been worried about me. I just feel like it's time to talk to Kourtney because I just need everyone off my back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like you just live your own life, and Mom always says, "Oh, she's a teenager." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, also 'cause people just, like, make me mad, 'cause I feel like people still treat me as if I don't know what's going on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think I've just been dealing with trying to hang out with Dad and Mom. I've been spending a lot of time with Dad, actually. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I've been there, like, almost every day, and I know Mom will just be weird about it, I feel like. Not weird about it, but I don't want to hurt her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I can see how Kylie would feel like she could be hurting Mom's feelings by spending so much time with Caitlyn, especially living with Mom and seeing her going through such a heartbreaking time, but I'm relieved to know that Kylie has been spending time with her dad, that they're continuing a relationship, and that she loves Caitlyn. That makes me really happy. You know, I have not met Caitlyn yet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Shut up. I love Caitlyn. She's coming over today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No way. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, at 6:00, if you want to come. It's just gonna be me and her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe I will. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But I just, I'm not trying to hurt anybody. So I just, like, don't really tell anyone where I am ever. I have such a different relationship with my mom and my dad, and I feel caught in the middle. I just don't want anyone to get hurt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, I was gonna ask you-- do you want this, um, orange tray? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Stop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? 'Cause it just doesn't go out here right now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I would love it. I'll use this as my alcohol thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm kidding. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Come on, bubs. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I'll ride with her. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Got it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'll let you put her in the car, just... I'll grab your computer. I'm getting Dad's computer. Today we are driving to the town where our ancestors originated from. It's called Gyumri, and we're so excited to learn about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I forgot my Blackberry, but it's broken. I wanted a number out of there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whose phone number? Anyone anyone I would know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I needed Lamar's number, but I only have it in there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why do you need Lamar's number? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I could check on him. I haven't had my Blackberry all week since I've been here, 'cause it's broken, and I wanted to make sure he's okay. Can't I do that? &gt;&gt; KIM: You just deserve so much better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar and I loved each other deeply, and I don't believe in just acting like that relationship never existed. Things happened, but that doesn't just stop me from caring about him or loving him, so if I feel the need to check on Lamar, that's my prerogative, and I'm gonna do it. I'm still, no matter what, his friend, and I care to see if he's alive for the day. I can't do that? I don't ever come at you about all your triflingyou used to do until you got married, so take a chill pill, slor. &gt;&gt; KIM: Right before Dad passed away, he said, "I know you're gonna be okay. I'm just worried about my son." I really tried hard to get Rob to be motivated to come on the trip. In a lot of ways, I feel like I failed my dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; TIGRAN: This is the old house of Kardashians family in Gyumri. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Today we are in the town called Gyumri, and we're gonna get to see the house that my great-great grandparents lived in, and it's just gonna be fascinating. &gt;&gt; TIGRAN: This is the oldest part of the house. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that the original door? &gt;&gt; TIGRAN: Yes, it is. And actually, this house was very famous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; TIGRAN: Because Kardashian family were the founders of first cheese factory in Gyumri. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love cheese! &gt;&gt; TIGRAN: Oh. And they were quite cool, and... jarpic? Jarpic? Uh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. What's the word? Jarpic? Jarpic. &gt;&gt; TIGRAN: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, were they jarpic? &gt;&gt; KIM: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They were with it. &gt;&gt; TIGRAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I learned an Armenian jarpic. &gt;&gt; TIGRAN: They were, actually. &gt;&gt; KIM: How come everyone takes, like, a double take to understand what you're saying? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I say Armenian words... &gt;&gt; TIGRAN: People still remember them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They made a big impact. &gt;&gt; TIGRAN: Yes, actually they have. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh, how cool. It's so crazy to hear all of the similarities that went on between our ancestors and us today. I just really wish Rob was here to hear these stories first-hand, because our family went through so much to create this better life for us, and I think it would maybe strike a chord with him. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I love you, Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi! Love you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The echo of "Kim! Kim! Kim!" &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kim, I love you! &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you, too! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I think they were so happy to have their-their queen on their land. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look what I found at the house. I found a coin. &gt;&gt; KARA: That is so cool, Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNI: That is way cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whenever you find coins, you should look at them deeper, because it's like an angel speaking to you. It could be something from Dad that you hold onto and you realize later. &gt;&gt; KIM: We said to my dad when passed away, we're like, "Will you come back as, like, a bird and let us know you're okay." And this has a bird on it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See? &gt;&gt; KARA: I wonder what year it is. We need to put it in soda. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, it says 1994. &gt;&gt; KARA: It's okay. Still. &gt;&gt; KOURTNI: That's all right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; RACHAEL: Nat said she has not gotten a call, so I'll just add them now for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just, yeah, add them now. I was gonna have you try and find out if there's absolutely any other flights to Armenia. After talking to Kim and hearing that she's pregnant, I realized I got so lost in myself and my emotions and everything I've been going through, that I didn't anticipate wanting to go so much. I don't want to miss North's baptism. I don't want to miss this experience with my family. So... &gt;&gt; RACHAEL: There's flights. It just doesn't make sense for you to go right now, 'cause you would never get there in time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Even if I left right this second, by the time I got there, everybody would be gone? &gt;&gt; RACHAEL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Since when did you do this whole, like, genealogy report? &gt;&gt; KIM: That is because all of the records and stuff have been burned. You really need to get someone from, like, an ancestry company that really does all the research. It's just crazy to think that we're the last set of Kardashians, and Rob is the only male Kardashian that can carry on the name. He's, like, the last living one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He told me when we left, I was like, "Bye, Rob." He's like, "Bring me back a good Armenian girl." I was like, "Okay." &gt;&gt; KIM: I just remember that, like, right before Dad passed away, he said, "I know you're gonna be okay. I'm just worried about my son. Take care of him." And then it just makes you feel likeyou failed him, you know? I really tried hard to get Rob to be motivated to come on the trip, but that didn't happen, and in a lot of ways, I feel like I failed my dad, and that just makes me sad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think we failed Dad. We still have time. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like that was what he asked of me. "Take care of your siblings." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We got to get Rob back together, but if Rob doesn't want to help himself, no matter what we do, we can't help Rob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See how mad people were getting that I posted that thing with the last name Odom? &gt;&gt; KARA: Why was it on there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Odom? &gt;&gt; KARA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's my legal name. My name is Khloe. &gt;&gt; KARA: Oh, you didn't change it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...my middle name Kardashian, my last name is Odom. No, he hasn't signed my divorce papers. &gt;&gt; KARA: That's baloney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: The girl was saying that it was really hard to do people's, like, genealogy because every record was lost that linked them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's sad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. We're on our way to the Genocide memorial, and we are so humbled to get this opportunity to learn about our history, the genocide in Armenia and just pay my respects. &gt;&gt; SUREN: Nice to meet you here. I am director of memorial complex-- welcome, welcome. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Khloe. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SUREN: My name is Suren. Nice to meet you. Tsitsernakaberd memorial complex is dedicated to one and half million victims of Armenian Genocide. You know, Armenian Genocide was not just killing. It was attempt to destroy Armenian civilization, and it's story of human life. Of course, when we say one and a half million, it's a faceless number, but you can imagine that it was one plus one plus one plus one, and everybody had his plans, had his dreams for this life. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was always so important to my dad to understand about the Genocide. He always talked about it when we were growing up, and just being here is a little bit overwhelming, just because it really does just put everything into perspective when you think about how many people were killed and how many lives this affected. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. Just even right now, like, the pink clouds and everything, it's just really powerful. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's such a beautiful memorial, it just takes your breath away. It is unbelievable to think that it's been 100 years of people denying that this genocide ever happened, and I'm proud to bring awareness to the issue. My ancestors, they went through so much, and I really hope that, one day, America will recognize it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNI: Did you hear about how when he was saying they tried to erase our... &gt;&gt; KIM: Culture. &gt;&gt; KOUTNI: Culture, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: How do people not believe this if there's, like... &gt;&gt; KARA: Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...facts? &gt;&gt; KARA: I felt like, by Kim posting stuff on Facebook, people were saying, like, "I didn't even know this happened." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, people don't know it happened. It's so crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: My dad was so proud of, like, our heritage. It makes me so sad that Rob doesn't feel that way and, like, want to start a family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think that Rob is just going through a tough time. All we can do is be there for Rob, but other than that, we can't want him to get better more than he wants to get better. Rob said, "I'm gonna make my comeback," and sent me this picture. &gt;&gt; KIM: I like that. &gt;&gt; KARA: Say, "You can do it." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "You can do it." Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KANYE: Armenia, how you doing tonight?! &gt;&gt; KIM: The next part of our trip is heading to Jerusalem to baptize North. Caitlyn let me take this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I still have a long way to go before I can process all of this. He's gone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't cry. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The only thing is, I haven't met her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't either. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I am about to faint. She was, like, I'm just gonna ask you one question about Dad. And I had a little attack. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you read it? I'm not gonna be fully supportive if she's not fully supportive of our mom. Lamar says hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know why Khloe and Lamar are talking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not gonna not talk to Lamar because you disapprove. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello, beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Corey? When did he get there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I literally probably have too much sex. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's just too much. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Damn, look, I feel like a promoter tonight with all these bitches. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is, like, on a crazy bender. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Scott Disick gets very hands-on with brunette stylist." He's a &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've worked so hard to keep this family together.
