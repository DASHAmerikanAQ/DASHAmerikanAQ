- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Previously on Keeping Up with the Kardashians... ♫ We're in Montana ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Time to get our ski on. Yeah, baby! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I find it to be helpful sometimes to go to therapy. Now that everything going on with Bruce is out in the open with our family, we all want to make sure that Kendall and Kylie feel supported. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My big concern is just that I don't want my kids to emotionally go away. &gt;&gt; KIM: Both of you have a inferiority complex. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get your head out of everybody else's ass, and pay attention to your family trip. Get over yourself and all your little people. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're such a bitch. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you stupid?! It's ajoke! Yo. This is not theway to drive acar! What theis wrong with you?! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh... &gt;&gt; SCOTT:idiot! I got to get all of us killed? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, you're driving, like, crazy. Scott, you're driving, like, crazy. Well, where are we going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT:could have literallytaken our whole car out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott has had some anger issues in the past, but we were also in a really scary situation. Lately, he's been in a really positive mood, so I'm hoping that this was just because we almost had a horrible car accident and that he still continues to feel good. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We literally could have been crushed between the two, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: For real. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's the crazy part, 'cause if she stopped and, like, we just, like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: ...And we had nowhere to go, you would've... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That truck wasn't gonna go anywhere but hit you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God, he could've ran us over. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. Then I looked back. It was done, but... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Your face got so red, by the way. I've never seen you red. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ugh, I just haven't got mad in a long time. I feel like it was good for me. This driver putting the people I love's lives in jeopardy just really hit a switch with me, and I didn't know how to react other than just to flip out. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Do you feel better? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. I'm not... It's scary, but it is what it is. You know, I've definitely been very calm, and I've really been trying to appreciate things and slow down a little bit. But, I mean, the last thing I'd want to do is lose anyone I care about. I would never be able to forgive myself. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I can't believe you spit on me. He spit on... He covered me, though. That's the crazy part. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. That's like Kim's body. Keeks? Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm trying to rest. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. It really does jiggle. Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like a massage. I just have such... like, I can't breathe in here. It's, like, the altitude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause it's the altitude. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I know you weren't gonna come to me. Um, so I just wanted to apologize for our fight. We've been getting along so well lately-- we don't need to be fighting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, do you really think that I think I'm better than you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course not. I know that Kim has been going through so much. She's been trying so hard to have a baby and is doing all her fertility treatments, and Kim and I wanted a positive trip to create new memories. No, the whole thing is fine. We have so many other huge, important things happening in our lives that we don't need to fight over this petty nonsense. And you're sorry for... &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know what I did. Saying you have bad style? But this outfit is not helping your case. This is, like, so bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My brother gave me this, and I'm very honored he bought me a sweat suit. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is really nice. You're such a nice sister to wear it. It's like when your kid makes something really ugly, and you have to, like, like it or wear it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna have to wear a macaroni necklace eventually. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but I wouldn't wear it in a sweat suit if I didn't have to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it's nice. I'm comfortable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want me to tell you the plan for tomorrow? &gt;&gt; MASON: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, in the morning, go skiing. You're gonna do a little bit more... &gt;&gt; MASON: Breakfast. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, breakfast. Then get ready. Then ski. &gt;&gt; KIM:Did you hear that? Did you hear that? Hold on. Say that again. Say that again. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: You my mommy. &gt;&gt; KIM: She said, "You're my mommy." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? That's your mommy? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it's really fun that we can come here and just kind of forget about everything and all the stress that's back home. To see all of our kids play together, they remind me of how me, Kourtney and Khloe and Rob were, growing up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What happened to me? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: It's my mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Aw, I thought you said I was your mom. I know what it was like just to have that closeness and that bond with my sisters, and I want to have a second baby and have a sibling for North. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, get him! I have 2% battery. Get North, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: I got you! I got you! I got you. I am throwing him in the snow! One... two... three! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. Well, I'm happy to be here. And everyone is so amazing and nice. Just arrived in London to present an award at the Brit Awards. Mel! Where are you planted these days? &gt;&gt; MEL B.: L.A. I flip from here and L.A. and Australia. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are you going from here? &gt;&gt; MEL B.: Home then I come back next week to shoot a commercial. What are you doing? You're a busy lady always. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. Well, I'm going to Paris tom... day after tomorrow. Kendall's... For Couture Week. &gt;&gt; MEL B.: Oh. Wow. Gosh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know that this is a real emotional, challenging time right now, for my kids, while all of this is going on with Bruce. And right after this, I'm going to Paris to meet Kendall, because we have work to do. I'm really happy about that, because then we can be there for each other and I can just try to be a source of comfort. Thank you. Well, hello, London. And the National Television Award goes to... Celebrity Juice. I look at a big crowd like this, and I can't help but wonder what everyone's reaction will be when they hear about what's going on with Bruce. My wish and my prayer is just that everyone will be kind and accepting. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: I'm-I'm doing a sketch The Kardashians. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I love it. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: And my mum, my real mum, plays you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love it. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: So bizarre. The Kardashians?" The Kardashians." The Kardashians. Then you've got to pretend to be her." "Okay." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. All right. Well, see? There you go. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your mom's got a good sense of humor. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; CARY: Pleased to meet you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm Kim. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; CARY: Come on back. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have done pretty much everything you can do to try and get pregnant. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: These are ovulation sticks. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've been having sex 500 times a day. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Wendy will give you the shots. &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: We're basically looking inside the uterus today, so if you have a retained placenta, I'm gonna take it out. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have to check your ovulation, your levels. So I had to find a doctor and a lab out here that was a fertility specialist. &gt;&gt; CARY: Try not to be nervous. &gt;&gt; KIM: So far nothing has worked, so it's really frustrating and I'm starting to wonder if it's just easier to give up. I have had this issue with my uterus. I've done IVF, and it didn't work. I called John Edward. I do really trust his opinion. &gt;&gt; JOHN: I don't know. I'm not seeing you conceiving. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. Look who's here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everything is happening really quickly. I'm now thinking, when was the last time I took a picture with the Bruce that I grew up with for 25 years? &gt;&gt; KIM: How far away are we? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, we're sliding. Khloe. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Oh, my God, I don't have my seatbelt on! Holy! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa. What are you gonna do with that? You gonna build a snowman? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, build him up here. That's his head? Whoa. Whoa. His boots don't look like they have much traction. &gt;&gt; MASON: Ready? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, Marty. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT:That was awesome. Oh, get it. Yeah. I haven't lost control of my anger in a while, and maybe it's been a little bottled up and maybe I took it out on this driver, but I'm definitely very appreciative of this trip and it's really opened my eyes to see how nice life can be when you appreciate it and I'm hoping to take this newfound respect for life back to L.A. and really enjoy what I have, because I do have an amazing life and I want to appreciate it and... live up every moment I can, before it's gone. &gt;&gt; MASON: More snow. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's everywhere. Thank you. I appreciated that one. "oui," in French, O-U-I? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She also... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know why I'm really asking you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have a very big insecurity about "angel" and "angle." I was playing Pictionary when I was 15 years old with the entire Jackson family, including Janet. I was like, "Yes, I got a good word, it's easy, I got this." And I'm writing an angel and Jermaine and Janet and they're all jumping up, like, "Wings," you know, "Halo, angel!" And I'm like, "Yes, you got it." But the other team sees the card and they're like, "Kim, it's 'angle', not 'angel', but "we'll give you the point. We feel so bad for you." &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I literally wanted to die. Oh, my God, Kourtney and I are the masters of gin. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, well, this is no fun, then. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's what my grandma played. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where's Scott-- why don't we ask him to play with us? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He should, but I think he's tired. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I mean, he's been good, except that rage that he had with that crazy driver. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. But you know what? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: When he spit on me like alunatic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, but I talked to him about it. He brought it up to me and was like, "I feel really bad about the whole thing." And I'm like, "Well, I mean, it was a scary situation." He's like, "No, I feel really bad that I went off like that, but, like, I looked to my rearview mirror and saw this 16-wheeler coming at me and with you three in the back seat would have literally died." &gt;&gt; KIM: That's really scary. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But he, um, has been much better, but I hope that he sticks with it, 'cause I think that has to do with what you... do after, you know? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can really see so many positive changes in Scott's behavior lately, and I know that Scott feels really bad about getting out of control, but, you know, he really thought we could have died and that the three of us in the back seat, like, would not have survived the car accident, and I get it. It was a really crazy, scary situation. Gin. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom won, again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, two, two, two, and four, five, six. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I literally have nothing, I... &gt;&gt; MASON: Kiki has to win. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What about me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah! &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Look at the little moon sliver. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So pretty. Such a beautiful city. I want to go shopping tomorrow. Kendall gets here tomorrow. So exciting. Oh, there's the Givenchy where Kim had her wedding dress designed. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: There's Kendall. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't Kendall right there in the ad? &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Yeah, she's on the wall. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, crazy. Nothing is more beautiful than Paris. And on the side of a building is the ad campaign for Givenchy, starring Kendall Jenner. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Supermodel. She's everywhere. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so proud of her. And I think this'll be a great time for Kendall and I to spend some time together. So exciting. Oh, wow, my daughter's on a wall. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you our waitress? &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Yes, I am. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can I order something, 'cause we're in a... kind of a rush. Um, can I get the tuna tartare, please? &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Sure, sounds good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want the spicy tomato penne? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. Oh, my God, I'm so tired. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But your flight was good? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a cute hat. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you excited about the Chanel show? I brought my gloves that he gave me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I saw. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wear 'em to the show. I know it must be really difficult for the kids, especially Kendall and Kylie. And I'm gonna be here just in case she needs somebody to talk to. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why is this so spicy today? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It always is. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I hate spicy food. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're just tired. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I, at the age of 65, am starting a new chapter in my life. I have made some decisions that I'm so excited about but, also, a little nervous about. I've just bought my first home. Now, I've had lots of houses throughout my life, but I've never been in charge of actually buying the house. You always send your wife off-- "Okay, go find a house"-- and then she invites you in when she's done decorating. This house is actually all mine, and I absolutely love it. Paparazzis, they're everywhere. And I know when I open up about my life, it might be worse. Probably one of the more difficult things you can go through in life is having people stalk you all day long. This new house is on a private road, so I'm hoping for a lot of privacy, because it's my only little sanctuary that I have in life. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're going to Fashion Week? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why? Why are you following me everywhere? That's, like, my times when I get away from home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm dead serious. That's so annoying. &gt;&gt; KIM: Basically, I have had this issue with my uterus. &gt;&gt; JOHN EDWARD: Yeah. I mean, not seeing you conceiving. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm looking for any kind of positive answer. Like, I'm just exhausted. I don't know how much longer I can go through with this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, tell me when you're ready. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Make sure the snow looks cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I'll control the snow. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're supposed to go when I'm laughing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, okay. Laugh. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Now I don't want to laugh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim's gonna be so jealous. One, two, three. There's definitely highs and lows of this trip, but let's finish this trip on a great, fun, high note. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Take one of us like this. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, people are gonna make fun of me and say I'm... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Kylie, you shut up. One, two... three. Oh, there you go. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, you're back. There you go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like we just have to support each other, as we're all adjusting to our new family dynamic. Where do we have to sit? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: In between both my girls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And a little Malika on the side. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You look in a good mood-- you're all... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, I'm having a great time here. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I can't keep up with you right now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nobody can. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He loves, um, the mountains. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Is that what it is? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Makes me feel better. I love the country. I want to get out of the city. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're not in the city-- you live in Calabasas. It's almost the same thing without snow. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's true. Oh, we gettin' toasty! Salty! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone, I just want to say that I am so thankful. This has been a crazy year, with Mom and Bruce and everything else, and I think it's really important for us to have our traditions and keep our family close. And even though Mom and Bruce couldn't be here, I love that the kids still get to do this stuff and we get to create our own memories. 'Cause we have all of our Vail memories, and the kids need to have theirs. &gt;&gt; KIM: This trip, I think, was really good for the family and really good for all of the older kids to show that we can take our kids now and carry on these traditions that we had when we were children. And it was just really what the family needed, to just kind of get away and be together, and just know that at the end of the day, we still have each other, and we're all okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so thankful for Kimberly Kardashian West because without her, this family vacay never would have happened. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Or our careers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Or our careers. Cheers to Kim Kardashian West, everyone. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: KKW. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's the next thing you have after this, when you go home, besides the concert? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um, I have a shoot, like, a day after that. shoot, that's out right now, is so beautiful. Those... I love you with bangs like that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I literally... People would text me and be, like, "Bangs is your thing." And I'm, like, "No." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what's going on with Kendall, but I can only imagine that everyone's nerves are on edge. And I just want to be here, just in case she needs somebody to talk to. Do you know who Twiggy is? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who? She just got the L'Oreal campaign. She's 65 years old. I'm thinking there's hope. I'm excited for, like, regular Fashion Week. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're going to Fashion Week? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why? Why are you following me everywhere? That's, like, my-my time to, like, get away from home. I'm dead serious. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, do you understand? That's so weird to me. I'm dead serious, that's so annoying. London is short, London is quiet, London is, like, my... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I got it. All right. Maybe I'll just go to London and do business and I won't even go... I won't even talk to you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My mom wants to make sure everything is perfect, but sometimes she just needs to let me do my own thing and live a little. Even though things are changing, I think we're both kind of going through these emotions and still working through them the best we can. Being able to work all the time and travel kind of keeps my mind off of it for the time being. And I don't think she understands that I can do it on my own now. I'm, like, home all the time. These are, like, the times when I go away. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so proud of Kendall. I think she's doing a lot better than I actually expected. And it's hard because I love being wanted and needed and having a purpose in my life. And I think at first I tried to convince myself that I was actually coming here to make sure Kendall was okay, and now I'm realizing that it's a little for me, too. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Let me miss you. You're not letting me miss you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Am I too needy? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's way too needy, Mom. Like, you're obsessed with me. It's kind of annoying. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You do? Why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get away from all that Hollywood nonsense and breathe this crisp air every day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would like to. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I have to call this guy back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who, Johnny? Wait, let's hear this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Shh. How are you? &gt;&gt; JOHN EDWARD: I'm good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm good. I called John Edward. I've been friends with him for a long time. &gt;&gt; JOHN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; JOHN: How you doing? I'm gonna jump in right now. Do you have a father-in-law or an older male that would be like uncle who passed from cancer? &gt;&gt; KIM: Our dad passed from cancer. &gt;&gt; JOHN: I-I feel like you need to know Dad's okay, and I feel like you need to know that he will continue to be a connection to your lives. &gt;&gt; KIM: I do really trust his opinion, and I obviously want to hear positive response. You know how you said to me when I was like, "Am I pregnant?" and you were like, "No, I see the number three," and you were like, "Three months or three years," and I was like, "I can't wait till she's three years old, she's, like, one and a half." You know? So basically, I have had this issue with my uterus. So, I was going to... I've done IVF and it didn't work. And I have the option to do... &gt;&gt; JOHN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...another transfer or do a little biopsy that they think I need before I do another transfer, since it hasn't worked, and I just wanted to know, what was that three? Like, should I do a transfer? &gt;&gt; JOHN: I think you're probably gonna do the biopsy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JOHN: I think you need to do that, just-just for health reasons that I'm telling you that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JOHN: Um... I don't know. Not seeing you conceiving. It's just a hard time. &gt;&gt; KIM: My heart just kind of sinks. I'm looking for any kind of positive answer to kind of push me along with this journey. I'm just, like, exhausted. I don't know how much longer I can go through with this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Most of the time I'm alone... so it's different. It gives you this new, like, "Okay, what am I gonna do with the rest of my life?" &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoa, we're sliding. Khloe! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: This car was coming towards us. : I thought I was, like, gonna die. &gt;&gt; JOHN: I don't know. Not seeing you conceiving. It's just a hard time. You can't psychologically dwell on conception and fertility. What you need to do is visualize walking with a child. You need to see your daughter playing with the child. &gt;&gt; KIM: John just feels like I'm putting too much negative energy and stressful energy into trying to get pregnant. &gt;&gt; JOHN: Think about it in terms of your body, and when is the right time, energetically. And then also, whatever energy is coming in to have you as his mom and Kanye as his dad has to have a certain set of circumstances, and astrologically, it's got to be the right time for that child to come in. You know, do what the doctor is telling you. Do it the old-fashioned way. Do it with their help. Just know that it's going to happen and allow it to happen. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, so frustrating. I need to just relax, visualize it, and it'll happen. It's something that I want so bad. All right, well, I'll call you either next time I'm in New York, or next time you're in L.A., call me. &gt;&gt; JOHN: You got it. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I'll talk to you soon. Bye. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hello. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel really good, because I got to see for myself that Kendall's doing well and she's working hard. So while I'm here, I'm gonna have dinner with some friends and enjoy Paris a little bit. I'm so glad you guys were free. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: How long are you going to stay in Paris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just a few days, 'cause Kendall's walking Chanel. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: She's just a supermodel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't it so great? &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: How is your life, you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: Good? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. It feels, like, really... good. You know? Kim and Kanye just moved out... about three weeks ago. &gt;&gt; NICHOLAS: Because they were living with you, too? &gt;&gt; KRIS: For two years. &gt;&gt; NICHOLAS: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: I didn't know that. &gt;&gt; NICHOLAS: How did you put up with this? &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: You were doing a lot that I didn't know about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. It was like Downton Abbey. But it's so crazy, because I... live in my house and Kylie is the last kid, so she's gonna move in a couple of months, and I... you know, and most of the time I'm alone. So it's different. It gives you this new, like, "Okay, what am I gonna do with the rest of my life?" &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: Maybe you can come more often to Paris to see your old friends. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, there you go. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: You know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I feel so completely blessed that all of my children seem to be doing just great. And I am still trying to digest the fact that, as much as I hate change in my life, it's always changing. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: I will see if I can find some, uh... handsome guys around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh! French lovers! That's what we need. &gt;&gt; NICHOLAS: Are you single, too? &gt;&gt; MAN: I am, but I already have a French lover. &gt;&gt; NICHOLAS: Okay, so... okay, we don't have to deal with you, then. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: Boring. &gt;&gt; NORTH: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye-bye. It used to be all my hair. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Damn. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Started bleaching it. What, you want to leave? Let's leave. Got to get my &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh! Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: I have an appointment within, like, 30 minutes from when I land. I have to race over to the doctor and get my blood drawn before the lab closes. So, I'm really annoyed that everyone is taking forever. Everyone is, like, almost an hour behind schedule. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:yeah! We're here! Good morning, Montana! &gt;&gt; KIM: I-I've just put too much time into this to miss this appointment and then have to be set back a whole, another month. Guys, this isn't funny. I have an appointment as soon as we land! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes, we're trying to figure out what car we're in. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tell everyone to get in the car so we can go. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Calm down! You're, you're giving me a headache! &gt;&gt; KIM: No! No! We're already 15 minutes past... and Kourtney's not even in the car. We're leaving! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This bitch is crazy. I know she's anxious to get home, anxious to get to her fertility appointment. I totally get it. But let's not finish the trip this way-- rushing and stressing everybody out. She can't be yelling at every single one of us. So, I decide I'm gonna take Kim to the airport so everyone can stop being barked at and we could be on our way and Kourtney and the family will be a few minutes behind us. &gt;&gt; KIM: How far away are we? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Six miles, I think. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I wonder how cold that water is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. It is really snowing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Could've gone on that last run. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Could've. That is so not safe for people to do. I would love to horseback ride in the snow. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've never done that before. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, my dad, like, his property or whatever... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In Malibu? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, he's gonna flatten the land and pay for, like, a stable and everything... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How awesome! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...if me and Kendall, like, buy our own horses. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How awesome. Horses aren't expensive. It's, like, the taking care of it, 'cause you have to have someone, like, clean it all the time, feed them... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I don't know how much that is, but... knowing your dad, he might want to do that himself. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like... Whoa! &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoa, we're sliding, Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not my fault! Not my fault! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I don't have my seatbelt on! Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Horses aren't expensive. It's, like, the taking care of it, 'cause you have to have someone, like, clean it all the time, feed them... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like... whoa! &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoa, we're sliding, Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not my fault! Not my fault! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I don't have my seatbelt on! Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Fine. We're fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, why are you freaking out? I didn't do anything! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're fine, we're fine, we're fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I know, but this is reallyscary! And we should not be driving like this! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Snow plows have come to try to clean off the roads. And they've already got snow all on our windshield. And then all of a sudden, a big 18 wheeler gets snow all over us and it kind of jolts our car onto black ice. And I don't know how, but the car spun, went into oncoming traffic and we ended up in a ditch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't freak out. Don't freak out. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's scary. I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You should always have your seatbelt on. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Don't cry in front of her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I tried my best... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, it's not your fault; it's black, it's, like, black ice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know how else to handle that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: The car's, like, stuck in a ditch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was the scariest thing ever. &gt;&gt; KIM: We just skidded, like, off the side of the road. And then get into a ditch and it was so scary. And I didn't have my seatbelt on, so I thought I was, like, gonna die. Our car's stuck, like, in the snow in the middle of... I mean, in a ditch, off the side of the road. I, like, we skidded into the other side of the road and a car was, like, coming towards us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We almost flipped our car; we flew off the road. We're on the side of the road right now. Terrifying. When stuff like this happens, it makes you put everything into perspective-- life, family, friends-- what's important to you. Things could change in a blink of an eye. Our family has learned that tons of times. We definitely have angels surrounding us today. That was really scary. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Driving in those conditions are treacherous! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We all got to say a prayer before we take off, everyone! Everybody say a prayer. Close your eyes and say, "Dear Lord..." &gt;&gt; MASON: I pray that everything is nice in the world. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; MASON: And everything is good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And everybody please protect us on our plane ride home, in Jesus' name. Amen! &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, I'm in the kitchen! &gt;&gt; KIM: Smells good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just made brownies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, that's nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. So, what in the world happened in Montana? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, we had a great trip. Like, skiing was great. Like, we had this entire mountain to ourselves. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. But that accident. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I just get over it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, Khloe literally saved our lives. I could've died. Like, I didn't have a seatbelt on. We fully all could've died. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, we were just like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wish I would've been there with you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but Bruce just called me and was like, "All these weird things keep on happening." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, well... &gt;&gt; KIM: Your guys' accident... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like we're so lucky and blessed. You have to live every day to the fullest and really appreciate everything that you have, especially your health. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was thinking that yesterday. I mean, there's just been so many scary things that have happened. Like, our car accident at the end just makes you really grateful and thankful just to be healthy and that everyone's okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It makes you really appreciate the little things. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You have a tiny bit of fluid on the inside. Do you see that black there? &gt;&gt; KIM: It just doesn't look like good news is coming my way. At some point, you become so exhausted. I don't really care what the results are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you guys talked to Bruce? Did you hear he's having the surgery this week? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm now thinking in my head when was the last time I took a picture with the Bruce that I grew up with for 25 years? &gt;&gt; HUANG: Good morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good morning. &gt;&gt; HUANG: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; HUANG: It's good to see you. Good morning, good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; HUANG: All right, so before we get started, I just want to kind of explain, one more time, kind of what we're doing, okay? Um, so we've already looked inside your uterus, all right? So we made sure that, inside your uterus, everything looks perfect, okay? Um, but the question is why did we place the embryo and you didn't get pregnant? So I want to make sure that inside, at the cellular level, everything's perfect as well, okay? So today we're gonna do a biopsy. It'll be a little bit crampy, okay? So thank your mom for being here. Um, so we're gonna do a biopsy, take out a little bit of tissue and then we're done, all right? We know you can get pregnant, but has anything changed between that pregnancy and today? Uh, and that's what we're trying to find out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's just do it and get it over with. &gt;&gt; HUANG: Yeah, you got it. Okay. A little bit of pressure. All right, Kim, you okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; HUANG: All right, let's have a look. So, here's your uterus, okay? And here's your lining. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am getting a biopsy now, because since IVF did not work for me, they want to try and pinpoint why it didn't work for me. &gt;&gt; HUANG: So, I'm putting a little bit of pressure right now okay? Spread for me, okay? Relax your knees a tiny bit for me. Mom, are you holding her hand? Just a little bit of cramping, okay, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM:Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; HUANG: You're almost done, okay? You're doing great. &gt;&gt; KIM: &gt;&gt; KRIS: Breathe like you're... &gt;&gt; HUANG: Breathe, good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Deep breath. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's always something that's blocking me. And at this point, I'm just, like, exhausted. I don't know how much longer I can go through with this. &gt;&gt; HUANG: Okay, you're all done. Great job. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The Lord... So, okay, Kourtney was at a... ...a birthday breakfast today and so she was telling a story. This lady was holding someone's baby. She's breastfeeding, like, her own child, but she was holding a stranger's baby. And she said, "Can I breastfeed your baby?" And the mom said, "Sure!" So I said, is that not weird to people don't have kids? Because I find it weird. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did they do it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What?! Wait, that somebody would let somebody's kid suck on another bosom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And the mom had just fed her. She wasn't even hungry. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, it's the blondie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you like? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love the blonde hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, but why isn't it white anymore? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you mean? It's so white! &gt;&gt; KIM: It... I'm getting it done tonight. It's so annoying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think you look so good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I love it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are these riding pants you're wearing? And your new favorite boots-- I follow you on Instagram, so I hear what you say. &gt;&gt; KIM: Givenchy and Givenchy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And your bottom-- You have underboob, which is so cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're, like, really cool these days. Have you guys talked to Bruce? Did you hear he's having the surgery this week? Mm-hmm. Everything with Bruce is happening really quickly. I really can't believe that Bruce is having facial feminization surgery. And I'm now thinking in my head, when was the last time I took a picture with the Bruce that I grew up with for 25 years? &gt;&gt; ROSEN: Kim? Knock, knock. Dr. Rosen. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; ROSEN: You're blonde today. You look lovely. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yes, I am blonde. So today we're just checking to see how close I am to ovulating? &gt;&gt; ROSEN: Correct. When you were here a few days ago, the follicle was still small. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROSEN: So we just want to make sure that it's growing. The first thing I always do, every time, is look at the uterus. Still a tiny bit of fluid on the inside. You see that black there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ROSEN: And there's your follicle. Can you see that black hole right there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ROSEN: Great. This is in your left ovary. The earliest you're gonna ovulate is about four days from today, which is about, what? Saturday or so? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROSEN: So we should probably see you back Friday, so we can figure out when we give you that trigger shot. And if we're gonna do a transfer, if the biopsy comes back good, that will be about... six days after the... after the injection. Questions? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I'm, like, so over it. Like, I'm exhausted. So, I'm sure everyone gets to that point. But, yeah. I'm, like, okay, I'm done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do I hear somebody? Oh, my God. Look who's here. How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So many things are changing, but my love and how I respect Bruce-- that will never go anywhere. So I want to say "hi" to Bruce and get my last visual of him that I want without some major physical changes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's the ocean. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. How relaxing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And we can see, like, Kylie, who, of course, is late. We can see her coming up the hill. But there's just five homes on this road. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you like it out here? Sleeping out here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love it here. Yeah. It's the best. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, it's so pretty. This is like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So secluded, so quiet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...so peaceful. Bruce and I have always had such an incredible, close relationship. I'm always gonna worry about Bruce and no matter what, I love him and he will always be my father figure. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll show you. I took some pictures of the... the sunrises, the other morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll show 'em to you when we go inside. They're on my phone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you see whales from here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, you can. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you seen one? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bunch of 'em. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're actually going south right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I kind of want to see one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. You have to kind of sit here and wait. But they're out there. They're running south right now. Oh, look who shows up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, buddy! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does he get jealous that you hold the new one all the time? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes, he was being so... Hi! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You walked right by my little flower. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: As soon as I got back, I really wanted to go visit my dad. He's making a lot of changes, but no matter how much his exterior changes, our souls are always as connected. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So you survived Montana... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...barely. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I survived it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know, but they had the-the little car crash and the whole thing and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one crashed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You just spun off the road? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Into a snowbank? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it was scary, for sure. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did Kris go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. It was just us, like, kids. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just all the kids? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall's calling me. Let's put her on speakerphone. Hey, babe. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey, sister! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kendie! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, we miss you! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where are you guys? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Malibu, at Dad's house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, are you excited to be home? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I will. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um, yeah. I'm super excited. I'm only here for a week, but I'm trying to make the most of it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, a week's better than nothing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You gotta come out here and see the place. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, no, for sure. Maybe tomorrow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. You got it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: All right, love you, bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, anyway, thank you guys for coming over, seeing the house. Love you guys. Come on, give me a hug. Let's get the dog in here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, wrong person. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, buddy. All right, good for you guys. Come on, come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, good for you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A little... with the hug, with the dog. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, make sure. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everybody in here with the hug. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mmm... Love you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thanks for coming out. I love to share moments like this with all my kids, now in my new home, because, you know, it does kind of represent a new chapter in my life and I'm looking forward to the future and I can't wait to share that with my family. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Welcome to our meal, ladies. &gt;&gt; MAN: What happened? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is happening? They're circling Kim's house, I think. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was the first time I saw Bruce as "her." Really, really pretty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We just switched Kylie's birth control pill. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you take it for your skin? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What, do you think she has a "pregnant" sweater? &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that Lamar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're, like, flirting with him and called off your whole divorce? I just can't take it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, good, you don't have to. &gt;&gt; NURSE: This little circle, that's exactly what you want to see. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just got the blood test back. I am pregnant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! Also coming soon, the DASH Dolls. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are now relaunching our DASH store. We just want to make sure that we have the best DASH Dolls. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: I'm gonna make organizing freaks out of you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Focus on this first, and you won't be back. &gt;&gt; DASH DOLL: I'm ready for a hot tub. &gt;&gt; DASH DOLL 2: What you drinking? &gt;&gt; TAYLOR: Raunchy! &gt;&gt; NAZY: Did you guys ever eat glue when you were a kid? &gt;&gt; DURRANI: Yes, did you? &gt;&gt; NAZY: No. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: I am, like, a resident deejay at Trap Night. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I don't know what "trap" is. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: Literally, every second getting arrested. My boyfriend is about to re-up. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: You have a right to do something else. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: All I ever envisioned was having a career with her. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: What do you want me to do? "Sorry I got married, sorry I had kids"? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: How could you affect someone else with your actions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guess who could get the lawsuit? We would. I will let someone go in two seconds. &gt;&gt; DURRANI: No one's appreciating anything I do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Some people have to get cut.
