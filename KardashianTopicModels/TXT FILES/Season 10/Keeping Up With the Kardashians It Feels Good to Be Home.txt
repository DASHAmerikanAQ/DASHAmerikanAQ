- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm trying to pack for Armenia. It's always been in our plans to go to Armenia one day. It was super important to my dad. You, me, North and Kanye are gonna rule that town. They're so excited to have Kim here. &gt;&gt; PASCAL: We should move, because people are getting wild. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Pascal! My own security should not leave me behind. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: People still treat me as if I don't know what's going on. I've been spending a lot of time with Dad, actually. But I don't want to hurt Mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you feeling? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a little... sad. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom is having a really emotional time, dealing with Caitlyn's transition. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had such a day yesterday. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh. &gt;&gt; NORTH: Mama. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; NORTH: Mama. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, the yummy food. Oh, good, it's lavash. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. Mmm. Oh, my God, Kendall's on the Harper's Bazaar? &gt;&gt; KIM: Let me see. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kimberly, she's a real model. Being in Armenia, I miss being with my sisters and I see my mom posted a picture of Kendall Harper's Bazaar. I wish she was here, but I just miss her and she's just some big supermodel. What up, ho? Wait, you're on the cover of Harper's Bazaar? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ken, good job. &gt;&gt; KIM: Congrats, K. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thanks. How's Armenia? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's insane. It's so much fun. Look at the homemade la... Oh, wait, I'm gonna show Kendall. You know the lavash we eat at home? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look. You're gonna die. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Watch. And they put it in this hole and look, that's the lavash, then watch. This is, like, fresh lavash. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? This is insane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; ARPI: Look at the cross in the mountain. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; ARPI: The church is a part of this whole thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, wow. Mount Ararat, that we drove by, that huge mountain, that's in the Bible, where it says Noah's ark landed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: North, look. &gt;&gt; KIM: For the last day of our trip in Armenia, I heard that there is this amazing monastery in this cave and it's really special to go to, and I'm really excited to go with the whole family. &gt;&gt; ARPI: Father. This is Kim Kardashian West, Mr. West and Khloe Kardashian. &gt;&gt; PRIEST: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say hi, Northie. And this is North. Say hi. &gt;&gt; ARPI: In order to go into the church, we usually cover our heads. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, this is crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh, it's so pretty. &gt;&gt; ARPI: This was built in 1215, and this is the main area where they, uh, they used to do celebrations. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can tell that Kanye is loving this bishop's whole getup that he has going on. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if I see this in Kanye's next show. Kanye's smile is literally contagious, so when I see him grinning from ear to ear, I mean, I start smiling, and now this bishop is gonna think I'm either flirting with him or making fun of him, and that's just awkward. &gt;&gt; ARPI: At some point, in the 14th and 15th centuries, this was a music school. And until today, people continuously sing. They would like to perform for you, so that you would hear the acoustics. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're going to light a candle, Northie. Look. We're gonna light it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's put all of ours together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's been so amazing to have Kanye with us while we get to know more about our culture, our history. I just feel so blessed. So the next part of our trip is heading to Jerusalem to baptize North. Okay, let's go. Let's go, Bubba. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, Mase. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, you're not gonna be here for our DASH party. I was gonna say, do you even want to come? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, I leave whatever day the 17th is. I think that's Sunday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you ever get homesick when you travel? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God-- no, I used to, when I was, like, a kid. I didn't even want to sleep over at friends' houses. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you leave Friday? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I come home that night, and then I leave again that night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, where do you go on the 17th? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: To Vegas, for Billboard. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know that Kendall has been working a lot. Caitlyn transitioning isn't some kind of common thing that our family is going through, so I just really want to check in with Kendall and see how she's doing. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The other night... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie texted me. Like, we were all at Mom's, and she was like, "What are you doing tonight? Can I come out to the city? Can I come hang out with you or whatever?" And I was like, "No, I leave tonight." And she was like, "You're never around anymore." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm home for, like, a day and then I go to Brazil. My life-- I basically live on a plane. When I get, like, a minute off, I don't really know what to do with myself. It's kind of weird for my family to, like, not have me around as much, but at the same time, with what's going on at home, I really only want to worry about my professional life. &gt;&gt; MASON: I eat the rest! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're gonna eat all of that? I'd like to see you try. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're gonna eat all that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, that's really hot. Why wouldn't you warn me? &gt;&gt; KANYE: Armenia, how you doing tonight? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I was about to go to bed when Kanye came up with this idea to give a free concert to everyone here in Armenia. So he wakes me up, I'm in sweats with no makeup on, and we rush over to this park, and there must be thousands of people here. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Are y'all having a good time so far? Make some noise! Everybody in this joint, come on, I need everybody out here to start jumping up and down, soon as the beat drop. Are y'all ready? Yo, play it back! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I see Kanye notice this fan that jumped in the water. I could tell, like, what's going on in his mind, so I know he's gonna try something crazy. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: You can really feel the excitement in the air. It's such an amazing thing that he's doing for everyone here in Armenia. I think they just appreciate it so much. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KANYE: That's what my wife said! Feels good to be home! Feels good to be home! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We are leaving Armenia and now we are off to Jerusalem to get baby North baptized. &gt;&gt; PASCAL: I didn't even have to dry the clothes. Could have gone from the lake straight into the rain. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I saw the video. It looked great. I just wasn't invited. &gt;&gt; PASCAL: Yes, you were. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I found out from your post. I'm really irritated with Kim. I wasn't able to make that wonderful free mega-concert, because no one told me about it. I mean, it's one thing when, like, security forgets me. It's like, geez, whatever. It's another thing when my own sister forgets to invite me. It looked awesome. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just really excited to baptize my daughter. It's just an experience that we'll never forget. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't realize that the Billboard night, like, that's the same night that the special comes out. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. The only thing is I haven't met her, so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't either. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's something to get used to for sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is something you, like, wore on a date with my mom? I really hope that when I give these clothes to my mom, it'll bring some closure. I wanted to give you these things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It smells like him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What happened to your thumb? &gt;&gt; KANYE: I, like, fell in the lake and it was, like, bleeding. So, it was a little rock star injury. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you get stitches or just a Band-Aid? &gt;&gt; KANYE: It's a Band-Aid. I hope I don't need stitches. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, guys. We're on our way to Jerusalem to baptize North in the Armenian Quarter, which is such a dream of mine. I know Khloe's still upset from last night, but I texted her and she just didn't respond. So I'm just not gonna feed into any other drama. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so beautiful. Being in Jerusalem in such a holy place is very calm and spiritual. I decide I'm not gonna let that concert ruin my trip. I'm gonna put my feelings aside and focus on why we are here: to baptize North. I'm gonna channel my inner holiness and move on. &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you for having us. &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome, welcome. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye and I have always talked about baptizing our daughter, and when I mentioned that we were gonna be in Armenia, which was really close to Jerusalem, I think he, you know, thought there's no better place than in the Armenian church in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; PATRIARCH: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; PATRIARCH: Welcome to Jerusalem; please, have a seat. Is this your first visit to Jerusalem? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; PATRIARCH: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; MAN: These are the Armenian cookies. These are with, uh, nuts and these are with dates. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, you want cookie? What do you say? Say thank you. &gt;&gt; NORTH: Thank you. &gt;&gt; PATRIARCH: How about you? Why don't you try it? Help yourself, please. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I'm a big mess when I eat. &gt;&gt; PATRIARCH: Try it. You'll like it. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I don't want to get dirty before she gets baptized. &gt;&gt; KIM: We'll take some on the way out. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I'm just gonna take the whole plate and just gonna go like this. That'll happen, sure. &gt;&gt; MAN: We are ready. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow, this is so pretty. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: We are baptizing North in the oldest Armenian church in Jerusalem-- the St. James Church. North, you excited? I'm just really excited that I'm gonna be able to baptize my daughter while I'm pregnant. It's just an experience that we'll never forget. &gt;&gt; PRIEST: It gives us profound happiness that North West is going to be baptized in the most ancient Armenian church in Jerusalem. We are now going to start the service. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel really blessed that I'm a part of this experience. I'm honored and just completely over the moon that I get to be Baby North's godmother and witness this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bubba, look. You're gonna go in the water. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good job. Good job, Northie. You're all done. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think this is probably the most meaningful trip I've ever been on-- going to my homeland in Armenia and then Jerusalem. I'm so glad we got to really realize this dream of our dad's. I really wish the whole family could be here, but I think that it's okay. Like, we'll be able to share all these pictures and video that we're taking and share the way that she was baptized in the Armenian culture. &gt;&gt; PRIEST: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; PRIEST: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tell me if you know what the Tower of David is, which one. &gt;&gt; KIM: I do not... That tower right there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This one. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's pretty cool. I just want to know where Jesus walked and take those paths. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think all over here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But he wasn't, like, up here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, he wasn't on this balcony. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to walk on, like, his same path. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I don't know if that st-stone is still there. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, let's go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Our trip has been just absolutely incredible. It's time for us to leave, but I feel like I've learned so much. And that is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity I will never forget. Is Yeezus ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, let's go grab him. &gt;&gt; MAN: We hope you enjoyed your stay at the David Citadel Hotel. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you, guys. It's been so awesome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so nauseous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Drink? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, I'm a... I would love... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I-I don't need a whole life story; just yes or no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, a little baby one, thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was a... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was gonna give you a whole thing about how I was so nauseous... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was a lot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm making a piece of toast with avocado. Does anyone want one? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You eat the blandest food... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's delicious. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And she tries to expect me to eat... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How is that bland? With a little sea salt and olive oil? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She wants us all to get on her gravy train. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just reminded me I have hard-boiled eggs. I'm expanding my lunch today. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, well, don't-don't over... don't-don't go nuts. That's lunch and dinner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now you're getting really crazy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're gonna explode. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, maybe. I don't think that your piano looks great in that room anymore. Maybe I'll just take it back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-mm. Mason takes lessons on it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna use the grandson card? I'm really having a tough time lately, so I really want to start focusing on doing really positive things in my life. I've decided to take piano lessons, because Kim's taking lessons and I thought maybe we could do it together. It could be a really cool little bonding thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you can play me one song... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...I'll have the conversation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can you play a song? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you gonna play? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, I haven't done this in a really long time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know that my mom is going through a hard time and I'm sure that she would love to use this as one of her distractions. I love her and she can come to my house anytime and use my piano. I'll play a song for you. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'll give you $100 if you can play "Mary Had a Little Lamb." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, watch out. (playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb") &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm, like, a self-taught genius, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I owe her money. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This girl is no joke. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aah! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I should get this removed, huh? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That bump? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, how do you have to remove that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Surgery. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't realize that the Billboard night, like, when we're doing all that press and everything, like, that's the same night that... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...the special comes out. Bruce's interview on Diane Sawyer came out recently, and the "About Bruce" special is about to come out this week. Our emotions are incredibly raw in this special, and I think it's high anxiety for all of us. Kendall's been all over the place. I think keeping herself busy and occupying herself is good, but I also think you do have to address your problems. How are you dealing with everything? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm all right. I feel like it's a process. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For sure. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's something to get used to for sure, but, um, the only thing is, I haven't met her, so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't either. I think that's a process as well. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, well, it's also a "letting go" thing. It's, like, when you officially meet her, it's like he's gone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think that's what I'm holding onto. That's why I-I've taken so long to meet her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At this point, Kendall and I have not met Caitlyn. I just feel like we all have to do things in our own time. I mean, this is hard for all of us, but Kendall says as soon as she meets Caitlyn, she's gonna feel like Bruce is gone forever, and I think that's really hard for her to understand. How's Kylie handling things? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's, like, fine. I don't know. I feel like she gives that "I don't care" attitude, but, like, she does care. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She definitely cares. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just think it's easier to, like, kind of suppress your emotions and just be like, "Whatever." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, totally. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, P. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Penelope's gonna sit with me and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...watch her lesson. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is, like, a true piano jacket. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, is Kim coming to this lesson? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think so. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe Kim flaked, today of all days. I really thought that we'd have a chance to hang out a little bit and talk. Right now, Kim is the easiest person for me to talk to, because she's at a really good place in her life and she's really grounded. She's just my sounding board. And I think that today I really needed a sounding board. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm kind of nervous. &gt;&gt; KIM: The Billboard Music Awards is the same night that Bruce's special comes out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And I'm just not ready to be asked about it. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Get ready for Kanye West! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom is tucked away in a back dressing room, being incredibly antisocial. I don't know why we drove an hour and a half to sit in someone's closet-- I have a better closet at home. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited for some frozen yogurt. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I asked Kim to come meet me today. We really haven't had Kim and Kylie time, so I just want to catch up with her. Um... &gt;&gt; KIM: You look cute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks. So... I'm kind of nervous about Billboard. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Because the episode comes out, and I'm just not ready to do interviews or be asked about it or anything. But Kendall will be there, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: First of all, all you have to say is just, "I'm not ready to answer any questions until, uh, you know, you watch it." But don't say it, like, cheesy, like, "You're gonna have to tune in." You can just say, "You know what, just, you know, watch it and see for yourself. I think we answer every question." I totally sympathize with her. She's 17, she doesn't want to have to answer these types of questions, but Kylie is there with Kendall, and they'll know how to handle it together, and they'll be a good team. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I guess I just still don't believe that, like, everybody knows. Like, when people ask me about it or talk about it... &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...I still feel like we all have been like... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, this secret. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...kept our mouth shut for so long. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. Obviously, everyone's gonna try to ask, but Kendall will be right there with you... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...so you guys, like, can play off of each other. That's how Khloe, Kourtney and I did it. Like, Kourtney never likes to talk, but if Khloe would get, like, stumbled on something, then I would jump in. Or if I wasn't in the mood, they would jump in, you know? But you shouldn't be nervous at all. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: I put way too many sprinkles in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I actually learned two songs today. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why does everyone want to take piano lessons since I take lessons? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because it's fun. And I did a really good job. Are you gonna say one word about the fact that you didn't show up? It's so rude. &gt;&gt; KIM: You text me, and you think that I can just show up. I have a full day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you just forgot. You have, like, selective memory. And I think when it's-it's important to you, you do everything you need to do, but when it comes to me and the things that mean something, you just kind of forget about it. I thought we would both enjoy it, and it would be a way to bond. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is gonna be a fun ride if you guys are just gonna do your selfies for two hours. How many more minutes? &gt;&gt; DRIVER: Now maybe, like, five miles... five miles to the exit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, five miles. Oh. &gt;&gt; DRIVER: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not bad at all. &gt;&gt; DRIVER: I'm doing 85, 90. There's no traffic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Got it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Five miles is not... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm just asking. I was just super nauseous. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel bad that my mom thinks that I flaked on her, so I decided to take her out to one of Kanye's concerts, and I think it could be what she needs right now. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Get ready for Kanye West! ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listening to Kanye's music, it's always wild fun. I'm excited to see my mom at a Kanye concert. I just want her to hang out and just let loose. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel bad, but I'm not really in the concert, party, happy mode. All I really want to do is put on my pajamas and crawl into bed and be by myself. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SERVER: Good? You need anything? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm good. Are you good? &gt;&gt; SERVER: Great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you find any friends to talk to? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, there's people out there, but, you know... Yowza, I don't know why we drove an hour and a half to sit in someone's closet. I have a better closet at home. My mom is tucked away in a back dressing room instead of going out into the stands and enjoying some music. I just want her to be present and in the moment. I'm really trying to do everything I can to pull her out of this funk, and nothing is working. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm getting super nervous and anxious, and Kendall is nowhere to be found. I am about to faint. &gt;&gt; KIM: All the girls in my family have been asked to be on Cosmo. My mom is really overwhelmed. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: If we can't provide what we promised, we're kind of at an impasse. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, we only have, like, 20 minutes. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I feel like these are more of, like, a gangster vibe. &gt;&gt; MAN: Gangster lash? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm getting ready for the red carpet, and Kendall is nowhere to be found, so I'm a little nervous. I, like, really might faint. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You have to go like this. Like, little. &gt;&gt; MAN: Excuse us, folks. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Are you gonna say hi to Kendall? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where are we going? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm part of the crew. I just wanted to fit in. &gt;&gt; MAN: Come on over, girls. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's kind of weird, 'cause Kylie and I usually do carpets together, but I'm actually with H&amp;M and Balmain, and I really only want to worry about that right now, 'cause that's what I'm here for. Am I not supposed to? Should I not take a photo with her? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yes, you can. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I totally understand that Kendall has these work obligations, but I'm getting super nervous and anxious about doing these interviews. I really wish Kendall was gonna be with me. I have, like, a few seconds before I faint. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I told them no questions about your lips and that if you started to feel uncomfortable about your dad, to move on, so... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, no. Now I feel too sick. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I feel like I'm really gonna faint. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Breathe. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I don't want to. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You can't now. Like, you're right there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm just gonna go now. Of course, I step up to do my first interview, and my stomach literally drops. It's too much. I can't do it. Kendall ditched me. I really needed her this time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you were literally by yourself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom, she's been in a funk and a fog lately. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so confused though, I really am, why we're doing BookCon when we don't even have a book yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, how are you feeling? &gt;&gt; KIM: I love your house. Thank God this rug is in now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, how did Billboard go? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, Kendall ditched me. She was supposed to do the interviews with me. And I was just like, "I don't know. I don't know. I can't do it. I'm sorry." And I just, like, walked off. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, I was, like, looking around for Kendall, and she wasn't there. I just didn't know what to say. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I feel like Kendall just probably assumes that you're so independent anyway. I don't think she purposely ditched you, and she was there with, like, H&amp;M, you know? I know that kind of sucks. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, she was doing her own thing. I was just, like, in the moment. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And I had a little attack. Me and Kendall have grown up like twins almost, so with everything that's happening with my dad, I really wish that Kendall was there with me. I just feel like Kendall's mostly there for me, but I really needed her this time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you were literally by yourself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Thank you so much! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw, don't cry, babe. &gt;&gt; GIRL: It's dream come true to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For me, too. Thank you. My mom signed me up to make an appearance at this BookCon event, even though my book is not out for almost six to eight more months. But... I've been trying to be nicer to her, 'cause I know all the stress she's under. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm at BookCon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so confused though, I really am, why we're doing BookCon when we don't even have a book yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, that is a very great question that me, Kim, Kourtney have all been wondering, but, you know, I go off of my manager's, um, advice and what she tells me to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS:Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, how are you feeling? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do not know what's going on with my arm, but I have this situation where I cannot use my right arm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are we gonna do to make Kris Jenner happier in life? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what would make me really happy, to be honest? A girl's night out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have noticed my mom, she's been in a funk and a fog lately, and I want her to get back to her happy Kris Jenner that I know her to be. Why don't we go back to Casa Vega and get some shots in us? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, deal. Well, have a good, um, book whatever you're doing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it, manager. You're great, since I know you don't know what I'm doing over here, 'cause I don't either. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, just put it on mymouth and I can go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe, we get it, you're hot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall, shut up. I don't come on the cover of and say that to you. &gt;&gt; KIM: All the girls in my family have been asked to be on Cosmo. It's a really big deal, 'cause this is an anniversary issue, it's a collector's item, and they're only printing a certain number of copies. Thank you so much for having us on. &gt;&gt; JOANNA: Are you kidding me? I think this is our third shoot together. I can't... I can't stop looking down here actually. What's the matter with me? &gt;&gt; KIM: They told me more skin, more skin. Cosmo. is... was my first big magazine that I ever did. &gt;&gt; JOANNA: Aw... &gt;&gt; KIM: And I had a publicist that I worked with that said, "So, like, what do you want your career to be?" And I said, "I just want to be one day." And she looked at me and goes, "Kim, let's be realistic. You're never gonna be on the Cosmo." &gt;&gt; JOANNA: How amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I was like, "Okay." 50th anniversary! &gt;&gt; JOANNA: 50th anniversary and cover. To many more, to many more, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: And now I got all my family members on the cover. &gt;&gt; JOANNA: I know, it's fantastic, it's fantastic. And it is, it really is like air traffic control getting you all together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I can't, um, do my own solo thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why not? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause I guess it's, like, a conflict with something that I already have. not happy about it though, but Mom handles everything, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: I understand my mom is really overwhelmed and she's dealing with a lot. The Caitlyn situation is causing so much anxiety that she's been all over the place lately. It keeps getting worse, and I just feel like something needs to change. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So I have no shot at this point of having Kendall on a front cover. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall on a single. The-the problem, if you will, was, uh, the contractual obligation she has with something else. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Right. I have a job to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I-I understand. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: And I need to deliver that for Joanna. So if we can't provide your fans/our readers with what we promised, we're kind of at an impasse. &gt;&gt; KIM: Caitlyn let me take this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I still have a long way to go before I can process all of this. That makes me really sad. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: If we can't provide your fans/our readers with what we promised, then we're kind of at an impasse. &gt;&gt; SERGIO: What if we made... what if we made the Kendall cover one of the subscription covers, so every subscriber would get it, but it's not on newsstand? &gt;&gt; LIZ: Let me go call him right now and run that idea past him. I need it in writing! &gt;&gt; SERGIO: You'll get it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You'll get it in writing. &gt;&gt; LIZ: I need it in writing before we start. &gt;&gt; SERGIO: We'll sign it in blood. &gt;&gt; LIZ: The option is this: we're gonna do U.S. only, subscription only, and it's the three girls. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Khloe, Kendall, Kylie. &gt;&gt; LIZ: ...Kendall and Kylie. &gt;&gt; SERGIO: Done. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Ah! Yeah! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am just... happy my mom figured something else out. But this is not like her. &gt;&gt; SERGIO: High-five. &gt;&gt; LIZ: So in writing right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is a very stressful job. &gt;&gt; SERGIO: I don't know how you've done it all these years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Me either. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay. Shooting. Yes. &gt;&gt; JOANNA: So interesting, seeing them all together, 'cause you see all the DNA, don't you? And they're all so beautiful, each one individually. They're all outstanding. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can I be on this side? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So I'm still kind of upset that Kendall ditched me at the Billboard red carpet event, but I don't want to bring it up here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You better Photoshop me if I'm next to these skinny bitches. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Beautiful. Kendall, great. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Did you get my color coordination e-mail? &gt;&gt; KENDALL:Yeah. We do that all the time. And we don't even try. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Did you have fun at Billboard? You didn't do any interviews, right? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. I was about to do an interview. And before the interview starts, I'm like, "Oh, no! Oh, no, I can't do it, I can't do it." And I just, like, walked off. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You didn't do it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Really? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-mm. I always see my older sisters sticking together and sticking up for each other, so I just wanted that with Kendall. I totally understand you had yourgoing on. I just felt like I really needed you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I totally understand you had yourgoing on. I just felt like I really needed you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I agree with you and I'm sorry. And I think that next time, we will communicate better. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: With everything that's happening with my dad, it's definitely gonna take a little bit of time for everyone to get used to everything. Hopefully, Kendall and I can just be there for each other when we're having a hard time. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I mean, I know you're, like, really independent, but I think I just have to remember that you're, like, my little sister and... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You have to take care of me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Got to protect you sometimes. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. You have a responsibility. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. Totally. Remember when you liked me and you would follow me around everywhere? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Good times. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You can come down, I'll show you this part of the house. What you said you liked was a lot of suits. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Bruce had some really good stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe I'll take something for my mom. What is something you, like, wore on a date with my mom? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Ooh. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Don't they both have that leather jacket? Or is it another one? &gt;&gt; KIM: This one? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Caitlyn might use that motorcycle jacket. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That would be really cute for Caitlyn, actually. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it would be. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am at Caitlyn's and I see that all of Bruce's clothes have been packed up. I know my mom has really been struggling and it's really been hard for her, so I think that giving her these clothes of Bruce's will bring some closure to her and maybe comfort her a little bit. This is a nice suit. Oh, this is my wedding suit! &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: That's... I was gonna say, that's your wedding suit. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm taking this. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I know you're taking it. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a fab memory from my wedding. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Sad? &gt;&gt; KIM: Fab. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Fab. I was like, "Sad?" I was going, wait a second, it wasn't sad. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is for me, Kendall, Kylie; I'm taking something for everyone. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Which one is, like, a classic Bruce? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Worn all the time? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Anything striped is classic Bruce. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: This one right here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. The girls said that one. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I think you literally wore this weekly. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: All the time, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, this one, I feel. And I'll keep these so where you can take them back at any time, if you would like. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: If I ever go back? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know that would be really important, probably to the girls and even my mom, to have some things that are just... have such history that it'll just be really special for them, and all these Bruce memories will come up in just a really positive way. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, that's all I need. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: That's what you need. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. I'll see you later. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Love you! &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you! I wanted to give you these things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, don't... hurt yourself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Caitlyn let me take this. This still has the tag on it, this Gucci jacket. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I bought him that. &gt;&gt; KIM: But these shorts, I felt like every vacation... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ah! &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew, ew, ew! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ah! &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't step on it, Mom. There's spiders in it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe this is an omen. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have all the other stuff, too. Did-did you not get it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm, yeah, but I haven't gotten... I didn't have the... nerve to open the bag. &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought this suit is, like, a... This is a David Rickey jacket that I know you guys got in Malibu. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. It makes me really sad. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can use the handkerchief to wipe your eyes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, that's okay. I think going through something like this is... difficult, because the whole thing is something I've never dealt with before. And I realize that I still have a long way to go before I can process all of this and understand it. And seeing these clothes and realizing that Bruce has thrown them out... makes it real. &gt;&gt; KIM: This, he wore on our Burberry Christmas card. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Long time ago. &gt;&gt; KIM: And this Prada suit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It smells like him. How did you remember all this stuff, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just anything that I thought would remind you of him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like this polo velvet, I felt like you would like. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought Kendall and Kylie and Khloe and all the kids could each take whatever polo shirt reminded us of him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. All right, I'll hang it all up and let the kids go through it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're welcome. Don't cry. Don't cry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just crazy that he's gone. &gt;&gt; KIM: But he's not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, he's not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's gone. &gt;&gt; KIM: On the next episode... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Caitlyn touched me today for the first time. I said, "I'm not supporting you. You don't support us." &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't want you to look bad, I don't want my mom to be hurt... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I think everybody is so oversensitive. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Lamar is in the hotel. If you are ready to go, then let's just go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I said to him, "Don't bring me into your article." I think this is just so shocking.
