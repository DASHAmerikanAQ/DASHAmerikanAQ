- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Previously on... I need Lamar's number. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why do you need Lamar's number? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I can check on him. Can't I do that? &gt;&gt; KIM: You just deserve so much better. Caitlyn let me take this. I know my mom has really been struggling, and it's really been hard for her, so I think that giving her these clothes of Bruce's will maybe comfort her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Makes me really sad. He's gone. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Hey, everybody. Welcome. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because I have no self-control, can we get two orders of the crispy Brussels? &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That sounds good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Look, I got lasered today. Aren't you proud of me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good girl. I need it on my vag so badly. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, God. Thanks for the info. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What did you do? I know you're like a hairy barracuda. I used to do laser so I had no hair. Now I've been taking these hair pills, and it made all my hair grow back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've done laser, and, yes, there's a little bit there, but, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but my bikini... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I also have taken hair pills. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She just got a Brazilian the other day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And had three kids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Brazilian what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wax. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. I was at your house, and you were saying you had to get it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I got a Brazilian hair treatment, not a Brazilian... You thought I'm getting a Brazilian bikini wax, and I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the hell's a Brazilian hair wax? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A Brazilian hair treatment is... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You kept saying it. I just kept saying, okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just thought that I was getting my vagina waxed, and I was talking about it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I thought you open about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I can't believe you thought I was talking about my vagina the whole time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wasn't offended. I just thought you were open about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm offended that you didn't say, "Khloe, why are you talking about yourso comfortably?" Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, shh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Made it. Long day today. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; MAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I still can't get over how freezing San Francisco is. So, I'm in San Francisco, and I'm going to be doing an interview about my game. The audience is mainly CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and it's a different audience for me, but I feel so honored to be here. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Stand by, here we go. &gt;&gt; CORY: I'm here with the co-collaborators of the mobile Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. This game's been a huge success. What, a little over $90 million? &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Yeah, $95 million in consumer revenues in the first nine months. &gt;&gt; CORY: Give me an example of something that during the development that you said, "Yeah, it's not quite right" or "Can't you make that better?" or...? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I changed the look of my character maybe a dozen times. I'll notice details on a shoe that aren't accurate. I want everything to look as lifelike as possible. I think just the whole experience of helping create the game has been so exciting for me. &gt;&gt; CORY: Really appreciate it. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, so nice to meet you. I really took the time to make the character look a certain way and the clothes and the wardrobe and hair and makeup. It's so satisfying because all of our hard work is really paying off. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Kimmie! Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Um, well, I'm getting ready to do a little shoot here in the house. &gt;&gt; KIM: Fun. Well, I am, um, in San Francisco, and I am gonna meet... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: For your book or what? &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, no. The video game. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, the video. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want a character in my game? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You know what? I'd be glad to... &gt;&gt; KIM: As the game goes on, I think it would be fun just to have the player be able to, like, meet my friends and my family members and have it really lifelike. So, think about it. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah, let me think about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll call you later. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: All right. Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: That would be great. That would be... &gt;&gt; KIM: Our first transgender character. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: That's a great storyline. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. Did you see the new black swans are so cute? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know that the strawberry Bio-Ks are not organic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but the other flavor tastes like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is just like a good-for-you thing. It's not really about the taste. Once... &gt;&gt; KRIS: How did you become this person? I raised you kind of on mac and cheese. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just good for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you feeling with everything? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kind of numb. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you even talked to Bruce? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, I did talk to Bruce. I got a call from him the other morning, and he said, "Do you have the gold medal?" And I said, "Yeah, I think so. It should be in the safe." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Didn't you guys, like, lose it at one point? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I couldn't find it once because he took it to something and misplaced it, so I called him and I said, "Yeah, it's right here. Come on over and get it. What do you need it for?" And he said, "Oh, I'm doing my Vanity Fair piece." And I said, "Oh." cover is coming out soon, and Bruce is going to reveal publicly Caitlyn for the first time. And I said, "That's amazing. What are you gonna say?" And he said, "Well, I will definitely set the record straight on this, and I know that didn't sound right, you know, on that Diane Sawyer interview, but I have got this." I was really blown away by some of the negative things that Bruce said during the Diane Sawyer interview. The whole thing made me feel really bad. Bruce knows that it's really important to us that we all support each other and are there for each other. So, we'll see. But anyway, I gave him the gold medal. I just wanted him to have it for his kids, sooner or later. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Kokes. I really need a snack. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Keeks. You look cute. : Oh. What happened there? &gt;&gt; KIM: I really need a hug. Just kidding. I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, you never hug me! Don't let go! Ooh. What happened? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, nothing. I went to Caitlyn's photo shoot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: She was pretty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, really pretty. I walked in. In the first shot, she was in this, like, Halston, like, goldish, like, gown. Vanity shoot. It was so good to just see how comfortable she is in her own skin. I'm so excited to see these pictures and to see the article and just for people to get to know Caitlyn. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, like, when you walked in, was he still shooting for the mag? &gt;&gt; KIM: Her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But, remember, we asked. &gt;&gt; KIM: I still... I asked a publicist, and I'm, like, "Do I call him 'him' or 'her' or whatever?" I'm just gonna say "her." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. I'm definitely having a harder time with the he-she pronouns. My remembrance of Bruce is a guy, so sometimes when I'm referring to "her," I say "him." I'm trying hard to be aware, but Caitlyn always says, "Don't overthink it, and call me whatever you want. I'm always gonna be Bruce, and I'm always gonna be Caitlyn." &gt;&gt; KIM: So, then I went into the closet, and she had to change. She was like, "You can stay in," and took off her top, and her boobs were, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kimberly! &gt;&gt; KIM: ...Kourtney's, like, when she first got hers done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, it made me want a boob job. Best boobs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, let's reverse. Let's reverse for one second. She has full implants? &gt;&gt; KIM: A full boob job. Like a "C." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Cool. She is just comfortable enough to take her top off in front of you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good for her. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then, she changed into a black skin-tight Herve dress. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Hello? Don't have service here. Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that Lamar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, if I could answer the phone. Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: You two are talking quite frequently. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. I'm with Kim. Can I call you back? Can you hear me? Kim, Lamar says, "Hi." &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Lamar! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She says, "Hi, Lamar!" So please tell Kanye and North he says "hi." &gt;&gt; KIM: I will. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Got it. What Barry White tone? I don't understand what that means. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know why Khloe and Lamar are talking, but he hurt her so badly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Kim is staring at me. I have to go. &gt;&gt; KIM: As a big sister, I'm just really protective, and for her just to be flirting with him on the phone makes me, like, sick to my stomach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, I just can't take it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What can't you take? &gt;&gt; KIM: The fact that when he decides to come around and be friendly, you're, like, flirting with him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm flirting with him how? By answering the phone and saying hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: You're just way more attentive. It was, like, French, you would be, like... And he's, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would French and Lamar even be in the same category? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just think, like, it's a dangerous slope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One I was married to, and one I... &gt;&gt; KIM: Who totally disappeared and completely broke your heart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love Lamar and care about him a lot. It makes me feel good to hear his voice and to know that he is doing okay. Kim's stance-- I know she means well, but I'm doing okay in my life. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just saying it's dangerous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. I'm not gonna not talk to Lamar because you disapprove. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just saying, do you really think that it's a smart decision? Like, I know you're a smart person. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For me to have a relationship with Lamar-- who cares? &gt;&gt; KIM: I read the article. article came out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not one nice word. It just sums up that I'm this piece ofperson. He can gohimself. I wish I never met this man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm on my way to Vegas. Lamar is in Vegas. &gt;&gt; DORIAN: Is he going to pop up in the club? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, but... &gt;&gt; DORIAN: Is he partying with us tonight? &gt;&gt; KIM: He is the cutest, you guys, let's not lie. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's ridiculous, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: He is the cutest kid. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's a supermodel. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I was at my Glu conference and Caitlyn called me and, um, I said does she want a character in my video game? Like, kind of just joking. And she's like, "Maybe." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What would even be bigger is if you got the Bruce character on now and the character transitions on the video game. Boom. That's a video game. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think you should be in the game, too. You know, you will come in and say, "Hey, do you want to hang out with Khloe and I?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sounds fun. I'll talk to him. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're adding in a bunch of different characters in the game. I think it would be fun for Scott's family, and I'd love to have him in the game. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, your zipper's open. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, it is. I thought you were saying a joke. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Flick of the wrist. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, did you know, when I was at Khloe's, Lamar called? And then he said something like, "Say hey, baby." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, that's some freaky &gt;&gt; KIM: I was like, "Seriously?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Call your ex and the two of you, "Talk dirty to me." "Hey, Barry." &gt;&gt; KIM: I was just like, "Seriously?" She would, like, got all shy and, like, ran outside and was talking private, and I was like, the fact that she's flirting with him-- she can't start this again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She always feels the same way, how she feels, like, did she end things too quickly. I said, "I don't know, Khloe, I don't know what else you could have done." &gt;&gt; KIM: I just-- I don't know, I think it's way too risky and way too... I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, obviously, but is that even what's happening? &gt;&gt; KIM: The fact that she was just flirting with him... Divorce is such a hard thing to get over, and I think that every time there's some kind of flirting, like, it just makes it so much more difficult. And I really think that Khloe can't move on with her life when she still has Lamar in the background. Luckily, I know this, that because they filed for separation and divorce, if she makes money, then it's her own, sole money, so at least that's good. Could you imagine if he didn't sign and she made all this money and then he took half? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Damn. Gonna leave with half. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; ATTENDANT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; ATTENDANT: Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good, thank you. I am on my way to Vegas. I have an appearance at 1 Oak. Hi! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hey. &gt;&gt; DORIAN: It's tight. Boo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Malika, Khadijah, Dorian and I always have such a good time together, so I'm excited for tonight. &gt;&gt; DORIAN: Oh, boo, this is so small. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You okay? It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Breathe, it's okay. Breathe. &gt;&gt; DORIAN: So sorry. No, I'm fine, no, I'm fine. Don't do that, don't do that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't do that. &gt;&gt; DORIAN: Aah! My God! Oh, my God. How light this is. Oh, Jesus, God. Like, if you look at, like, my feet are, like, creased over right now, I'm like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I forgot to tell you guys, um, Lamar is in Vegas. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: How do you know that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, I-I talked to Lamar, I know... I know he's, I know he's been in Vegas. &gt;&gt; DORIAN: Is he gonna pop up in the club? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, but... &gt;&gt; DORIAN: Is he partying with us tonight? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, but he is in Vegas. I have some anxiety about going to the club tonight, only because I know now Lamar lives in Vegas. And not that I wouldn't want to see him, but I definitely would not want to see him in a club atmosphere. &gt;&gt; DORIAN: Cheers to a great evening with great people. Elevate. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Thank you for another awesome trip to Vegas. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Hey, Nashville, can I introduce you to our new best friend? Here is Ms. Kim Kardashian, now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited to be here. I wish I was... I wish my voice was better, laryngitis was gone, but I'm so glad that I came to Nashville. I'm here in Nashville for an appearance. I am pregnant, I have laryngitis, but I never really cancel my commitments. I just don't think it's fair to the people that have put so much work into it. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: How are you feeling? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have laryngitis. So I'm a little under the weather. &gt;&gt; REPORTER 2: I just wrote a story where I dressed like you for the week. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh, that was you? Nice to meet you, I loved it. Vanity Fair magazine came out. How-how was her response to it? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to get into all those details, but... article came out. Everyone's, of course, asking questions. &gt;&gt; REPORTER 4: What does Kris think about all this happening? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not gonna go too deep into it. We have, in advance, asked everyone not to talk about that and just stick to the subject of why they're here. &gt;&gt; REPORTER 4: What will the, uh, the kids call Caitlyn? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, I don't know. We haven't thought about that yet. Caitlyn? I'm here to be a part of this event, and the last thing I want to do is, you know, derail from what I'm here to do. I just would rather not answer these types of questions. I just kind of want to get in and get out. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You should eat some blueberries. The headlines are, like, not nice right now. For Kris. &gt;&gt; KIM: I finally had a chance article, and all Caitlyn can talk about is that my mom mistreated her and was awful and just all these really weird things, when there's just no reason to bash my mom. I'm upset and hurt. I couldn't even imagine what my mom must be feeling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. I read the article. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce came over the day before he was gonna do that article. The next day he does this. I mean, we had this great life. We had a great marriage, we had two great kids, we had a lot of fun. We raised babies, we had birthday parties, we traveled. We went to amazing ski events. Not one nice word. It just sums up that I'm this piece ofperson who is mean. He can gohimself. I honestly wish I never met this man. I-I mean, justyou, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: So Lamar is in the hotel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My heart has just dropped to my stomach. Did you read it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What did it say? &gt;&gt; KIM: "I didn't really want to meet her 'cause she was just a Beverly Hills shopper." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The first thing you're gonna do is discredit your marriage of 25 years? I'm not gonna be fully supportive if she's not fully supportive of our mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He can go himself. I honestly wish I never met this man. I-I mean, justyou, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm annoyed for you, that you wasted... Not wasted, but spent... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wasted, yeah, well, it's... you're accurate. You're so acc... That's why I think this is just so shocking. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just crazy to me that Caitlyn would not discuss the years of really happy times. &gt;&gt; MAN: I declare that Bruce and Kris are now husband and wife. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Whoa, whoa, whoa! A romantic kiss for my beautiful, pregnant wife. Here comes our kids, they're so excited about the first day of school. Here's Kimberly-- yes, keep bopping around-- our teenager. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's my crazy husband. Honey, this is the only time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everything will by okay, I know it will. I, too... I'm very disappointed and I'm really upset with the way that Caitlyn said things about the family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then, you know, come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. All right, I got to rest my voice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sorry you're sick. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's all right. I'll be home tonight, go to the doctor in the morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, honey, get some rest, have some tea. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, love you. I will. Thank you. Love you. Bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; DORIAN: Those are good. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: If any of you get anything on my outfit before we walk out of this door, we are no longer friends. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: I don't have to be your friend-- I'm your sister. I could care less. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You ever been kicked in your face with a high heel? &gt;&gt; DORIAN: You look White House chic right now, and I'm all the way for it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; DEEJAY: Las Vegas, show some love for Khloe! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: So, security just came to me and said that Lamar is in the hotel and asked for a table. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My heart has just dropped to my stomach. Who told who this? &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: A security guard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, this is just not a place that I would want to see Lamar for the first time in years. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: If you are ready to go, then let's just go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just want to go back to my room and just have harmless, wild fun. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Want a piece of this?! &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; DORIAN: Khloe... Malika! Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: My ass is on fire. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want a pear? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I don't want a pear. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you think our grass is too green? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've asked people. Like, a helicopter was taking pics to do, like, a story about people who are watering their grass too much. We should find out what the rules are in a drought. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. I mean, I'm not an environmentalist. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, Kim went to San Fran. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, I would do the game under different circumstances, not the contract that they sent. I wouldn't want... a small up-front figure. I would just want a residual on people using my character. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim wants Scott to be a part of her video game, and, you know, it makes sense because we're all a part of it and Scott is obviously a part of Kim's life. I know how Scott is with negotiating business deals. I just don't want to get involved. I'll let him and Kim work it out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: To do a flat fee, why would I ever post anything about it or talk about it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So why did you tell me to do the deal for the flat fee? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's no way in hell I told you to. You straight trip, boo. Maybe your grass is too green. By the way, it looks like it's about to rain. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is raining. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The rain is here. I think we should go outside and do a rain dance. I mean... ♫ Let it rain, let it rain. ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, have you ever heard of this facial called Ultherapy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think you should do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, a tightening thing-- it hurts, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I can't do it while I'm breastfeeding. &gt;&gt; KIM: But when you're done, you should... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but I also... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you read it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I did read it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, what did it say? &gt;&gt; KIM: It starts off by saying, "I didn't really want to meet her, 'cause she was just a Beverly Hills shopper. And then when I found out she was flawed and had four kids, I was interested." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then what does she call Kendall and Kylie, a distraction? People dig themselves into their own holes. It's just I'm not gonna be fully supportive if she's not fully supportive of our mom. Like, you guys don't have to like each other. You guys could think your own opinions and feel the way you feel, but don't discredit the 25-plus years of marriage you guys had. Obviously you enjoyed some of it-- that's why you were there. And don't discredit all these children that you guys brought into this mix. This is your very first magazine article, and one of the first things you're gonna do is discredit my mom and your marriage of 25 years? We're just not a family who goes and bashes the other one publicly. If we have an issue with someone, we'll go and address it to their face. We're not gonna write about it Vanity Fair. Do as many articles as you want and do as many great things for the transgender community, but how does that... mean bashing my mom? I am all for Caitlyn screaming from the rooftops about her transition. I think it's beautiful, and I think Caitlyn should take pride in everything she's doing and the strength that it takes to do what she's doing on such a public platform. With that being said, Caitlyn does not need to tear anybody else down to build herself up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think she thinks she did anything wrong. I think she's obviously shut out all of the memories of Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you're allowed to bash my mom? That's not okay. We don't believe in bashing anybody. Like, we don't bash any parents. I expect her to do the same. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am definitely gonna go talk to Caitlyn, just to, like, let her know that it's not appropriate, the things that she's been saying, and she just needs to leave Mom out of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agree. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause it's just like enough is enough. Some woman from the ESPYS texts me once a day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So are you going? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not rewarding bad behavior and how she disrespects Mom. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: You should answer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. I'm so, so sorry. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, this is cute. Or no? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ruffles and stripes? What? Kourtney, are you okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not joking. Caitlyn has that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce texted me today. &gt;&gt; KIM: Or Caitlyn. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's a... told me to call him Bruce, which I have in writing. came out, I said, "What do you want me to call you?" He said, "Whatever you're comfortable with, I want you to call me that." I said, "I don't want to be disrespectful, and I want to honor what you want." He goes, "No." That's weird. Why would you want me to call you Bruce if your name is Caitlyn? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Some woman from the ESPYS texts me once a day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So are you going? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I think we have to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, what-what's happening? I'm not going. I'm not rewarding bad behavior and how she disrespects Mom. Caitlyn has been awarded the Arthur Ashe for Courage Award at the ESPYS this year. Of course, she wants all of her kids to be by her side while she's accepting the award. I'm not supporting you. You don't support us. I typically would be there, front and center, but I think Caitlyn needs to take a little Vanity article and how she's hurting other people right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'd like this if it was solid. Or is the sleeve too crazy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just think the sleeve is weird. Hi, pooch. Hi, sista. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want to say hi to KoKo? Nope. These things come in other colors, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do they come in other styles? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that paparazzi? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Just a couple. ♫ ♫ Hi. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so thirsty I'm gonna die. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, let me tell you. So, we're at the upfronts, and all of a sudden I go to the restroom with Mom. She goes, "I don't have the time to put down one of those seat protectors. I was always squatting, and it's like a Slip 'N Slide." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, you put it down, it never stays there. You sit down, it's over here, it's over there. It's just, like, whatever. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you talked to Lamar lately? You're not answering? You plead the fifth? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would I answer your questions after the last time you saw, when I spoke to Lamar, your reaction? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I spoke to Lamar. I didn't actually speak to him, but I texted him. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't understand it. Like, what good could come out of it? There's been such a loss of trust for over two years that will take a lifetime to repair. So what's the point in involving the whole family again? I mean, why my mom's even putting her energy into it. It's just weird. I'm not gonna lie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is it weird? I've just always been very supportive. &gt;&gt; KIM: So you're just, like, promoting it like it's totally normal and fine? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not promoting it! I'm not promoting it! But I feel her heart. I know everything... &gt;&gt; KIM: But don't you want to protect her heart for later? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have. Yes, I do. I don't think it's for us to judge her heart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But have you asked how I feel? Never once have you asked how I feel. I married him really thinking, for the rest of my life I would love to be married to him, and I will always love him. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Do you like my shoes? Me and Kourt did that. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: They're cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was thinking I want to rent, like, a big yacht and, like, go somewhere and... &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Go where? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just like you cruise on a boat, like Beyoncé and Jay Z style. You know, like, Beyonc... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I know, but pretend like you kind of... you don't have, like, a destination of just where you want to go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. St. Barts. I don't know. I just got the number to a yacht company. Ugh! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Did you? Oh, so, you're really trying to do this? You should answer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Hey. I'm so, so sorry. Lamar's best friend since he's been, like, 12, Jamie, just passed away unexpectedly. This is all just really upsetting. He's distraught and devastated. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I missed you, son. &gt;&gt; JAMIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar has suffered so much loss in his life. I'm always gonna be there for Lamar, especially when something as tragic as this happens. Okay. Bye. Onedeath after another. I can't handle it. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Is he okay? As good as can be expected type of thing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm really on high alert for Lamar because, I mean, anything, I think, will set him to spiral, and that's kind of the last thing I want for him. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: That guy can't get a break. It sucks. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We all know Kim is the star, but Kourtney and Khloe... And Kim's getting everything, and we're kind of left in the backseat. &gt;&gt; KIM: She really loved you and cherished your 25 years together as a family. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: And I... and I loved her, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: It sounded like she beat theout of you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Take it easy. Don't go there. &gt;&gt; KIM: You've got to see my house, just being under construction. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then I just got an e-mail saying, "Hey, they're using hazardous materials." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. How are you doing, and how is everything after... I mean, Jamie died? It's so insane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so sad how he died. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's weird... &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...that, you know, the best man in our wedding is now dead. I care about Lamar, so I want the best for him. I was just there for him as a friend or whatever, and... that's all I can do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. And that's all you can do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I know I've been a little bit tough on Khloe as far as her divorce with Lamar, but, you know, I think that I'm gonna just put all my feelings aside and, you know, just really be there for her and be a sister for her and not really waste my opinion. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you not wearing a bra? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I am. It just looks like it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your boobs are, like, massive. And they're gonna get bigger, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm, like, ten times this size. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! I'm gonna make your boobs a Twitter account. The left one will talk to the right one. &gt;&gt; KIM: One's better than the other. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Which one's better? &gt;&gt; KIM: The left one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have some big-ass boobs. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've not eaten all day, and I'm in one of those moods where if I don't eat, like, now... I'll murder someone. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Where you'll be less and less accommodating of, uh... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: ...Scott's demands as a... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, exactly. You know, I had reservations on setting up this meeting with Scott and Niccolo, 'cause Scott always wants to do a side deal or wants to, you know, just start wheeling and dealing about some other things, but I'd love to have him in the game. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Great to meet you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you copying me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? Huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're wearing the same outfit. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. I thought I was underdressed. Now I don't feel so bad. I thought we saw each other at the Christmas party at the... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: We did. Yeah, we did. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If the whole game's premise is, trying to work your way from the normal working class to stardom, I don't mind being a helping hand in that process, because Kim is widely known for having amazing cars and style. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I would love to be, like, "All right, guys, today I'm gonna take you for a ride in my new car to show you exactly what it's like to go here or there." But, like, they actually get into a car that looks like hers. Listen, we all know Kim is the star, but Kourtney and Khloe and whoever else feel a drop... not disrespected so much, but they feel like they were left out in a sense. Because, you know, they... They'll notice that a Kardashian Kollection logo on a jean pocket in the game. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And in life, they're partners on that. They think, Kim's getting everything, and we're kind of left in the backseat. &gt;&gt; KIM: Working with family definitely has its pros and its cons, and I know how to work with my sisters really well. I'm not too sure I'm comfortable with the way that Scott's positioning himself in this game. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's give a little equity out... &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...and look at what happens. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And for me processing and pushing this, I will obviously be taking a finder's fee, and I'll be taking my equity, and I would like to also be a shareholder in all other games that you will ever come with... &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: For the rest of my life, this company, beyond. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. Sky's the limit. San Tropez, here I come. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, hey, hey! &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh! It's trouble in town. How you doing? I can get you a water. Would you like a water, or...? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, no. I brought one. Thank you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You sure? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: So... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I'm just... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Am I in trouble? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you...? Oh, yes, you're in trouble. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I'm in trouble? How could I be in trouble? Sweet, adorable little thing like me? &gt;&gt; KIM: You still have a lot of Bruce in you. I thought Caitlyn would be a little kinder. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah, kinder, sweeter, gentler. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where do you want to go? Sit here? I think Caitlyn has no idea that she said some things that were hurtful, so I came to her house in Malibu to really sit down with her and explain, we are just really upset. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Where do we start? &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, Khloe. Let's start with Khloe. I know that she's really harsh when she communicates with you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Wow. You want to read her text? &gt;&gt; KIM: She sent them to me. Um... and that's how Khloe talks to all of us. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: So it's not just you. Khloe sees my mom upset, and so she gets defensive. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Doesn't... and doesn't know anything about my side of the story. &gt;&gt; KIM: But that's what kids do. They don't know the full side. I understand that Bruce was so angry and confused when he was having his gender issues, but now that Caitlyn is really happy and accepted and loving her life, there's no need for her to be pulling anyone else down, or bashing us along with her journey. Vanity as well, and I think that there's some things that you said that you might not realize are hurtful. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Go. &gt;&gt; KIM: You said Kendall and Kylie were distractions. And so, when they read that, they're gonna think... I don't know if they'll quite understand that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You know how the print word is, yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Then it said, "Had Kris been accepting to who I am, we still would be together." And that's the most unfair thing in the world to say. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I don't... See, I don't look at it that way. &gt;&gt; KIM: I went to... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I don't look at it that way. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't look at it that way, but my mom does. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Okay. She was... &gt;&gt; KIM: And if you are a woman now, she is not a lesbian. She does not want to be with a woman. That's not fair to ask. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I'm not saying I would have gone this... I'm not saying I would have gone this route, but as time went on, our relationship changed drastically. In-in my eyes, it's like, "I don't, I don't need him anymore," you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think it was that. I think, honestly, and-and... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: And I felt it in the way she treated me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: She wanted me out of the house. She was like, "You're out of here." &gt;&gt; KIM: Because it wasn't meant to be, and that... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: "You're out of here." &gt;&gt; KIM: ...you should say, "Thank you, good riddance, 'cause now I am who I am and I'm happy." You know? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Then don't react and be so, you know, emotional over the breakup. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you can't fault her. That obviously means she really loved you and cherished your 25 years together as a family. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: And I loved her, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Towards the end, it never would've worked, and that's fine, and she's okay with that. You both agree that the end was bad. You guys were in a bad place, but if I was with someone for 25 years, I would try to look for the positive things and just end it on a good note. I'm just asking you to go back in your memory and remember all the good times that you had, 'cause you had at least 15 years. You said, "Oh, Kris mistreated me." It sounded like she beat the out of you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Take it easy. Don't go... &gt;&gt; KIM: You could've had a little bit more respect, but... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Don't-don't go... I can see where you're trying to go here. Don't go there. &gt;&gt; KIM: You've got the fame, but you're losing your family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just so disappointed. I think I just need to get away from the negative energy. I don't think I realized how deeply the <i>Vanity Fair</i> article would affect me. It's just too much. &gt;&gt; KIM: You could have had a little bit more respect, but... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Don't-don't go... I can't see where you're trying to go here. Don't go there. &gt;&gt; KIM: You've got the fame, but you're losing your family. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I want nothing but good to come out of this. I want nothing but good to come out of my relationship with all my kids. &gt;&gt; KIM: You look amazing. It's your time, but you don't have to bash us on your way up. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I tried to be as honest as I could in how I felt. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I never once ever tried to do anything that would hurt her. I'm so upset that everybody kind of is taking things the wrong way. Everybody's on edge. She's feeling bad. I feel bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: No matter what, we're a family, and even though you and my mom aren't together anymore, and there's this full separation, we still need to have a united front and understand each other. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I get that. &gt;&gt; KIM: So just mend it. So we can all... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Move on. But I can't apologize. I can't apologize unless they come out here. Nobody's come out. Kourtney hasn't made a move at all. Obviously Khloe hasn't come close. You know, I feel so isolated out here. Uh, you know, it's like all of a sudden, there's this wall. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that you just have to get the family unity going again. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I just want everybody to be happy. I love, love, love all my kids. I wish you guys were here every damn day. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, pretty girl. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? What kind of water contraption is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's my diffuser thing. I have lemon and oranges in it now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Cool. I'll take one of those. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I could make more. &gt;&gt; KIM: You'd share?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I share with you all the time. You like your water? &gt;&gt; KIM: Tastes like a tropical vacation. So guess what. I went over and I talked to Vanity Fair article. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How did she receive the information you gave her? &gt;&gt; KIM: She doesn't know how to listen that well. She acts like she's listening, but she's always kind of thinking and, like, waiting... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause everything she says is very calculated and... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...thought through, instead of just having a normal, casual conversation. I can't go there, 'cause him and I are feuding. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What, you're still feuding? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We've got a new feud going on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's the new feud? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She wouldn't apologize to my mom. I'm still really disappointed in Caitlyn, because her words in were so negative, and I definitely don't feel like Caitlyn is putting in an effort to apologize to my mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: The problem is she doesn't think that there was something wrong. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The only thing, the only thing she cared about was that her Twitter followers went up more in one day than Obama's did. &gt;&gt; KIM: And do you want to know why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll tell you why! &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 'Cause the greatest athlete of all time turned into awoman. Who-who cares, though, like at the end of the day? Like, that's what's important? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know what's happening. I don't know. I think that Caitlyn should have a personal apology to my mother. You would think, when you're married to someone for 20-plus years, you could call them and have, like, a genuine, sincere apology. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: There you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just looking at these photos from Kendall's birthday party. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. How cool. Your boobs are enormous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are huge. I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When your boobs catch up with your butt, you know you're in trouble. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thanks. Thanks for making me feel so good about myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I just wanted to talk to you about, um, a couple things and I didn't want you to worry, but I think I'm gonna, um... leave town. For a little bit. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause I'm just having a really tough time. And just... I think, after article, I was... I'm just so disappointed. I think I just need to... kind of get away from the negative energy. I don't think that I realized Vanity Fair article coming out would affect me. It's just too much. I just think it'd be really healthy for me to just go... : ...clear my head. Just... I just need to. I just need to. &gt;&gt; KIM: You need to just go relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that's, like, the best thing that you can do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is just to get away and, like, focus on how you feel and just really, like, live in that moment. I'm so happy that my mom's going out of town and just finally doing something for herself. Being so far away will just start the healing process for her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When you have gone through everything we've all gone through for the last couple of months... I just didn't see it coming. So I think I just need to go... rest my head and my heart. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. On the next episode... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We don't care if you want to transition. We want to support you and be there for you. And I think you would come from a place of more compassion. Then you try to tell me that I don't know what I'm talking about, because I... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Because you don't know. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to be mad, but then I also worry about Scott's safety. He definitely has a problem. : I've worked so hard to, like, keep this family together. It just makes me sad for the kids.
