- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... I think you should be in the game, too. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sounds fun. I'll talk to him. I'll obviously be taking a finder's fee, and I'll be taking my equity. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not too sure I'm comfortable with the way that Scott's positioning himself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kim's getting everything, and we're kind of left in the backseat. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: The headlines are, like, not nice right now. I'm reading the <i>Vanity Fair</i> article. There's just no reason to bash my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wish I never met this man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't go there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What, you're still feuding? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We got a new feud going on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's the new feud? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She wouldn't apologize to my mom. This is so cute. Oh, my God, you look so cute. That's what you do in fittings? Our fittings are so different. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: This is cute with the hat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Got to feed my model sister. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Don't feed the model. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get to feed my model sister. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Models can't eat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She eats. She eats, like, burgers and &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are these pants? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, baby. I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you, too. It looks so pretty and nice. You're definitely living the good life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. Can you see this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. It's called a camera phone. I can see it. Yes, girl! You get your martini on! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just trying to relax and get my head together. I don't know if you can hear or see what's going on at the moment... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, again, it's a camera phone. I can see and hear everything perfectly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, I'm at Kendall's house, and I'm watching her do a fitting, and I see her cute little butt cheeks hanging out of these cute little leather shorts, and I'm very envious. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tell Kendall I love her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She can hear you. &gt;&gt; COREY: Khlo, I love you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. I didn't know you were there. I was wondering where the hell you've been. &gt;&gt; COREY: Khloe, you're really the S-H--T double hockey sticks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm the MVP. This has been real. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you, too. Cheers! Have fun! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, Kenny. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mwah! Got to go! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. I didn't know Corey's there. When did he get there? Thank God I didn't say anything crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: These are so pretty. This fabric is divine! Oh, my God, I went to this facialist yesterday. You're gonna die. It's these pulses that exercise your whole face so it tightens your whole neck, and then your whole face. If you put a pulse here, literally my shoulder went... Yeah, it was like... Then you do it here. My mouth literally was Kourtney's mouth, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why does it do that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, you can't control your face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you do that? &gt;&gt; KIM: My whole mouth was literally to here. It was Kourtney's face times ten. Like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got to do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, so did you see...? I got to pull this up. Did you see Bruce's tweet that he did, talking about Mom? Caitlyn! Caitlyn's tweet. Sorry. Hold on. Let me... search. Okay, so this is what she said. article reminded me of the love and good times Kris and I shared for so many years. I wouldn't trade that time for anything!" Exclamation mark. the article made her... reminded her of that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I told him just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Or is that the part that she left out? &gt;&gt; KIM: That was the part. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So why didn't she say that? Why wouldn't she call Mom and say she's sorry herself? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. That... you can really talk to Caitlyn about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't really care to. I think that Caitlyn should have a personal apology to my mother. My mom isn't gonna read the tweet. I just don't think that's a very sincere way to apologize to somebody. I just don't want to be in, like, a negative environment all the time. I don't want to, like, always be fighting with her. No one else cares to, like, argue with her, so why do I? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know this person anymore. Bruce is gone, and I don't know Caitlyn. Simple as that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, they definitely have way different personalities. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They are... just polar opposites. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Genuinely, they're two totally different people. And as they should be. tell us before he transitioned, "I'm the same. I'm this, I'm that, I'll nev..." Like, "Bruce is always gonna be here." Can I see Bruce for a second? 'Cause I don't know who this person is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but, you know, wants to live her life, and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, and she can, but she doesn't have to live her life... &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, it sucks, but you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...at the expense of bashing other people. &gt;&gt; KIM: 100%, and that's why... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So live your life, and do you, honey, but if you want us all to support you, don't bash the people we love when you hurt a lot of other people. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe has really known Bruce her entire life. He's always been a father figure to her, and it's really hard on her. I feel sad for Khloe. A lot has changed, and you can't deny that. I just think that you and Caitlyn need to just, like, talk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: About? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just, like, to express how you feel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't mind talking to her, but, like, it's not a real relationship anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. Can you darken this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't like when you darken it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my... I'll do it my... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, you look so much prettier like this. 10,000 times prettier... &gt;&gt; KHLOE AND SCOTT: Than what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...than when you darken it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What does she darken? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone, get off my &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What does she darken? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This little mole on her face right here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, and it makes guacamole? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, and I'm like, "Why?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She likes to accentuate. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, on Sunday, when I was calling Mom to FaceTime her, she was, like, wild, having the best time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All of a sudden, she, like, turns the phone, and Corey is with her. She flew Corey out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They were sitting outside, pooling it up, like, looking all... She had a martini with three olives, and turns the phone, and he was like, "I love you." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's pretty nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He is... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He is the nicest. He couldn't be nicer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He is so nice. He doesn't do anything. Corey is my mom's friend... I guess. Who are you smirking at? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just this guy I met in Spain. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom was just in a 20-plus-year marriage, and I feel like I just want her to just think wisely about what she's doing before she gets hurt. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, he treats your mom pretty good. Like, he talks a... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does he? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, he, like, talks about her like that's his baby girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She says... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's a baby girl? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY AND SCOTT: Yes! a baby girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, he said, "How did this little girl push this little girl out of her, and six of them?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I kind of like him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like him, too. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think there's a really good chance he's not gonna turn into a woman, either. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott has a nightclub appearance in Vegas, and I don't always come with him, but he wanted me to come, and so I decided to invite a bunch of friends so we can make it a fun night out for us. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Where do we want to get lunch at? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We could go to the pool party. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Is this the naked pool? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it's no pressure. Whatever you guys want to do. Whatever is... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Are they completely naked? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I think you can just go topless. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Good thing I brought my pasties. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I brought the pasties for my little sausage. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There was a girl last time whose whole vagina was literally out. She would, like, grind down, like, on a pole, like down to the floor, and, like, her whole crotch would come out. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: Her dress, like, went up over her hips. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And Scott went on the mic and was like, "See this girl over here with her vagina out!" She never realized that Scott was talking about her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've been to this place before, guys. Court, I pumped in here, remember? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pump! Pump it up! How long is it gonna take you bitches to get ready? 'Cause I got to start my time commitment. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Five minutes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Five minutes? Starting now! Man, are we ever gonna get the up out of here? So, let me get one of those cigarettes. Is that the last one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are we going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Damn, look. I feel like a promoter tonight with all these bitches. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A promoter? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, like I'm bringing all the girls to the club. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, I guess I am the promoter in some ways. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that a real cigarette? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, this is the new fake kind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where do we want to sit? ♫ ♫ I think I'm gonna have some tea. I need some caffeine, guys, just to, like... pump up the jam. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: These are the sickest wings ever. They just pull off. I'm obsessed with these things. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: No, you literally need to have, like, a commercial. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, did you, um, ever text Kim about the video game? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I told her. I'm not just gonna say yes to the-the standard terms. It just doesn't make sense. I told her I got to negotiate with the people. I'm not just gonna say yes to the terms that you guys did. I mean, it's not worth it or the money. You probably deserved a trillion times more. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim mentioned to me that she wants Scott to be a part of her video game. I really don't ever like to get involved with Scott's business deals, and, you know, this whole issue with Kim and Scott, I just... I don't want to get wrapped up in it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to discuss it. I'm not just gonna say yes to it. I got to at least try to counter. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I don't even know what the game really is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are we ready? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, we got to go. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; DEEJAY: Make some noise for Scott Disick right now! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, that's so cool. Is this real fur? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I might rent an apartment in Beverly Hills, a one-bedroom just for glam purposes. Like, I go to Gunnar's, come all the way back here, go all the way back downtown-- 'cause Kendall and I are going to a basketball game. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're really getting back into the swing of things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been going to basketball games all this year. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like basketball. We're going... Kendall wants to go. L... You know, like, there's nothing calculated. People go to basketball games. Not you, not your type of person. You go to photo shoots in the Met Ball. Like, I'm a different person. &gt;&gt; KIM: Basketball games are fun. They've got good candy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I can't eat that. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Scott just got back to me, and he wants more money than you. And I was like, "Oh, come on, Scott." I invited Scott to be in my video game app. I wanted him in the game. He's the father of Kourtney's kids-- he's family. But he's demanding more money than Kourtney got and just... he has all these crazy demands. I was like, "Scott, not a chance." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so different, but on my 1 OAK deal, he was in... he was missing in Aspen, and he claims he did my 1 OAK deal and he didn't. And Scott still invoiced. I said no. This is what he... Like... No, and I had to give him the commission. And, like, he was in Aspen. &gt;&gt; KIM: A part of me just feels like I need to cut Scott out of the game right now, just because it's becoming too dramatic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm... It pisses me off. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, he's insane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How was your trip? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was so good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You ended up going with your boyfriend? The fact that you're not correcting me that he isn't your boyfriend... Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's in France. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When's he come home? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No clue. Scott has gone on a crazy bender. He called Megan and asked her to get him a plane to Anguilla. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not your problem. Not yourproblem. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you! &gt;&gt; MAN: Right here, ma'am. Right here, right here. There you go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Welcome back, Corey! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited to see what's going on. I'm really excited to be home. I get to see my kids. So I'm going over to Kylie's and help her move into her new house. I feel like it's Christmas, and it's not even my house. &gt;&gt; COREY: I'm excited for Kylie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; COREY: Her house is gonna be really dope, and it's so good that she's right by her big sisters. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Corey is such a great guy, and the kids really like him a lot. But I'm a little nervous to see their reaction when they see Corey's with me. Everyone can yell at me at the same time and we'll just get it over with in one fell swoop. Then I can go home and have a vodka. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JEFF: That looks great there. You like? Lower? We could even put a table back there, like, a skinny table, so you can have candles and stuff. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Skinny table. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Today is such a big day. I'm moving in. The house isn't quite ready, but it's a huge step and we're moving in a lot of stuff. I know that I have to wait till I'm 18 before I can officially move in, but seeing all this furniture come in is really getting me excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She takes everything of mine. These are my knobs from my glam room. The exact knobs. These are the knobs from my closet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. This does not look like a house ready to move into, Kyles. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I mean, we're working on it. I don't know if I like the brown. I feel like it might be too manly or something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You just need to, like, wait a sec. Let it breathe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Move your eyes. Blink. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. What's all this about? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Going in the guesthouse. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My Mason! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are back? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I missed you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First my mom doesn't tell any of us that Corey is meeting her on her vacation. And now, on Kylie's move-in day, Corey is with my mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey. Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you so excited? &gt;&gt; COREY: I'm going to take off. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, date whoever you want to date, but I find it interesting that you downplay your relationship. How was your trip? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was so good. It feels like, literally, forever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then you ended up going with your boyfriend? First of all, the fact that you're not correcting me that he isn't your boyfriend is you're finally admitting you have a boyfriend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not going to admit anything. I am not on trial here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not saying you don't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's so great. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, boys! &gt;&gt; BENNY: What up, guy? Got some ice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Call your father. Tell him you're not gonna be home for supper. We'll go down for dinner in, like, ten minutes. We'll eat and then we'll go to the club. I'm back to Vegas, doing an appearance at 1 OAK, and I'm bringing all my guy friends. And, of course, Kourtney's not thrilled, but she never is. You know, it's the story of my life. You know, she doesn't really like some of my occupations. It's never easy, but Daddy's got to bring home the bacon. All right, guys, let's do it. &gt;&gt; BENNY: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, let's go. &gt;&gt; MAN: You got to explain these things, man. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on. Let's go, let's go! All right, to the club! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; DEEJAY: Ladies, the Lord is in the building. Make some noise! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What up, Las Vegas? What's going on? Las Vegas, let's buy some drinks! Let'sgo! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, I'm not in it. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, wait, it needs to be a square. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think any of those were good. Hi. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that one okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's the only decent one of all of us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. What did he say? Sorry. Khloe was talking too loud. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was talking too loud. So what's our meeting about today? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just listen, and let me tell you if it's good or not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, what's going on, Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... not much, player. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, what's going on over there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Chris was just saying that, um, Scott kept calling him, but he wasn't answering. I don't know. Scott has gone out of town for an appearance and has gone on a crazy... bender, and so, at this point, all of his friends are just kind of keeping me in the loop. Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He said to me... He said, he called Megan, and he asked her to get him a plane to Anguilla, and then he wanted to fly from Anguilla to his 1 OAK appearance on Friday. And Megan said, "I actually can't do anything for you. I'm so sorry." 'Cause I told her... she cannot. Um, how would he lose his wallet? &gt;&gt; KIM: Not your problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not your problem. Every time you're gonna pick up the phone, he lost his wallet... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...he needs an airplane, he needs... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm not dealing with it, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know what's going on with Scott. I mean, he lost his wallet, he needs a plane. If I were to take a guess, it's just Scott, like, partying and being an idiot, and Kourtney is just cleaning up after his mess again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys ready to go? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When I wake up, I feel sick. That's how I feel pretty much every day. Scott-- he'll go out of town and then go off the deep end, and I just don't know if it's a pattern that I can continue with. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: We really haven't had a chance to sit down and talk after you sent me those really tough texts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We don't care if you want to transition, but we don't think... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...that that entails you speaking negatively about my mom. And then when you try to tell me that I don't know what I'm talking about because I... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Because you don't know. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mommy! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you gonna sleep on the couch, Mase? &gt;&gt; MASON: Oh, yes. I'm gonna get some funky funky. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're gonna get funky on the couch? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah, and jump on it. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, in regards to my video game... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Was the guy making it happen, or what? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um... For you guys, if you want it, but... I mean, I just feel like... I'm not really, like, proud of, like, Scott's actions lately, and I feel like... I don't want him to be in my video game. I just don't feel like I want that energy in the game. Like, what is he gonna do? Go and, like, around and party and club with everyone? You know what I mean? I'd rather just, like, take a step back for a second, at least for now. I don't know. I'm just not feeling it right now. And that's okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Hi, babe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I'm wonderful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me see your purse. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, don't get jealous. Donatella Ver... Versace sent it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Gorgeous. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: It's a, uh, not on the market yet, but, so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not on the market? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Neither are the glasses. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't say "the market." &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Okay, not, not... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, not in stores yet. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: It's not in stores yet, neither are the... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you don't say, "on the market." It's not... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: She also sent the... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Those are cool. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm an aviator girl, but these are very... You, I could see MJ wearing these. Like, they're very, like, chic, like Jackie O. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah, exactly. But, um, enough of that. We really haven't had a chance to sit down and talk after you sent me those really kind of... tough texts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Caitlyn and I have been texting, and we both agreed that we should have a face-to-face and just have a conversation as to everything that's been happening lately. Kim said that you said they were tough, and Kim read all of them. And then she was like, "These really weren't that tough." I just said, like, we don't care what you're doing, like, meaning, like, we don't care if you want to transition. We want to support you and be there for you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But we don't think... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...that that entails you speaking negatively about my mom. In our opinion... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...you don't need to even mention our mom. Let's focus on the actual cause here, and let's not drag my mom through the mud. I would think you would come from a place of more compassion, especially when you have two young daughters who are greatly affected by it. And that was really my premise for the text messages. And then, when you tried to tell me that I don't know what I'm talking about, because I... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Because you don't know. You don't know. I'll be very honest with you. If she would have been okay with me... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay with you transitioning and still being married to her? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Not so much even transitioning. Just living with it. She would just have to be okay. Instead, I constantly had to hide myself. I wasn't able to talk about it. Then once I got out to Malibu and we went our separate directions, I said, "Here I am at my age, and I got the same problems I had when I was ten years old." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: "What the hell am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna continue to hide?" I'm sick of that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've realized that I want two or three days to myself, and then I miss Corey and I want to be with Corey. I don't want to get married. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if Corey said, "It's either marry me, or we have to break up?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Scott Disick gets very hands-on with brunette stylist while Kourtney Kardashian looks after the kids in L.A." &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just embarrassing. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Once I got out to Malibu and we went our separate directions, I said, "Here I am at my age, and I got the same problems I had when I was ten years old." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: "What the hell am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna continue to hide?" I'm sick of that. I didn't think it was like a hatchet job on your mother. I have no... no issues with her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You know, we took our break, and... she was happier, I think, and I was happier. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I think you guys are both way happier. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is what should have happened. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Honestly, I wish she would call, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, tell her that, 'cause I think you guys... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I have no problem. I'd have her out to the house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it's very weird... I could not imagine having a child with someone and not having some sort of relationship with them. I really appreciate Caitlyn for saying she is sorry for how the article came off and that was never her intention. And that's a huge step in the right direction. And I'm not gonna fight over the same thing over and over and over again. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I don't have any issues with her. I had 23 great years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, good. Bruce and I have always had an awesome relationship, and I really want my relationship with Caitlyn to be great, as well. And that's gonna take some time, and there's gonna be, you know, energy that needs to be put into that. There's a lot of miscommunication, I think, 'cause our channels of communication have dwindled a lot. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: So many people in this family... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but you could do... Have you ever done group texting? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, God. Group texting-- you think that's the way to go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, if you have an important dinner, and you... could just send a text one time, and you say, "Hey, dinner." &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: How do I... how do I do that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me show you. So, messages-- that little box right there... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Okay, hold on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's where you text. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Let me get my little... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your phone's right here. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: In my, uh, Donatella Versace... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You go to that button. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Okay, button. Oh, wait a second-- now what, who did...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have group texts going on all the time. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah, I know. All right, I love you. I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What made you fly Corey out to your trip? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I missed him. So he came out for the last week. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we really had a good time. Yeah, it was fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's in France. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's he doing there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He just went with Shaul on their boat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. When's he come home? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No clue. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okeydokey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, he'll be amazing for, like, three months and then he'll go out of town and then just go off the deep end and I don't really hear from him. And I just don't know if it's a pattern that I can continue with. I just focus on myself these days. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And my children. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, that's... a positive attitude, I guess. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The only thing that's been hard is that I feel like when I wake up I feel sick. That's how... I feel pretty much every day. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. What shoes are those? &gt;&gt; KRIS: These are Céline. I got 'em in Paris. This is my Dalai Lama look. 'Cause I'm going to see the Dalai Lama on Sunday. What are you eating? &gt;&gt; KIM: A chicken enchilada. Do you want one? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Chog. Can I call you right back? &gt;&gt; CICI: No, no, no... &gt;&gt; KIM: What? Wait, hold on. I'm putting you on speaker. My mom's here. &gt;&gt; CICI: Scott, front and arms around a girl, laying down together, with their arms around each other. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! &gt;&gt; CICI: Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That piece of &gt;&gt; CICI: Laying down! Laying down! They're laying down together! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hold on. Here it is. "Exclusive: Scott Disick gets very hands-on with brunette stylist while Kourtney Kardashian looks after the kids in L.A." &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at this one. These pictures of Scott with some girl, feeding each other food, it's disrespectful. I think I've often made excuses for Scott, and it's just getting tougher and tougher. &gt;&gt; CICI: We've all stuck up for him one too many days too long. It's over. He took the yacht and the jet and the women and Saint-Tropez over Kourtney and the three kids. He just showed his worth. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel bad for Kourtney. It's got to be really hard. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but maybe, you know, it's time. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Have you always been attracted to older women? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Answer the question. &gt;&gt; COREY: I just want to bring her genuine happiness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim has heard you guys have sex before. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, when's the last time you talked to him? As time goes on, Scott seems to just get worse. That was Chris. He just said that he's hysterically crying and being suicidal. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. Nice dress. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, that's Kim's after-baby dress. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it's my everyday dress. Thanks for the hand-me-down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Joyce and Larry Crane's anniversary. 12:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m." Fancy. "Girl night with Sheila. 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m." You only allotted three hours for girls' night with Sheila? How do you not know you want to get crazy and spend more time with her? The and then I go to bed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then you say you got to go 'cause it's 7:59? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are a friend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't realize how much I loved to be by myself. I've realized that I really crave it sometimes, where I want two or three days to myself, and then I miss Corey and I want to be with Corey. I've realized I don't want to get married, but I really have a lot of fun with Corey and I love being with him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if Corey said, "I want to get married, and it's either marry me or we have to break up." &gt;&gt; KRIS: He said, "I don't want kids. I love you, and I feel that way about you." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom's been downplaying her relationship with Corey for so long that I'm now realizing her and Corey have a way deeper relationship than my mom wants to admit to. And, you know, she needs to speak up and say, "You know, I like this guy. This is my man." So let all of us embrace that. But when you're downplaying it, it's hard for us to be on the same page as you. Do you guys say you love each other? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're such a little cutie-- you should have someone that loves you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I literally probably have too much sex. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I never asked you how much sex you have. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm exhausted. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. That's... that's just too much. Seriously? Like... Ugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna eat my lunch in here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my little... ooh, my little cutie. Mom told me she's had more sex now with Corey than she ever has had. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good for her. What are you looking at, how wide this shirt makes me look? I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I wasn't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, whoa, complex. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But if you say so. Ugh, my phone doesn't really work in here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a good ringtone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. Well, when's the last time you talked to him? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm trying to, like, eavesdrop on her conversation a little bit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason sent him a text at, like, 9:00 at night. And then today he wrote me at 1:30 and said, "I wanted to tell you to tell the kids I love them, and anything that ever comes up bad about me wasn't their fault." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think she knows where he is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I talked to my therapist this morning, and she said to see if the rehab place, like, has an interventionist. The interventionists are usually like bounty hunters. Like, they're usually really good at getting people to go. Okay, bye. That was Chris. He just said that he's, like, hysterically crying and saying, like, "I love you. I don't..." Just, like, being, like, suicidal talk. And he's like, "I've never heard him do that ever. Like, cry." The guy from the rehab said, "Just call 911 if you think something, you know? You don't want to be sorry and have not called 911." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: As time goes on, Scott seems to just get worse. And, you know, I want to be mad, but then I also worry about just Scott's safety. And, you know, he definitely has a problem that he has to deal with. And so it's hard. I feel like my emotions get, like, all over the place. Chris was like, "If they go in, do they arrest him and take him to jail? Or do they, like, take him to the rehab?" Like, he just doesn't want to get him put in jail. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But that could be the best thing for him. That's the biggest wakeup call of all, to be thrown in jail with no alcohol, no nothing, no pillow. &gt;&gt; KIM: No one to bail him out. You know? Kourtney sees a lot of things that she wasn't... aware of before. And I think she's done everything she can to help Scott, and that's just what's really heartbreaking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A lot of people, they see this behavior and they're thinking, "Ugh, I just don't want to ever be in this situation." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's always the same. I could never depend on him for one single thing. I've worked so hard to, like, keep this family together, but I'm just literally on the verge of, like, a mental breakdown. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi, Keekles. Mwah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me see. Oh, my goodness. So gorgeous. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I feel like we should go somewhere. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Doesn't this make me look bigger? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No. The way you're sitting, you do look like you have massive hips, but it doesn't look like that when you stand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you haven't seen me standing. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I did. I FaceTimed you earlier. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cheers to 20 Questions. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: To 20 Questions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I invited Corey to dinner tonight, and I invited Malika. Malika is great at asking questions. She asks, like, from a way where someone doesn't feel attacked. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yo, it's not my fault that I'm tardy to the party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know nothing about Corey. So now that I see my mom taking him on vacations and hanging out with him more, I want to get to know Corey. &gt;&gt; COREY: Thanks for inviting me to dinner. I'm excited to be with my-my... the coolest crew. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; COREY: Don't jump down on me too hard. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You know, we wouldn't be good daughters if we didn't, you know, just sit you down and see where your head is. &gt;&gt; COREY: Whenever. I'm-I'm ready anytime y'all ready. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you ever been to jail? &gt;&gt; COREY: No. I ain't Mr. Perfect. None of that type of stuff but no trouble that's a disrespect or a threat to another human. But don'twith me. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You and I are basically the same age. Have you always been attracted to older women? &gt;&gt; COREY: Since I used to hit on my second grade teacher. But there's not even a age factor, just a connection. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to get married? &gt;&gt; COREY: I don't think love is measured by that piece of paper, because I know people that are not married that are strong as hell. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you don't want kids? &gt;&gt; COREY: It really does not matter, because... Listen, I've raised some kids in my time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who have you raised? &gt;&gt; COREY: My nieces and nephews. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; COREY: So if I don't have kids and the love is still strong and we got the friendship, like the current situation I'm in, then I'm cool with that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah, actually, her shop is closed. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So I'm not gonna miss out... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think he knows that. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When you met my mom at that party, like, what made you want to go up to her? &gt;&gt; COREY: She had on this nice-ass dress and she was looking good. I waited till she, you know, was kind of off on her own. I came up and started talking. We started talking. Then I asked her to come up onto the stage and dance. So we started dancing. But then other people... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, so that was the move, "Do you want to dance?" &gt;&gt; COREY: We was talking... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I like that she danced. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: She loves to dance. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like that she danced. &gt;&gt; COREY: We liked the song. Then I just tried. I said, "You're beautiful. I would love to get to know you." And it went from there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I like to see the way you light up when you talk about her, though-- that's cute. That's a pretty big smile. Aw. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want whatever makes my mom happy, and if Corey makes my mom happy, then that's what I want for her. &gt;&gt; COREY: I love that woman. She's gone through a lot of stuff. My thing with her is I just want to bring her genuine happiness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim has heard you guys have sex before. Did you know that? Oh, my God, she was so scared. &gt;&gt; COREY: That could've been the washer and dryer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it was upstairs. She heard it. &gt;&gt; COREY: But you know she had that new washer and dryer put... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Stop. Just-just let it go. We-we know what's up. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MASON: One, two, three, four. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: One, two. &gt;&gt; MASON: One, two. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: One. Uh, yeah. Three, four. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are we going to the ESPYS? &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like we should. But not walk the red carpet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's not even doing the carpet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, I know this sounds crazy-- I don't know-- I just feel like we need new male energy. I just feel everyone has to just realize what's not good for them and move in the right direction of... just having a positive life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just literally on the verge of, like, a mental breakdown. &gt;&gt; KIM: My heart breaks for Kourtney, but it's time that Kourtney doesn't have that toxic part of their relationship in her life. It's not a healthy way to live, and it's not the life that Kourtney should be living. I think you have to just really try to move on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just literally on the verge of, like, a mental breakdown. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think you have to just try to move on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just, like... I can't believe that this is what's... what my life is at right now, you know? I've worked so hard to, like, keep this family together. It just makes me sad for the kids, but... it's, like... it's better off. He's not... being a good partner to me. I could never rely on him, depend on him for one single thing, and I don't want to, like, show my kids that that's okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mase. &gt;&gt; MASON: I have piano right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: You do? Oh, my God, can you show me? Come here. Let me see your piano. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All I care about is you being happy. I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What made you stay in bed all night? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I missed you. I'm too lonely by myself. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God! My water broke. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's get this baby on the road! I'm gonna be a father. And we've got a girl. &gt;&gt; MASON: Daddy! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doin'? &gt;&gt; MASON: I missed you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Another one. Another one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love Scott, but I've been dealing with this for so long. This is definitely not good for me. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Aah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to face the facts. If you want to die, then you can continue to act this way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nothing I can say to you. I'll be out of here. It's just stressful, like, how much we've fought, like, over all these years. Are we gonna spend the rest of our life doing this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: At this point, I'm really just trying to focus on me and the kids and make them the priority. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sorry, I didn't want him to see you crying. : Um... I mean, I just think you have been going through this for years. Obviously, you'll always care about Scott. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And he'll always be my family. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can't live the same life that you've been living. It's been, like, eight years. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I can't do it anymore. Like, my mind is completely made up. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I know that, like, him just staying here, nothing would change. &gt;&gt; KIM: But are you guys gonna, like, fully break up or is... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. No, I mean, I told him that. God just, like, opened my eyes and was like, "You need to move on." &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I really think you're doing the right thing. Like, I truly, in my heart of hearts, think you're doing the right thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need it... to be done. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll have wine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt is lettin' loose. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's coming back, everybody! &gt;&gt; KIM: This is the best shape you've ever been in. They want you to do the cover of Complex. &gt;&gt; MAN: So hot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you wet the nipples? All over. She's arrived. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I'm back! &gt;&gt; KIM: Chin up a little bit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't copy every pose I'm doing-- stick with the one pose I gave you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I don't know what I would do without you guys. Thank you for being so understanding. Should we hold hands? Come on, we can shake up the paparazzis if we leave together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you. I really do. &gt;&gt; KENDALL:Girls family vacay! &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie invited Tyga. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, I get it. I would rather be with a man, too. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that Kylie's name? &gt;&gt; TYGA: What, here? Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I was really looking forward to this trip to hang out with you. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Once you have preeclampsia, you are at risk for having it again. &gt;&gt; KIM: They saw more fluid than normal in my placenta, which could mean I have diabetes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: James and Lamar, they ran into each other in Vegas yesterday. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you sign the divorce papers? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In the next few days, it'll be done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It breaks my heart to see her in pain. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's been a really hard time, going from, like, having all of you guys to having nobody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You forget what happened when you're on a binge. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Iup. I made the worst decision I could have ever made in my life.
