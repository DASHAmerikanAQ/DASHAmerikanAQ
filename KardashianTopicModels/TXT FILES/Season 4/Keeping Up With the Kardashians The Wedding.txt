- &gt;&gt; KIM: My family and I have been through a lot these last couple of years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's a spider on you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm feeling really dirty tonight. &gt;&gt; KIM: We've had our highs and lows. Guess what's come back to haunt us? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dad would never let any of this happen. I just want you guys to be proud of me; I really do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just don't think that's appropriate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't want him to get upset one more time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why do you guys lie to me like this all the time? &gt;&gt; KIM: Relationships have come and gone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't had a boyfriend in so long. And it's like I don't trust anybody. I'm so confused on why we're even together. Kourtney and Scott, stop making out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello? Kourtney, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: This is my first time I've been in love. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I love you. Aw, I can't even take you right now. Maybe I'll just go back to New York. &gt;&gt; KIM: But through it all, we always stand by each other. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The new you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, the new me. &gt;&gt; KIM: And now... my older sister's pregnant and she's living with her boyfriend Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's our baby? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie and I have decided to spend some time apart. I hate being single! And my mom and Bruce have moved into an amazing house with my brother Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It might not even fit, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's got to fit. &gt;&gt; KIM: But everything is about to get a whole lot crazier. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I'm getting married. &gt;&gt; KIM: What?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In nine days. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tonight on <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>with the Kardashians:</i> "The Wedding." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Would you marry me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: You're getting married! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, what does he do? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: He plays for the Lakers. &gt;&gt; VERA WANG: Wow, it's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I met Lamar, and we're getting married a month later. &gt;&gt; VERA: Seriously? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got to listen to the news to find out that you're engaged? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is really mean. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't know when you're wrong. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scream about it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not wrong! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Screw you, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You won't be walking anybody down theaisle. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: I, Khloe take you, Lamar... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I, Khloe take you, Lamar... &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: ...to be my husband. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo, I'm a cheerleader, yeah. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah? Why don't you come try to take it from me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar's my boyfriend. I met him when I was hosting a party. This isn't fair. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You got to try hard. It's like when you're trying to make out with me... how you really try hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He plays for the Lakers. Finally, someone that I can date that lives in L.A. Good job, Khloe. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I love the way you run, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I run like a loser. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No. I love the way you run. Really flick your wrist like we're hanging out. You want to shoot it like, "Hey, doll." You want to honey the basketball. Even say it to yourself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honey. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Honey... there you go, you said it and it went in. See that? There you go. Look who's learning how to play basketball. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've never had someone tell me so many times a day how pretty I am, and talk to me like that and just make me feel like I am everything that he says I am. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Do you know why I love this game so much, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: When my mother passed away... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I just went to the park and I just played and played and played. No joke, I didn't go in the house. I stayed outside for two days. And when things really get messed up, if I play basketball, I can just forget about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar's mom passed away when he was 12 of cancer. And my father passed away when I was 19 of cancer. And that's something we have in common. I've never had someone be so honest with me about their life and about their past. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Where do you see yourself, ten, 15, 20 years from now, besides, one day you being my wife. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you know I'm going to be your wife one day? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Ah, that's easy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You can tell. When you know, you know. &gt;&gt; Three cheers to sake? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Three cheers to us, not the sake. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm here like trying to keep it real with you. Like, I'm letting my swag down a little bit. It's hard for me to do. I'm like being, um, sentimental. I think I found a woman that I'm compatible with. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So what does this mean? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That I want to hang out forever. I want to get married right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You mean marry me? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I would do it right now. We meet on the 27th. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Your birthday's on the 27th. So we should get married on the 27th. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to get married on my birthday? September 27? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: September 27. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just cannot see the rest of my life without Lamar. The 27th is perfect. Our wedding has to be on the 27th. Your favorite number is seven? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then there's two of us. So it's two-seven. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: There's two of us. And do you remember the last flight that I took from New York? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Was United Flight 27. Now we can go with these signs. We can just say, "Oh, what a coincidence" and like wait two, three, four, five more years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why do we have to wait? I don't want to wait. Honestly, I have never felt this way. I am head over heels in love. And Lamar's head over heels in love with me. I just know it's right. Until death do us part. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I promise you, I'll never leave you, no matter what. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No matter what. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo, Khlo? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe's not here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where is she? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: She knew you guys were coming? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. We've been calling her. Since my parents moved out, Khloe has moved into their old house temporarily. She normally answers my BBMs, like, the second I write her. And I feel like I never see her anymore, since we don't live together. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I feel bad that you guys came over and she's not here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And we thought we would come by because we were going to lunch. We wanted her to come with us. &gt;&gt; KIM: We haven't talked to her in forever. I don't even know what's going on. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: She's in love, you guys. That's what happens. &gt;&gt; KIM: She just met this guy. Khloe just met Lamar, and, like, we've only met him once. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's up with them? Is that where she is now? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah, that's where she is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where? He lives here? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yes, but they've been staying at the SLS Hotel. Honey, they've got this new life going on together. I don't know what they're doing. They're shacked up in the dungeon at the SLS, and that's where they stay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe doesn't tell me anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: She hasn't told us anything. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Maybe she's just not ready to tell you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If she's in love and she's happy, like, wouldn't you want to share that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, she has not mentioned this at all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys, are you going to come up for air? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Never. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just saying. Okay. I've never seen Khloe have this much PDA in front of me in my life. She barely introduces me to a boyfriend. Maybe she's finally found the right guy. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: There's a reason why we wanted to have dinner tonight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: We want to be a family. I want to marry your daughter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We want to get married. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Whoo! This one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kitchen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Preggos! Oh, hello! Telling my mom about the engagement was seriously the hardest part. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, you guys, come on, grow up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Telling my sisters-- this part's going to be so fun. I can't wait to see my sisters' faces when I tell them. You guys, I have something to say. I'm getting married. &gt;&gt; KIM: What?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In nine days. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, but... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm being serious. I'm engaged. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: To Lamar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who else would I be engaged to? &gt;&gt; KIM: At first we think she's joking. Where's your ring? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have to go pick it out. We haven't picked it out yet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you're not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom went to dinner with him, and he asked Mom for my hand in marriage. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why didn't you tell us? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I-I... it was... it was a minute ago. I mean, come on, nine days? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, nine days. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just found out that Lamar wanted to propose to Khloe. And now she's telling me that she wants a wedding in nine days? I don't even know how to wrap my head around this. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's the rush? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why nine days? People usually get engaged for like a year. I know Khloe has only known Lamar for two and a half weeks, but I really haven't talked to her much since then. So to hear that she's getting married is just crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am a thousand percent head over heels in love with someone. And I can't help how I feel. I can't help that I know with every being in my body, this is the person I want to be with for the rest of my life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So when are you going to tell Bruce? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to tell Bruce when I have my ring. So I'd rather no one really speak on it right now. Bruce has never really been a fan of any of the men that I've dated, and I know he won't take any of this whole wedding stuff seriously unless Lamar proves himself. So I'm not going to tell him anything until I have a ring. Our father figure who's going to be so judgmental anyway. You guys are like, "This is BS." &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're not saying this is BS. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think it's BS, I just don't... &gt;&gt; KIM: We just think it's a little fast. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just thinking of what has to be done in, like, nine, ten days. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know it's fast... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have invitations... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just wish I knew the guy. Like, I don't know Lamar. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've met him once. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've met him once. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've met him one time. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, we don't know him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, you guys... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're talking invitations and flowers and cake... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, you guys are not being supportive. Whenever you and Reggie go through something, I'm there for you. I don't ask you questions. You-- I'm there, holding you, helping you throw up, cleaning yourface. Be there. My mom and my sisters are just so negative about this whole thing. It's just really hurting my feelings and ruining my excitement about my engagement. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just a little bit shocking when you come in and say you're getting married in nine days. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, you're making this not fun anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, we're excited for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It just is hurtful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nine days to complete the impossible. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a little bit shocking. &gt;&gt; KRIS:do you have to be so mean? &gt;&gt; ROB: What have I done? I haven't said besides... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Actually, you did. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're being rude. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, scream about it. Scream about it. Scream about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're so immature and you don't know when to apologize. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Would you marry me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Get that. Get into the house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're wasting your time. Start working out. I want to see some sweat if you're going to be doing this. Can you believe it? Kris bought a new house? We have a lot of room, but I find out with the extra floor space, Rob moves back in. &gt;&gt; ROB: And I'm trying to get into shape. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Trying to thin out the skin? Cut up a little bit? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm trying to be like Lamar. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, well, speaking of Lamar, what do you think of him? I don't even know the guy. &gt;&gt; ROB: He's honestly, he's an amazing guy. I'm sure you'd think, you know, basketball player... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They don't have a good track record. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean athletes, whatever, but he's got his own clothing line. Minus the fact that he just won the championship. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who cares? That's the least I care about. I care about one thing: how he's going to treat Khloe. That's all. Khloe and I have always had a very close relationship. We've really been together since she was like five years old. As she's grown up, I just have always questioned her judgment when it comes to men. Now Lamar, very questionable. He's got to kind of prove himself to me. I mean, look at all these girls. I mean, how many losers have they been with? Khloe-- before this-- <i>losers.</i> &gt;&gt; ROB: Losers. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, I don't have a lot of confidence in their choice in men. &gt;&gt; ROB: I completely agree with you, but this guy's different. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're just not saying this because you want Laker tickets? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and I talked this morning, and I'm, like, "Okay, I didn't even know this was going on." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This just makes me not even want to involve anyone in it, though. I was expecting from my sisters more of a positive reaction when I'm telling them I'm gonna get married. Honestly, I could go to a courthouse and sign papers and be done. I don't need a wedding. Like, it's almost like it's so stressful, it's like, this... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's not, though. Don't look at it that way. It's not. She wants to make it a priority to be in your life and be there for you if this is a decision that you're making. No one's trying to change that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How old are his kids? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 11 and eight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely want to be supportive of Khloe, but it is my obligation as Khloe's sister to be the voice of reason because it is something serious. Is there a need to be a rush? I'm just, like, I just want to know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, he starts his games, and then we won't be able to do it until next summer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe getting married definitely makes me think about my future with Scott and marriage, and we are holding off until I have this baby and we see what our relationship evolves to and how we feel at the time. So you don't want a year to plan? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I don't need a year to plan. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have to be a pregnant bridesmaid? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You'll be gorgeous. We'll put extra material in the front. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: As long as I've known Khloe and her history with men, if she's telling me that she's a hundred percent positive this is what she wants to do, then I'm gonna support her. And of course it means I get to give Khloe a crazy bachelorette party. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe, are you gonna keep your sister informed of what's going on with you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I already said I would. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want you to say it 12 times now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: These are the times that I wish I could just pick you up and throw you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Where's Khloe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She didn't tell you she was gonna go with the wedding...? &gt;&gt; ROB: Lamar said November. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, they're getting married in September. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: September 27th. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For real. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think it's beautiful for Khloe and Lamar. And if they're both happy and both in love, then I would do the same thing. But Bruce will definitely be very, very angry. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this a joke? It's, like, they haven't had a chance to have their first argument, they haven't had a chance to like... &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, don't be a hater. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're not being haters. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're being realistic, I get it. &gt;&gt; KIM: She didn't tell us anything about this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think she's in a panic mode. They're trying to get a lot done in a really short amount of time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, why are they trying to get married so soon? &gt;&gt; ROB: 'Cause of, probably... &gt;&gt; ROB AND KRIS: ...NBA season. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Reggie and I were together for years. And you know, we were on the fast track to get married. Khloe's only met Lamar, known him for two weeks. I just really think I'm gonna need a Xanax during the wedding. &gt;&gt; ALLISON: I think it'll be fun. I'll be there to hold you up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I'm gonna be sitting there crying like a zombie. Like, "This was supposed to be me. This was supposed to be me!" Like, I think, you know, like, what if I have a nervous breakdown when they're like, "Does anyone object?" What if I'm, like, "This was supposed to be me!" Like in a dream. Well, since I already planned my wedding and I know what I want my cake to look like and I know what I want my flowers to look like and I have it all planned out and cut out, I can give it to Khloe. Maybe it'll be useful for someone. I just, like, don't know, like, three weeks after meeting someone, I really don't know if this is such a good idea. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, Kim, we get it. That's how you feel, but it's gonna happen next week, and that's it. And it has nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I don't want it to be, like, the whole time, like, "Kim's jealous of the wedding," 'cause I'm really not. He's so tall, I can't even... &gt;&gt; ROB: What does he have to do with anything? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not jealous. &gt;&gt; ROB: I understand that Kim and Reggie broke up, and you know, I am dealing with my situation with my ex-girlfriend Adrienne. You don't see me bashing on Khloe and Lamar's wedding at all. That's really rude to say that about Khloe. She's marrying this guy... &gt;&gt; KIM: I said he's tall? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, you said you wouldn't want to be married to that guy anyway 'cause he's tall. Who gives a? Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: You're an &gt;&gt; KRIS: You take things too far, this is what I'm... &gt;&gt; ROB: It's the truth. It's reality! Deal with it! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why do you have to be so mean?! &gt;&gt; ROB: What have I done?! I haven't said! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, actually, you did! &gt;&gt; KIM: You're being rude! &gt;&gt; ROB: Scream about it. Scream about it. Scream about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're so immature that you don't even know when you're wrong! You don't know when you're wrong, and that's probably why you and Adrienne have a big problem 'cause you don't know when you're wrong and you don't know when to apologize! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm on my way to go try on dresses at Vera Wang. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you think this means at a bachelorette party? &gt;&gt; ROB: Scream about it. Scream about it! &gt;&gt; KIM: You're being rude! &gt;&gt; ROB: Scream about it! &gt;&gt; KIM: You're dumb! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, I don't know where all this anger is coming from... &gt;&gt; ROB: It's this psycho bitch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, she's not a psycho bitch. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, he was rude to me! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is rude. &gt;&gt; ROB: And you were rude to Khloe's future husband. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Listen, everybody's got to get a grip. This is mean-spirited stuff that we can't get into. Let me just point out that I think that a year ago you thought things for you were gonna go a lot differently and you would be in a different place today, and that didn't work out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Six months ago, my ex-girlfriend Adrienne moved back east to New York, and I just truly miss her and regret everything that I did to hurt her, and I just, I really want her back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I think Kim, there's a side of Kim that felt... feels the same way. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to know. I don't like my life being, like, "What's going on? Are we together? Aren't we together?" You know? Khloe getting married has really made me think about my own love life, and you know, I'm still sad, but I don't really, it's not really my personality to get really mad and yell, and I just don't want to fight with my brother Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And suddenly you find yourselves single and confused a little bit, you know? And you guys have to come to grips with what's going on, and be really living the moment of Kourtney and her baby, and Khloe and her marriage. &gt;&gt; ROB: I agree, and I apologize for yelling at you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, guys! Hey, Rob! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're just having a little fabulous family chitty-chat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Fabu. What's the topic of discussion? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, Khloe's getting married. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: To who? &gt;&gt; KRIS: To Lamar. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, who would have thought Khloe would have been the first one to get married? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're in love. They're on the fast track. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm in love. I'm not getting married after two weeks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you, God! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are we really gonna be able to pull this wedding off? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is my thing. Give me a chance. I've waited my whole life to give a wedding. At first, I was petrified at the thought of throwing a wedding in nine days, but I've waited 25 years to throw this wedding, and I'm gonna make sure it's perfect. I just want to know who's gonna walk you down the aisle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, like Rob-- he's a Kardashian, he's my brother, he looks like my dad. Like, he's just, like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, it would kill Bruce if he didn't walk you down the aisle. We're planning a wedding, and he doesn't even know about it. I mean, that's nuts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, guess what. As soon as I get my ring, I will tell Bruce. So in the meantime, keep your mouth shut and don't tell him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe keeps telling me that she wants to wait till she gets the ring to tell Bruce that she's gonna get married, but we all know that Khloe is scared to death to tell Bruce because any father would have a problem with their daughter getting married in nine days, but she's gotta tell him. Khloe, I'm gonna do the best I can to keep my mouth shut, but I promise you that if Bruce finds out, this is gonna blow up in our face. And I just, I don't want him to feel left out. That wouldn't be nice either. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I don't want him to either. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, it would really hurt his feelings. And I think, he just... like, one guy can only take so much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob is my blood, and Rob, when I look at him, he reminds me of my dad, and is my brother, and I want Rob to be a part of my wedding as well. And so, you know, I would love if Rob would walk me down the aisle. Rob?! &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you?! &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm in my room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I found you. You were hiding from me. &gt;&gt; ROB: <i>Hola.</i> What's up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why does your room smell like this? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's incense that your homeboy Lamar got me, buddy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Homeboy. &gt;&gt; ROB: Homie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Speaking of Lamar... &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I wanted to know, um, if you would want to walk me down the aisle. &gt;&gt; ROB: I would love to do that for you, especially if that's what you want, but I do think that, you know, first of all, you should tell Bruce what's going on, and I think that, you know, he should be the one. He's been in your life since you were five, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm definitely gonna tell him about our engagement and our wedding, just not right now. I want to wait till I have my ring and all that to tell him, but... &gt;&gt; ROB: No, honestly, though, like, out of respect, you know, you really should have Bruce walk you down the aisle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you getting distracted when I do that? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I don't know why you keep touching your boobs. And you have a bruise on your boob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's a bite mark. Rob... &gt;&gt; ROB: Aye! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are walking me me down... &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yeah, baby! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...the aisle, okay? No if, ands or buts, baby! Today I'm so excited 'cause I'm in New York City with Malika, and I'm on my way to go try on dresses at Vera Wang's. I'm so thrilled. So we're gonna go to Vera's. Vera Wang has been a friend of the family's for years. By the grace of Vera's heart, she agreed to design my dress, basically. Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! Can you ask Vera if she can do dresses for me and your sisters? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I just need to get colors. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are your colors? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, my dress is white, and my favorite color's purple, so purple will be incorporated-- I just don't know what shade yet. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Lavenderish. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, lavenderish or like... Oh, my God, that beautiful color of a hydrangea; kind of purply. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, that's a little bright. I mean, I'm... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This isn't about you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, but can you just get me a purple dress, rather than a lavender dress? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the problem with Kris: you give her an inch, she takes a mile. This is my wedding, so it's gonna be done my way. I have to go. I'm here. I have to go. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; VERA: Hey, baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; VERA: You're looking hot. You look great. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi. &gt;&gt; VERA: Hi. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm Malika. &gt;&gt; VERA: Malika, how are you? Nice to meet you. Your mom... your mom sent kisses to me this morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. We are... &gt;&gt; VERA: Anyway... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Vera Wang has set aside this dress just for me. She thought it would be perfect for my wedding day. &gt;&gt; MAN: I would take the jewel off and put some draping here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; MAN: And change the sash to be... You know, if you want to do more of a purple... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, she's crying. &gt;&gt; VERA: No, you're not crying. Dude, you never cry. You guys, this is going to be the big cryfest. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, don't cry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the moment of truth. I have never looked for wedding dresses before, so I cannot wait to see what it looks like on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sneaking around, planning my daughter's wedding. I hate lying to Bruce. Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you think this means at a bachelorette party? &gt;&gt; VERA: It's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love how it fits, too. &gt;&gt; VERA: Yes, and you know what I love? And you have the height. Kind of like fabu just like that, man. It's kind of scary. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe, are we dying for this one? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I love it. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: She has a dress! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This whole thing is like a dream come true. I never really thought I was the marrying type, and so I never really knew the significance of what a wedding dress means, but finally having one on, I feel like this is amazing. This is what a wedding's about. You have to find the perfect dress, and I really feel like I found that. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, and I love it. I love it. &gt;&gt; VERA: I love it. How long have you known each other? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're going to think it's crazy. I met him, and we're getting married a month later. &gt;&gt; VERA: Seriously? Get me a helmet and a seatbelt. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi, Kenny! Hi, Bruce! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're having a meeting. I go over to my mom's house to meet with Malika about planning the bachelorette party, and it's so awkward because Bruce still doesn't know what's going on. Okay, well, you want to sit in this meeting, you just need to be quiet. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And peaceful. We definitely don't want to go to a club. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, what's this company that can do, like everything for us? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Pleasure Chest. Okay, let's call. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Have you ever been there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I haven't. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Thank you for calling Pleasure Chest. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Um, we are trying to plan a bachelorette/wedding shower. I just wanted to see, like, what you had in mind for, like, a bachelorette party. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It varies. There's so many different things. We have sex toy demos. We can do party games. Um, we can do fellatio workshops with bananas and cucumbers. We do like little gift bags that have lotions and toys in them. We even offer, um... I guess, stripping classes where we have strippers go and bring their own poles. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, I feel like we should do all of it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. We'll see you in, then. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, thank you. Bye. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: All right. Thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, right? Hi, doll. Sharon is the ultimate wedding planner, and I am going to make sure that my daughter has the most beautiful, glamorous, delicious wedding in the whole entire world. &gt;&gt; SHARON: We'll start working on budgets. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; SHARON: We'll get a caterer. The florist's ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; SHARON: And then we'll plan on when we need to do the rehearsal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, we don't know about food. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Do you want steak? Do you want fish? Do you want chicken? I mean, do you want lobster? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob! &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come here, quick. Okay, give me an answer. Beef or fish? &gt;&gt; ROB: Beef or fish? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just tell me. Beef or fish? Pick one. &gt;&gt; ROB: Beef. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's have steak. It's a sign. &gt;&gt; SHARON: There you go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so do steak... &gt;&gt; ROB: But Khloe doesn't eat steak. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I do. Okay? &gt;&gt; SHARON: Yeah, we'll have that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's do that, let's... &gt;&gt; SHARON: No problem. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then as far as champagne, I like Cristal, so maybe we should have Cristal. 'Cause I like Cristal. Yeah, it's Cristal. &gt;&gt; ROB: My mom is being extremely selfish. She says she's planning "Khloe's wedding," but, you know, she's obviously planning her dream wedding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, here comes Bruce. He doesn't know what's going on. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. This is Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Meet Sharon. Sharon and Robin. Sharon's a friend of mine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're having a little meeting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello, Robin. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is now a nightmare. I want to honor Khloe's wishes. I want to keep this a secret from Bruce until she tells him. I hate lying to Bruce. It's just not right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, I just flew my helicopter and now I'm going to go hit some golf balls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. You're going to go get dressed? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a tough day. &gt;&gt; SHARON: It's a tough one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a tough life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sneaking around, planning my daughter's wedding. It's every mom's dream having a wedding for one of my daughters. My vision for the perfect wedding is flowers by Mark's Garden. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Flowers galore. &gt;&gt; FLORIST: All of these roses here are yours. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All of those? &gt;&gt; FLORIST: 5,000 roses. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; FLORIST: For your ceremony. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have thought about this my entire life. So I choose Gearys for Khloe to go register for her wedding gifts. Just like my dream come true. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's fine. I don't even have to be here. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Honey, you're going to pick what you want. Just come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm trying to be really patient with my mom, but I'm here for a reason. Shouldn't I have a say in something? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If something catches your eye... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just say it now, or do we have to get, like, that scanning gun? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, this is not Target, honey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, sorry. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, this silver-plate, we're getting for everyday. Now we're on it. Oh this is Christofle. Oh, my. She wants to do the red Hermes. Okay, great. So, we'll keep looking. Khloe, come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, I can't believe this. This is supposed to be <i>my</i> wedding registry and she's picking out things that she did with my dad. Hello? This is, like, 40 years later. This is my house, my wedding registry. Let me pick something. &gt;&gt; SALESWOMAN: Let's see. This one will be $750 a place setting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For one place setting, it's... &gt;&gt; SALESWOMAN: For one place setting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not buying it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: None of my friends could afford anything in this store. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. This is $750 for one knife, one spoon, one spoon, one fork and one fork? Is that correct? &gt;&gt; KRIS: But the other set... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm just... I'm asking. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, for the set. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, that just is, like, retarded to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What you guys think about these? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: They're beautiful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In the Baccarat? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know what's happening.. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you like the Baccarat? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's crazy. Seriously, I think my mother is now possessed. She is turning into Satan slowly but surely. I mean, she is ruining this for me. Like, this is her wedding all of a sudden. It's not mine. I am so ready to call this entire wedding off. I just want to go to Vegas and elope. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, I think you're almost done with your dishes and your glasses and your silver. That was easy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You picked it all. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got to listen to the news to find out that you're engaged? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then I'm done with the conversation. You are wrong! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not wrong! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When it is true love, you just know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so exhausted. Shopping with my mom is so tiring, but being with Lamar is making me realize why I love doing all this and why I want to be married. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hmm? I love you. No. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I love you more. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: More than candy? Of course. Are you ready to be with one woman for the rest of your life? All finished. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I feel better now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's why I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You sure? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need to talk to you about Adrienne. I have to tell Rob that I ended up inviting his ex-girlfriend Adrienne to the wedding. I mean, she's one of my really good friends, but I'm still not sure how he's going to react. It wasn't the cleanest breakup. I invited her to the wedding and I just... I don't want you to be mad, but she's one of my best friends. And I'm only telling you so you don't feel, like sideswiped and taken off guard then. But, I mean... If you pull me in, I swear to God, I'll beat theout of you. You have noidea. Do you understand? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay? &gt;&gt; ROB: Honestly, I would love to... you know, love to see Adrienne. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, you're not mad? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. Now that I, like, realized I want to be back with her, I would love to see her. I'm so happy that Adrienne is coming to the wedding and you know, I haven't really had a chance to speak with her since our breakup, but this could, you know, be my opportunity of getting that second chance. Should I ask her to come with me to the wedding or, like, what do I... as a date, or...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a little overboard. You guys weren't on the best talking terms the last time, so... &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, then I think it's a great start, to, like you know... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agree. So, we're cool? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, yeah. I'm happy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're happy? Good. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm happy Adrienne's coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. I'm happy you're happy. I'm happy it's my wedding! High five. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you guys have a, um, bachelorette section? &gt;&gt; CLERK: We do. Uh, it's straight down this aisle on the left. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Got it. Kim and I are throwing Khloe her bachelorette/wedding shower, and we go to The Pleasure Chest, which is a famous sex store in L.A. Ooh, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can we play "spin the bottle"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Penis bouquet. &gt;&gt; KIM: A penis piñata. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We should get that. &gt;&gt; KIM: We just have to get it. Should we get, like, two? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause we're decorating the room first. &gt;&gt; KIM: Should we have a ring toss? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. Whose butt would we stick that on? Mom's. We could all throw rings at her ass. I've always thought whenever I see bachelorette girls running around Vegas with their penis hats on... &gt;&gt; KIM: Look! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look! Sipping their penis straws... Like, "Who runs around with this disgusting penis stuff on?" And of course, Kim and I are buying it all for Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think we've pretty much got everything we would possibly need. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're an only child. That means the next generation you're going to have at least six or seven kids. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: At least. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going to have six or seven? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, you're going to have... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want one kid to be just like me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Maybe a little better. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's this? &gt;&gt; MALE REPORTER: And apparently Los Angeles Laker Lamar Odom is getting married. <i>People</i> magazine reports that after one month of dating, Odom is engaged to Khloe Kardashian. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can you believe this? They've been dating a whole month and now they're engaged? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think it's been two weeks, though, not a month. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come in here. So did you know anything about this? Is she actually engaged, yes or no? It's a simple question. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's pretty simple. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes? Or no? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you mean "yes or no"? Come up with an answer. Is she engaged or not? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's on the news, Rob. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, you would know. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She is engaged. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not funny. She's gonna marry the guy? &gt;&gt; ROB: She seems really happy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, she doesn't know the guy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think it's a bit crazy that no one filled you in on it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe thinks that you're going to react in a bad way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I think any father would be a little bit upset about something like that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They shouldn't hide it from you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not like I'd have a bad reaction; I'm like, I'm this horrible person. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like, "Oh, no!" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Anybody would react that way. I mean, it's ridiculous. What has my life come to? I'm watching the news to find out what my children are doing. Although I'm not the genetic dad, I've been with Khloe since she was five years old. You would think she would feel the right thing to do, and that would be to call before it got into the media. And it's also hurtful because I think my wife knew. Uh, honey, I was just watching the news. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And they had a thing that, uh, Khloe and Lamar are engaged. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, I can't hear you. I'm going through the canyon. Khloe's in front of me, so we'll be there in a minute. Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe. Bruce just called me when I was driving, and he said, "What's going on?" And I said, "What do you mean what's going on?" And he said, "I was just listening to the 5:00 news, and it says that Lamar and Khloe got engaged." I want to go find Bruce, and I just want you to know that he already knows. That last thing that I want to do is have Bruce get his feelings hurt. That's been my fear all along. The fact that he would find out about this and it wasn't one of us telling him. I'll be the mediator, since no one's going to say anything. Bruce just saw the 5:00 news, and it said that you and Lamar just got engaged. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, and is that a bad thing? A lot of people... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've got to listen to the news to find out that you're engaged? You've known this guy for what, a month? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So? You married my mom after five months. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Five and a half months-- a whole different situation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Totally, when you've been married twice before. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't give me this, Khloe, like, "Oh, you're right." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're so much better than me, I forgot. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Tell me this-- I've got to listen-- I've got to find out that you got engaged to some guy that you've known for a month on the news. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Tell me that's right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. Then I'm done with the conversation, if you're gonna be an &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just... you asked me if it was... you just said! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want to talk to her if that's what her attitude is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You said is this true. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All she had to do is make a phone call-- yesterday. "You know what? I got engaged. You may hear it on the news." &gt;&gt; KRIS: She isn't engaged yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get my ring Sunday. We haven't even got engaged yet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's not engaged. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You are engaged, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not engaged yet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're wrong. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm wrong for what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're wrong. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not wrong! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, what really bothers you, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have a nice life. Screw you, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I guess you won't be walking anybody down the aisle. &gt;&gt; ROB: When they don't tell you things, that's not cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe I'm not your genetic father, but I am your father. &gt;&gt; ROB: I feel bad for Bruce. He just feels like he's not part of the family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm done. I can't take it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce and Lamar never met. It's going to be their first time at dinner. Everyone is stressing out about tonight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not wrong! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have a nice life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have a nice life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Screw you, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I guess you won't be walking anybody down the aisle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Screw me because? &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom, shut up. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, he's right. I'm serious. You're being really rude. No one told him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes, you are. You don't even care about your husband. Bible, Mom. That's really rude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is crazy. Everyone's yelling at everyone, and Khloe is such a mess. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't say anything. He said, "Tell me if this is right. Are you..." He said something, "Are you engaged to a guy you met a month ago?" I said, yeah. And then he goes, "You're an " &gt;&gt; KENDAL: I think he could have meant, "Is this right?" as in "Is this right to do?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's hurt right now because he feels left out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not fair to put that on me, though. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ROB: I yelled at... I yelled at Mom because I completely agree with you. You should have been the first person, or one of the top... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A phone call saying, "You know what, tomorrow in the media, it's going to go all over the media that I'm engaged. You know what? It's right. I am engaged. We're buying the ring on Sunday." Okay, that's all I need to know. &gt;&gt; ROB: I feel bad for Bruce. I feel like he just feels like a different person, like he's not part of the family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And then she comes in with this attitude. "Why should I tell you?" Well, I happen to have raised you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe I'm not your genetic father, but I am your father. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been here since you were five years old. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It would just be the appropriate thing to do. It's just her attitude. So, if that's case, great, I'm done. I'm done. I can't take it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to go see what Bruce is doing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I really don't want you to go yell at him. Honestly, Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's fine. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Please, Mom, don't yell. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not going to yell. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you just stop walking for a minute? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm done. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But how's... What about Mom? That's the problem. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know where to go from here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know where to go from here either. I think I'll just stay right here. &gt;&gt; ROB: Weren't we supposed to have a family dinner? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have no idea. How about McDonald's? You want to go to McDonald's? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Listen, this is going to get... unless... We're the adults here. They're the children. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She knew it was out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, she didn't. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Do you want me to say something? Because you can't say something without yelling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: She did... This is what she told me. She didn't know it got out. Someone leaked it to someone, and it got out, and everyone knows about it now. It wasn't her that told someone. It's not her fault. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're right. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: You get that she wanted to tell you in person. Is that so hard to believe? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe and I have had a really good relationship throughout the years. And uh, I don't want lose that close relationship over this thing. Here's the deal. Tell Khloe to come up here and all you guys leave. Just me and Khloe. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: You better not yell. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just me and Khloe. I'm not yelling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe? Khloe to my bedroom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get out. Quit, everybody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please. Can I stay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. You're leaving. Good-bye. Khloe and I. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This sucks. Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. Sit down right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Lay down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll sit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So you can relax. Just lay down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, don't sit down. Lay down. I want you to be relaxed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I see your Laker-colored shoes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, that's a coincidence. It's a coincidence. All right, love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Totally. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, uh, I'm sorry this went down that way, especially downstairs. I apologize, okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know I'm not your genetic dad, but I've pretty much raised you since you were five years old. That's kind of a really big deal when your daughter gets engaged. Wouldn't I be one of the first phone calls? No? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you would, but I wanted to... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You don't even know him. You don't even know him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm just saying... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I'm saying okay. I'm not arguing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I mean, there's, um... I hope this is going to be a very long engagement. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think so. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? What's the rush? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's no rush. We just want to get married within the next couple weeks. We're planning it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Couple of weeks? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: These two people are strangers to each other. They don't know each other. They're just working on adrenaline and hormones right now. You don't know this guy. It's going to be like Kimberly running off to Vegas when she was 19. And she didn't know who the hell this guy was. I'm just saying, this is the wrong thing to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not sitting here trying to declare or justify anything to anyone. This is just the decision. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow. Okay. You do what you want to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Hold on. Kylie wants to say something to you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi, Lamar. Hi, future brother-in-law. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is my engagement. I'm supposed to be so happy, over the moon and really excited. I'm just not anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to get married. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You could wear that dress. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel very at peace, very comfortable in my own skin, very secure. That's just not what I've ever had before. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? &gt;&gt; SHARON: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good to see you. Sharon Sachs has come to the house to go over some specific wedding details. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Should we wait for your mom? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is she? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me tell her. &gt;&gt; SHARON: You're going to love it, I think. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She did both of the Lopez weddings. &gt;&gt; SHARON: The level of taste. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SHARON: And when she phoned me and she said to me, "Do you mind doing this? Will you do this for me again?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That shows how much she loved you. &gt;&gt; SHARON: I loved it. And here I have her photographer doing your wedding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, no way. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wedding planners? &gt;&gt; SHARON: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce, this is Sharon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't know we had a wedding planner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Hi, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She did Allison's. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just found out there's going to be a wedding about an hour ago. Now wait a second. A few days ago this same person-- the wedding planner-- was in my house. Kris lied to me. Kris has known that this wedding's been going on for <i>days.</i> Honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was, uh, just downstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And they have the wedding planners. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Which, the wedding planners were here like what, two days ago, three days ago? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, if you knew Khloe was getting married two days ago... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why didn't you tell me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Give me... Give me your excuse. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But it's a trick question. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just going to sit here and, like, watch guys racing cars, having fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I'm just, like, done with this whole thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whatever relaxes you. Okay, well, we'll let you know when it's all taken care of. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, here's a show you should watch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: <i>Are You Smarter than</i> <i>a 5th Grader?</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ciao. Ta-ta. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I told you a million times that that was going to happen if you didn't tell him earlier and he had to find out some other random way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. And I told you I wasn't going to tell anybody until I had rings to say I'm engaged. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just have to remember that he's coming from a loving place. You know, he made your dad a promise, when your dad was dying, that he would be the one to take care of you girls. He feels so responsible and that's why he's the tough one, and, Khloe, he's just hurt. He will come around. You watch and see. If I were you, I would go to him and ask him if he would walk you down the aisle. I know that's what you want at the end of the day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't feel like asking him to walk me down the aisle. I am so hurt by Bruce's reaction. Even if I did ask him to walk me down the aisle, there's no way he would want to even do it. I am honestly just way too emotionally drained to even have this conversation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's spent the majority of his life trying to take care of all of us. You hear me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I look and see all these boxes, start opening up the boxes. What are they? Hmm. Wedding dresses. And a lot of them. All from Vera Wang. Where do you guys want this stuff? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, I want to see what they look like. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want to know, how did these girls get Vera Wang dresses in, like, two days? This is a tragedy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your dresses are up here if you guys want to start. Obviously, Bruce is upset, but we are all so excited to see Khloe in her wedding dress. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Kris, are you ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm ready. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Are you sure that you're ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm ready! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Are you sure that you're ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I'm ready! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Come here! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's pretty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's not tied properly in the back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just so amazing to see Khloe. This is... This day is all about her and just seeing her, you know, with her glow and how happy she is, um, is really amazing to see. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When he sees me, you guys are gonna be like... He's going to really love what he sees. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Honey, he already loves what he sees. &gt;&gt; KHADIJA: Exactly. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: This is going to throw it over the top. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This dress is so beautiful and every time I put it on, I honestly feel like a princess. This is turning into my fairytale wedding and I'm so happy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know that you really like your dress... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Mom, I'm not wearing your dress. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But just in case... Wait, which wedding was this? I don't know if this was my first wedding or my second wedding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously, from the start, she's been trying to make this wedding all about her and now the dress? Like, come on. That is so ugly, I would die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe! This dress is not ugly! That is really mean! You hurt my feelings. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I felt like Kris was making this all about her and I know I reacted a little bit out of line, but I do have to be more respectful and appreciative of the fact that my mom is throwing this wedding together in nine days. I love you, Mommy. I just wanted to say I'm sorry about the whole wedding dress situation. I appreciate how much work you've put into this. I know it's stressful on everyone: on me, on you, on everyone. So I appreciate... Didn't mean to make you cry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know you didn't. I know that you're just really stressed out like I am. I just... I didn't expect to have, like, a... moment in the middle of all of this and I was telling those girls that I just waited, like, my whole life to be able to show one of you girls that dress and I just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, and I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Didn't expect... I didn't even think it would mean that much to me until I pulled it out of the box. I thought it was kind of funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just said I'm sorry because... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I don't mean to hurt your feelings, so I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have lip gloss on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everybody's stressed out and, at the end of the day, it needs to be all about Khloe. Going forward, I am going to make sure that Khloe realizes that this wedding is going to be all about her and not about me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'll try it on for you now. I want to make my mom happy, so I'm going to see how the dress fits on me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: '70s! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It was the '70s? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 1978. &gt;&gt; KIM: ♫ The hills are alive... ♫ I feel like I'm in <i>The Sound of</i> <i>Music.</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: But I want to get married. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You could wear that dress. Well, Khloe doesn't want to try my dress on, but Kim looks beautiful in it, and it fits her like a glove. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, you guys. Do you know that Rob asked Adrienne to come with him as his date? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Why did he do that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, Khloe invited her. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, no, no, that's not... The discussion is Rob asked would she, like, be his date. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob asked Adrienne to be his date for the wedding and she said that, you know, he can tag along with her and her friends. It's not looking too good for Rob. That's not a date. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's going to, like, kill Rob. &gt;&gt; KHADIJA: That's convenient. I love Adrienne, but that's convenient for her and it may hurt Rob later. I don't like the idea. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing, buddy? &gt;&gt; ROB: Adrienne hit me up and was like, "Do you want to go to the wedding?" You know? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't believe she's... &gt;&gt; ROB: But as friends, like with her... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Amigos? That's an absolute no. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, well. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, in that case, you might as well tape your back and make pretend you got a mangina on deck. You'll go with me. You'll meet her at the wedding on your own turf. I know Rob really cares about Adrienne, cares about her feelings, but if he doesn't watch what he's doing, he's going to end up as a complete friend who looks completely desperate to her. I think you could tell her whatever you really are feeling when you're there. I just don't think you need to put yourself out there and be calling her and trying to go to the wedding with her, with her friends. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know how crazy I... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not a date. I know you are, but please, just let it happen. If you see her and things go well and it's meant to be, it will. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I believe that it could work out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hopefully, she sees the good in me and realizes I'm... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, you are a good guy. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You unfortunately broke up over reasons that were not great for you, but if you really are a good guy and want to change, I'm sure she would be willing to take you back. You just have to be a gentleman. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kourtney took you back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, you... Don't compare yourself to me. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott really does have a good point about going to the wedding with the guys and my best bet is to just see Adrienne at the wedding and see what happens. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Done. You're coming with me, then. &gt;&gt; ROB: Fine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mazel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Lamar and Khloe are going to be here in five minutes, you guys. Five minutes. This is an important night. This is the first time that Lamar is going to have dinner with us as a family. He's... This is a lot of drama for somebody to take in on a first night, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...with a driver to take me to the wedding. Um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Of course you are. I, like, don't even get that you're talking about Rolls Royces and I need to cook dinner. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone is stressing out about tonight. Bruce and Lamar have never met. It's going to be their first time at dinner and I just hope it goes well. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, that one's done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! Hi! How are you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can I get you something to drink? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hold on. I don't want anybody to get burned. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, doll. Mmm. I bet you need a hug. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is the first time I'm going to meet Lamar. This is going to be a tough one for me. I mean, this is really hard to welcome this guy into my home. I don't even know him. And he's marrying Khloe. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: His middle name was Christopher and I think that's what you should go with... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sorry, Brucey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sorry, Bruce. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You want me to get you a plate, Bruce? You sure? All right, all right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce is being so rude to Lamar. He doesn't even shake his hand when he arrives and he doesn't even introduce himself at the dinner table. Bruce's reaction to my engagement was not good. No one is going to mess this up. I'm in love with Lamar and it's just not going to happen that way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Would you marry me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get back. Get into the house. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe has asked Rob to walk her down the aisle, but you know, Bruce raised Khloe. It's going to create a huge, huge problem between her and Bruce down the road. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What questions? He doesn't know any answers. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I got to... No, wait a second. About the wedding... &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you have... You don't have a brother. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No. I'm an only child. I'm an only child. No, no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When you were how old? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: My mother passed away when I was 12. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 12? No way. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, and my parents... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so weird. I'm overhearing some of Bruce's and Lamar's conversation and they're really opening up to each other. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Westchester County. Wow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hear them talking about the Olympics and talking about their family history and it's just getting deep, which I'm surprised Bruce is going all in with Lamar. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, getting in the game and and being competitive. It's about doing the work when nobody's watching. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, it's about pushing yourself. It's about driving yourself. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I look over and there's Bruce and Lamar talking and sharing all these stories together and they're, like, suddenly new BFFs. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yes. Thank you, sir. Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So let's do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hear, hear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All the way, babe. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's what it is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Although I don't know Lamar yet, I have a lot of respect for him. I mean, he grew up in New York in a very tough situation; lost his mom at a young age. He's been through a lot. He's been extremely successful. I mean, those are a lot of great qualities that any dad would like to see in this situation, but, uh, I certainly don't think they should get married right now. That's kind of where I'm at. So it's gonna take more time for me to warm up. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Khloe... &gt;&gt; GIRL: That's okay. You can interrupt the moment. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Have you ever been in love before? You ever been in love before? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-mm. What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; GIRL: This makes it real. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This ain't no joke. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Would you marry me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MAN: You better hang on forever, Khlo. &gt;&gt; Yay! &gt;&gt; GIRL: Wait, Khloe. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Whoo! &gt;&gt; BOY: Mazel tov! &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, it couldn't be... it could not be... Khloe's ring is gorgeous. I'm sure in the back of her mind she's always dreamed of a nice big ring. She just has never expressed it the way some other people do. But it's pretty huge and amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you love the setting? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. To see the look on Khloe's face and her amazing diamond rock that she got, I mean, it's such a magical moment, and I'm so glad that Lamar chose to share it with everyone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm engaged! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I didn't have the right diamond. Oh, mama... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel very at peace, very comfortable in my own skin. Very secure. I'm literally in his sleep; every time he wakes up and he moves, he tells me he loves me when he rolls over. That's just not what I've ever had before. &gt;&gt; BRAD: Oh. Oh, my. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa. &gt;&gt; BRAD: Whoa, that's a rock. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; BRAD: Very nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just got married. Now I can tell you! I'm engaged! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now you can tell me 'cause you were gonna wait for the ring! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, and now you know why. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The bottom line is I respect Khloe's decision. It's her life, and I'll stand by her and be behind her and just absolutely hope for the best. I want Khloe to be happy. I want Lamar to be happy. That's all I'm trying to do. And hit the golf ball straight once in a while, too. &gt;&gt; <i>Hasta la vista.</i> &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye, guys. You can go home and bone now that you have your bling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're not allowed to bone. He's holding out on me until the wedding night. &gt;&gt; Use that thing! &gt;&gt; KIM: We love you guys. See you later. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Got a little carried away. Kim and Kourtney decided to throw me a bachelorette party, which I never wanted. I specifically said, "I do not want a bachelorette party." &gt;&gt; ALL: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KIM/KOURTNEY: Yay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I love... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Okay, so, I'm thinking the best thing that we can do now is go around and tell a really funny story about Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I remember we were, I took you on your favorite vacation ever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Africa? &gt;&gt; KIM: To Africa. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A 22-hour flight with Kim and Reggie was not fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: A 22-hour flight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: During the breakup, sitting on, like, a confined area is not fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: 22 hours, and we were, like, there was one point where I was crying on the plane, fighting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not crying; screaming, crying, and I'm, like, "We're in first class. Please be quiet, please?" And she goes, "I don't care if anyone can hear me! I don't care!" &gt;&gt; KIM: It was the most torturous trip ever, and I really feel like within a year, I mean, within a month, so much has changed. Like, I feel like our roles have reversed. And it's really cool, and I'm really, really happy for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks, Joji. &gt;&gt; KIM: And now you have a man that'll take you on better vacations than my torturous trips I bring you on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously. &gt;&gt; KIM: I apologize in public. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your trip was fun. Here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. I am so happy for Khloe. This is such an exciting time. And I know that Khloe has kinda held back on sharing her love for Lamar 'cause she knows that I'm a little bit sad about Reggie, but it has nothing to do with that now. This is Khloe's time. And I'm so happy for her. &gt;&gt; Yay, Khloe! &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, girls, we're going to the room. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have vodka! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who would actually bake something like that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think moms are supposed to go to bachelorette parties, and there's a reason for that: no mom should have to look at all these penises. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you think this means at a bachelorette party? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get the door. For the last time it's gonna be Khloe Kardashian. I'm just excited. I just want to be married. &gt;&gt; ALL: You're getting married tomorrow! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When it is true love, you just know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, guys, what do you think this means at a bachelorette party? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: How you doing, sweetie? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, "sweetie." I'm good. How are you? &gt;&gt; MAN: What's wrong with this this picture? There's nothing but ladies in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: If I ever have a bachelorette party, my mom is definitely not coming. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: In my day, we had wedding showers. It was really civilized. Now it's just wrong. Thanks, but no thanks. I am outta here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Those are tight little panties you got on, huh? &gt;&gt; MAN: They are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think we're definitely all getting the impression this man is not much of a stripper, and he's more a men's go-go dancer. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm all about having a good time, but this guy, this stripper, is just way too close for comfort. He just really grosses me out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can stay as long as we can play this game with you. And if you don't want to do ring toss, then you can't stay. &gt;&gt; No, no, by all means, play. Play, by all means. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you gonna dance with this belly in the way? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Being at Khloe's wedding rehearsal is definitely making this all seem so real. The day before the wedding, we're all getting really exited. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Ladies and gentlemen... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: The faster we listen to Sharon, the faster we can have a little cocktail. &gt;&gt; SHARON: So what's gonna happen is you're gonna come down the aisle, and then the bridesmaids are coming up these stairs. The groomsmen are walking up these stairs, okay? On the right are the groomsmen. On the left are the bridesmaids. Got it? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Got it. &gt;&gt; SHARON: And now... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna give you a high five on that. &gt;&gt; SHARON: We bring Khloe. Faster, faster. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe has asked Rob to walk her down the aisle at her wedding, and... I just... I don't know. I don't really think that it's the best thing. You know, Bruce raised Khloe, so he's definitely more of a father figure. &gt;&gt; MAN: So who will have the rings? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, Kourtney 'cause Kim will probably steal mine, so I'll hold this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can I keep the ring down my boob? &gt;&gt; MAN: Whatever you want. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What if I had it in my vagine and I had to get it out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! Pregnant vagina? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it's so pretty. Flowers. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: My favorite, favorite, favorite. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, it's so pretty. Look how nice they did it. Wow. It's wedding rehearsal dinner at The Lobster, which is Lamar's favorite restaurant in Los Angeles. &gt;&gt; MJ: Hi. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It really feels wonderful to have the whole family together again tonight. And it means so much to Khloe to have all of us supporting her, loving her, and we're so happy for her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me, excuse me. Thank you, everyone, for coming. I know this has been thrown together in ten days. Um, so, and my mother helped a thousand percent. This could not have been done without my mom. Mom, Lamar and I wanted to give you a present just to say "Thank you." For all your support, for supporting us, being happy for us. I know you haven't been sleeping. I know all of that, and we appreciate it because we know this is right and what we want to do, and we love that you have been encouraging the entire way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really want to thank my mom for putting this entire wedding together in nine days. I mean, just this dress rehearsal dinner alone, it's amazing. &gt;&gt; GIRL: What a big party! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a birthday party. This is in honor of Kathy, everybody-- Lamar's mom. This is the anniversary of her birthday, and we felt that it was really important... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's a big-time cake. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...as Lamar's new family and support team that we are also embracing Kathy. And tonight, we just want to wish her a happy birthday. The most important person in Lamar's life is his mom Kathy, and Kathy passed away when he was about 12 years old. And I thought that would be a nice way for Lamar to know that we are so sensitive to the people that are so important to him, and that he's lost, just like Khloe lost her dad. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's the one thing that people don't know. So that was the, like, the draw. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can I have everybody's attention here for one second? One second? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First, I never expected Bruce to even say something. I just feel like Bruce is kinda like the more silent guy who's just, like, "Whatever." He just kinda rolls with the punches. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Um... And sometimes, like, Khloe, and people that are young don't realize truly what this commitment is. I know maybe I shouldn't say anything, but sometimes you just have to. And there's something I gotta to get off my chest right now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you miss Rob? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 'Cause we all miss you, Adrienne. &gt;&gt; ROB: I haven't spoken to her in about six months. And it's just killing me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can I have everybody's attention here for one second? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MAN: We got a winner like Bruce Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One second. Khloe, you came into my life when you were five, just turning six years old. Um, and I have to admit, maybe because you were the younger one and everything, but I think throughout the years, we have had a very special relationship. : The one person that's missing here tonight-- I know who's looking down on you and smiling-- that's your dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't cry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Um, about two weeks before your dad passed away, I talked to him. And I told him, I said, "Hey, look, if I was in your position," I said, "what would really bother me, is not about me, it would be about my children." And I told him I would always be there for you kids. And I hope I have. Which brings me to Lamar. We've known each other a few days now. And, uh, of course you can understand any father's concern when his daughter comes up to him and says, "I've known this guy a month and we're getting married in a week." But I just want to say that, just in the few days, in the time that I've had a chance to spend with you, I think Khloe's made a wonderful decision. So I said to her father that I'd always take care of her. Now she's your responsibility. And good luck, big guy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have never seen Bruce cry in my life. I don't think anyone has. To see Bruce cry and see Bruce get that emotional and that choked up about everything, it just... it meant so much to me. And okay, like, Bruce would never do that if he didn't like Lamar. Bruce would never put himself out there if he didn't agree with the situation. He might not have agreed with it at first, but Bruce definitely came around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me a kiss. You're a good daddy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: See you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I talk to you a second? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, I think you've done such a good job at not trying to force being the dad role on us... that you've done such a good job at letting it gradually just happen. And I don't think we've really given you credit for that. You're someone in my life that I've known since I've been five, and that has been, even if it's said or not, been an incredibly strong male figure in my life, which we don't have many of. And uh, we don't, I think, treat you with enough respect, as one of our father figures. You're just such a strong man in that way, which you deserve a lot of credit for, that I don't think you get. But, um, what I wanted to know is if... I thought it over, and if you would be willing to walk me down the aisle tomorrow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would be nothing but honored... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...to walk my little Khloe the aisle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yay. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Are you going to cry? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think I'll probably cry. But when everyone is... &gt;&gt; KIM: I would not cry at my wedding 'cause I would ruin my makeup. Like, you can't go through all of that and then ruin all your makeup. It's the night before the wedding and we're all in our big suite just having our last real single girls' night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is it weird that I'm, like, not nervous? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I think it's normal. Everyone's reaction's different. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm completely fine today. I don't feel nervous. I'm more excited. I'm more like, okay, I got to get there. I want to see the inside where the reception is. I want to see all the flowers and just see him standing at the end of the aisle. I'm just excited. For the last time it's going to be Khloe Kardashian you guys are sleeping with. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you, Khloe Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good night, Khloe Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't ruin my spray tan. I'm just excited. I just want to be married. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're getting married! &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, you look huge in a robe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Huge-- you look like Santa Claus. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ho-ho-ho. I just thought I could do a performance on Christmas Eve. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you not think it's so weird how like, you're knocked up and I'm about to be married? Miami cursed us. Single sisters in Miami. Now it's... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was like our goal in life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But was... we like, fulfilled our goal and now they're like, oh okay, now someone has to get pregnant and someone has to go get married. &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought that both would be me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And we thought going there, we were like, we can't bring that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...that boring bitch who has a boyfriend. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just a few months ago, Kourtney and Khloe went off to Miami to go live this single, crazy partying life. And I was, you know, Betty Crocker at home in my few-year-long relationship. And you know, they're back. Kourtney's pregnant; Khloe's getting married; and I'm so happy for Kourtney and Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're getting married tomorrow! My baby is about to plop out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can we get this show on the road? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like today is going to be the first day of the rest of your life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The beginning to my everything. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're getting married! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just getting more and more anxious. I'm just thinking like, don't trip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, everybody, listen up. We have 35 minutes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Miss Thing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Does Mom use this stuff? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never use it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. Yes, our dresses. &gt;&gt; MAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I'll just take them. The morning of the wedding Khloe does get overwhelmed when there's a lot of people around and so much going on that I just wanted to let her know that this is your day and nothing else matters but you. How does it feel to be, like, queen of the day? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like this would be, like, your dream. I really don't care. Do you, like, wish you were queen of the day? &gt;&gt; KIM: You know I don't, honey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just excited. Like, I'm just like, can we get this show on the road? &gt;&gt; KIM: Today is going to be the first day of the rest of your life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The beginning to my everything. Word? &gt;&gt; KIM: Word. &gt;&gt; KRIS: To Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: To Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am in such a daze. My heart is racing so fast. I'm so nervous. Seeing it all come to life is so amazing. The ten-piece orchestra and the flowers, everything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow, it's happening in moments. We're all going to walk down the aisle. And I haven't had a lot of time to digest the whole significance of this moment. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just so surreal. A family friend lent Khloe their house and it looks so gorgeous. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Yeah, you can move it in more if you want. All the way to the wall. No, that way. You have a car in the front of the house? You got to move 'em. They got to be gone. Thank you, guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So I noticed more and more guests getting to the wedding, and then I noticed Adrienne. I figured I'd go over and try to put in a good word for Rob, 'cause, let's be honest, he needs it. They got a little pork chop over there? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We already know what time it is. Adrienne. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know you're here for Rob and not just Khloe. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I'm here for the family. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And the family better known as Rob. Do you miss Rob? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 'Cause we all miss you, Adrienne. All aside, I'm happy you're here, even if it's for Khloe. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: So when are you getting married? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob and you have to tie the knot first. That was always the deal. I can't believe you flew in for this. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just for Rob. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: It's a big occasion. You're a Get me a drink. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not a bartender, Adrienne. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Veils are so ugly. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe, no, it's not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! Look, I look like I'm going to go bee hunting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bee hunting? What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you hate the veil, don't wear the veil. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, Khloe, that looks so pretty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How you guys doing? &gt;&gt; GUEST: Good. How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's a little anxiety. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't worry. Don't worry. Calm down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need a mirror. &gt;&gt; KIM: Calm down. You look gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right foot first. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your dress is stunning. &gt;&gt; MAN: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's do it. You're getting married! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm standing in the guest house and I see my sisters and everyone walking out one by one. I'm like, losing each one. I'm like, okay, we're getting a little bit closer and little bit closer. I'm just getting more and more anxious. I'm about to walk down the aisle and my heart is racing. The last three weeks have gone by so fast. I mean, now I'm getting married. I just can't believe I'm actually doing this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've never seen Khloe happier. And I think when it is true love, you just know. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: I Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I Khloe... &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: Please rise. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: It's a joy to welcome each of you to this sacred and joyful occasion as we celebrate the union of Khloe and Lamar, and it's now my privilege to ask, "Who gives this woman to be married to this man?" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My wife Kris and I. We do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce must be so proud and excited. He has looked forward to this moment for many, many years. Oh! Delicious. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: I've had the privilege of getting to know both of you a bit and I know the hope that you have for a joy-filled journey through life as husband and wife. &gt;&gt; ROB: For me to see my sister so happy and, like, finally she found someone. I definitely, definitely think that this will last. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: So if you're ready, Lamar, if you'll take your ring for Khloe. Place it on her finger and as you do, please repeat after me. "I, Lamar..." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I, Lamar... &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "Give you this ring." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Give you this ring. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "As a promise and symbol." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: As a promise and symbol... &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "Of my heart and faithfulness..." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Of my heart and faithfulness. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "My love and commitment to you." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: My love and commitment to you. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "When I'm angry, I will seek to be kind." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: When I'm angry, I will seek to be kind. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "When we speak, I will be truthful." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: When we speak, I will be truthful. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "And each day of my life..." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: And each day of my life... &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "I will be faithful to you." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I will be faithful to you. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: Khloe, if you'll place your ring for Lamar on his finger, and as you do, repeat after me. "I, Khloe..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I, Khloe... &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "Give you this ring." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Give you this ring. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "As a promise and symbol." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: As a promise and symbol. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "Of my heart and my faithfulness." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of my heart and my faithfulness. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "My love and commitment to you." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My love and commitment to you. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "When I'm angry, I'll seek to be kind." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When angry, I will seek to be kind. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "When we speak, I will be truthful." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I speak, I will be truthful. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "And each day of my life..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And each day of my life... &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: "I will be faithful to you." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will be faithful to you. &gt;&gt; OFFICIANT: Because of your desire to build a marriage for the ages, because of the rings you have given, from this day forward, you are husband and wife. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoo! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe is married! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've never seen Khloe happier and I think that when it is true love, you just know. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: I see Adrienne across the room and I haven't spoken to her in about six months and it's just killing me and I need to talk to her right now. &gt;&gt; ROB: It is kind of awkward. I'm just trying to make this situation as as comfortable as possible. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Please welcome to the floor Mrs. and Mr. Lamar Odom! &gt;&gt; ROB: Let me go say hi to my ex-girlfriend. &gt;&gt; MAN: Good to see you, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I see. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's her right here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Beautiful Adrienne. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Hi, baby. How are you? &gt;&gt; ROB: How you doing? Adrienne looks beautiful and I'm actually a little intimidated by her. &gt;&gt; ROB: At first it is kind of awkward and I'm just trying to make this situation as comfortable as possible. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Attention, party people in the place! Would you please welcome to the floor your groom and your bride, Mr. Lamar Odom and Miss Khloe Kardashian! All right, given the ring, right? Let's call her Khloe Odom! Let's go! Give them a round of applause, y'all! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: This room tonight is full of people that love and adore Khloe and Lamar. I love you so much and I'm so happy for you guys and you deserve it. Daddy would be very proud of you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Give them a round of applause, y'all. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Oh! &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, I'm trying to be as cool as possible with Adrienne, friendly and funny and, you know, remind her of the Robert that she used to love. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: All the single ladies. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Whoo! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: And never did I ever think that I would be the guy stuck with the purse. I know that I have to prove to Adrienne that I truly deserve a second chance and it's just going to take time. It's not going to happen overnight. Okay. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Round of applause to Jamie, y'all, our groom's best man. &gt;&gt; JAMIE: We welcome Khloe to our family and, uh, all of you here for Khloe and Lamar tonight. 12 years ago, Lamar's grandmother asked me to promise her that I'll always, no matter what, watch over Lamar, take care of him and always be there for him. Lamar's mom passed away a few years earlier and he had no brothers or sisters. So, tonight, Khloe, I ask you to honor that very same promise to his grandmother, that you will always support Lamar and stand by him because you have realized very quickly what the rest of us already know: It's very easy to love Lamar. God bless both of you on your special night. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Thank you, Jamie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I see a different side of Lamar than I think a lot of people see. So when he starts crying after his best man's speech, it doesn't really surprise me. It just really makes me respect him and I just really respect the man he is and I value his heart and his mind and it's just... I mean, he's a beautiful person. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Now I'd like to welcome Khloe's sisters and maids of honor, the beautiful Kim and Kourtney Kardashian. Give them a round of applause. &gt;&gt; KIM: We didn't really write anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We didn't write anything, but, um, in the short time that we've known Lamar, we can already tell that he fits into our family. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause when you date one of us, you kind of date the whole family, so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And Lamar's excited to be dating all three of us. &gt;&gt; KIM: The reception is the best part of this wedding. I mean, this is where, you know, we're really feeling the love that's you know, in this room and it's all of our closest friends and family members. And something that my dad does every single night at the dinner table, we'd say what the peak of our day was and what the pit of our day was, so the pit of our day... I... You can take over. You look prettiest. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The pit is that our dad isn't here, but the peak is seeing how happy Khloe is and Lamar and how happy Lamar makes Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: We love you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We love you guys. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe and Lamar, I wish you a life of health and happiness. Get ready for Kim and I to come sleep over at least once a week. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, by far, the best wedding I've ever been to. We will always be here for you guys, no matter what, and I love you very much and I cannot wait for this journey for you guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would like you all to join us in a very traditional Armenian dance. I'm just really happy for you and proud of you, Khloe. You're an amazing woman. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: This season on <i>Keeping</i> <i>Up with the Kardashians:</i> Leave her alone! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, do you like this house? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's the price? &gt;&gt; REALTOR: $5.9 million. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think this is the house. In the meantime, we can live in the car. If you want your dress back, you will listen to the following instructions. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need my dress! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want my damn ATM card! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Lately, she's just been so up and down. You know, we used to have sex every single day and now, it's like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Leave. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I can't catch a break. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're not even <i>into</i> it yet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Go to your room! &gt;&gt; ROB: I am freaking out right now. It hurts. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You do not want this to be the last erection you ever have. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scrawny little bitch! &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys make me feel like I'm the ones that have to get married and have a baby. I'm fine! It's just lie after lie. I have a stalker. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You should not go home, Kim. This is your life. What theare you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is about as dumb as you've gotten. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll either call the police or you don't spend time with her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, come on. He's brainwashing you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott is the father of the child, so you better get used to that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't have to get used to anything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're a sick! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Robbie! Rob! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hate him.
