- &gt;&gt; KRIS: Previously on <i>Keeping</i> <i>Up with the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm ready to do some bad things tonight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now, Scott... &gt;&gt; ROB: Get off of me! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott! Scott, stop it. Stop it, Scott. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Back off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't youtalk to me like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not going to go tell him anything. I'm not talking to him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want them to arrest him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need to do what's best for me and my baby. I'm done. Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you just let me in? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I changed the locks, and you don't need to be here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me in the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And tonight, the time is here for Kourtney's baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My water broke. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ew. The baby's coming. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; NURSE: His head is out. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You can do it. Push it, push it, push it. Yes, excellent. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not normal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on in. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wanted to talk to you for a little, if you're not busy. I lost my voice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not surprised. Scott called, begging to talk to me. I'm not excited, but I owe it to my daughter and to my grandchild to hear what Scott has to say. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I couldn't be any more sorry, and I'll never excuse the way I acted the other night in Vegas, but, like, I don't know what I ever did so bad to, like, deserve you to, like, hate me so much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't hate you. I-- and I can see how you would... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You treat Reggie and Lamar completely different than me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If Scott thinks that I treat him differently, it's because I do. I'll never be able to trust him with my daughter and my grandchild. I want the best for my daughter, and one of the reasons I have had an issue with you is that... : ...you know, she's just always felt like she has to baby-sit you. Like, you know, you're going to... do something that she can't handle. She's my whole life. I want her to be happy. I want her to be able to trust the person she's with and have respect for the person she's with and have somebody take care of her, not somebody that she has to be ashamed of, and for me to have to worry, that's just not okay with me. I don't know what he could ever say to me to make me understand his behavior. I'm not willing to let it go. I just can't have you in my family. It's too dangerous. Scott has really crossed the line. There's just no place for Scott in our family anymore. &gt;&gt; I gotta get my s[bleep] together. I can't live like this. My own girlfriend, who's pregnant with my child, will not answer my calls. &gt;&gt; J.J.: You can't have a conversation that starts off with, like, you admitting that you kind of screwed up a bit? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've tried. I've left messages, texts, e-mail, you name it. I really miss Kourtney. All I want to do is just be able to speak to her. &gt;&gt; VOICEMAIL: At the tone, please record your message. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney, it's Scott. Please, just call me back. I know you're going to the doctor, and it would mean the world to me to be there. We need to speak. Hey, it's me for the 99th time. I don't know what it's going to take for you to call me back. Please, just call me. I am worried that Kourtney may never speak to me again. I hope you're safe and I hope the little one's okay, and you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you feel kind of weird that he took you out of Mom's vagina, and now he's looked at all-- your vagina? He's like, "Oh, this piece looks just like your mother's." Like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What if it doesn't? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, she did have six kids; I had none. I would hope mine's tighter than hers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Hi, girls. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So come on in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Now that I'm in the last month of my pregnancy, I usually have Scott come with me to all my appointments, but since he's out of my life, I'm having Khloe come with me to my doctor's appointment and play the daddy. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So your baby is a little on the big side. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Slightly. What we're going to do-- not so much today, we still got a ways, but we're going to really-- maybe when your husband's here. Boyfriend, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're not really together right now. Whatever, it's fine. Scott is officially out of my life, and it's really starting to sink in that I'm going to raise my baby alone. It's just a really scary thought. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So here's the head. Here's the baby's spine. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you? In here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: <i>Hola.</i> Hi, baby. Oh, my God, guess what I heard today. Um, Roya told me that Danielle called her from Dash Miami. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And Erica is moving to L.A., so she's quitting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, Carrie quit last week. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And, you know, Lenny quit a couple months ago, so we... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So who's working at the store? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We only have two girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need people that we can rely on, not girls that are just going to ditch us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guess who came by the store today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Apologizing and just wanting to talk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know that I'm going to eventually talk to him. I'm not just going to ignore him forever. I mean, we are having a child together. 90% of the time, he is this great guy. He started working, but then he'll go and do that and it brings it back to how it was before where I'm like, "I don't even want to be with this guy." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is how Scott always was. It's not like Scott was, like, always down the straight and narrow road. He only became good because you got pregnant, not because he was really, like, this great, good guy. Just what do you want? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to put up with that or are you over it because you're having a baby? Just make up your mind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't untangle the chain. It's pretty... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I thought-- oh, it is a purple stone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing here, anyway? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're going to dinner with Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I almost forgot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My house... ...is, like, empty. Ugh, Scott is texting me again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you even talked to Scott since the whole Vegas thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's just texted me; I haven't been responding. Like, he'll-- definitely woke up today-- all these text messages I'm getting-- feeling embarrassed about what he did. You know, not everyone's perfect. He deals with my moods. He-He's normally, like, does everything for me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I thought we were done with Scott, but Kourtney has already started to make excuses for him. It sounds like she's considering taking him back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Him and Rob rile each other up-- and J.J.-- when they all get together. You know, they all... &gt;&gt; KRIS: But they're 22-year-old boys straight out of college... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And he's 26. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, but sooner or later, he's got to grow up, Kourtney. I told you this a long time ago, Kourtney, that you can't... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, well, don't you just know everything? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You should be treated like a princess. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, but he does 90% of the time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're going to spend the rest of your life making excuses for him. I just want you to be the best you can be and have the best thing going for you. I'm your mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I will figure it out. All right, I'm over this conversation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have been looking forward to giving a baby shower for one of my kids for as long as I can remember. Scott is not going to ruin this day. What is he doing here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My water broke. It's dripping down my legs. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: And push again. That's it. That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Push again, Kourtney. Push again. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really don't want to shut Scott out of my life completely, and this isn't just about me anymore. We're having a baby, and I need to do what's best for my baby, as well. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm happy you finally let me come see you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The way that you were acting was scary. It was, like, a completely different side of you that I have never seen. You know, my mom's running up to me, like, "Tell him. Get him out of here. Do this, do that." And I'm like, "I don't want to have to do that." 'Cause it's not my job. I'm going to... I'm going to be a mom now. I don't need to be <i>your</i> mom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's no excuse for my behavior in Vegas. Will I let that happen again? No. But you have to understand, sometimes it's not easy the situation I'm put in with your family. I feel belittled day after day, and eventually, it's likely that a person can break. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You just can't blame all this on my mom. Like, I've heard that so many times, and this relationship is about you and I. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I completely understand the point you're bringing up. Things were going well. I happen to have fallen off the path I was on, and I lost my head there for a minute and went back to my old ways, but in the bigger picture, there's nothing more I want to do than be here for you and that baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. You can be this great guy that I see in you every day. I mean, I obviously love you and want to make this work. Otherwise, I wouldn't be talking to you. People act like Scott is this awful, horrible person, but he's actually really good to me, and I really do want to make this work, and not just for our baby. I really want to make it work for me because I love him and I want to help him help himself. So, you know my baby shower's tomorrow. I was going to say that the guy usually stops by. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I would love that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That means a lot to me. You want a piece of me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You do? Let's get this show on the road. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me just start by saying that Kourtney's doctor is the same doctor that delivered Kourtney is delivering my first grandchild, which is one... this is, like, such a great day. Thank you. Is this a diaper? I have been looking forward to giving a baby shower for one of my children for as long as I can remember, and I just want Kourtney to know that she's going to have the most amazing family without Scott. Okay, I'm going to try not to cry. Kourtney, I love you so much. You're my firstborn. Thank you for doing this for me. Uh, just kidding. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am so excited about my baby shower. My mom, Kim and Khloe did such an amazing job. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. So good to see you. You look so pretty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks. Seeing all my friends who are young mothers really enforces the fact that I want to be a career mom. Lots of young mothers work and raise their children, and I'm confident that I can do both, too, even if that means working in Miami. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Two Onesies. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is exactly what Scott would like. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know that I shouldn't feel like this, but hearing Scott's name actually makes me cringe. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going to get married whenever the time is right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh! I stepped on you. Are you okay? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is he doing here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you? I got to get a water. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Seriously, what is Scott doing here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I want to say hi to my lovely pregnant woman first. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't tell my mom that I'm back with Scott and that I invited him to the baby shower because I really don't care what my mom thinks. This is my life and my choice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is he doing here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, this is my baby shower. He's the father of my baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just keep taking him back and taking him back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, Mom, this is my baby shower, and he's the father of my baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I understand that, but I want you to have a little self-respect. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is my life, and this is what it is. You should expect him everywhere that I am. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's the shower been? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Amazing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, to put the, um... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: The birth certificate. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Birth certificate. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that's great. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, that's so sweet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The holy grail. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, that's so cute. Who's it from? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott definitely screwed up with all of us, but Kourt wants what she wants. What can I do? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want a water, doll? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I'm so thirsty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's nothing I can do about Scott right now. It's Kourtney's decision, and I have to go along with it. Even though I don't agree with her, I'm going to accept the situation. For now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God! My water broke. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is kind of a big deal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh! There's water on the bed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think it's time for you to get ready. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. It's still leaking, you guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: The baby's coming, and we're packing. I'm so excited. Kourtney's leaking all over the place. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need a cup. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ew! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where's it going? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ew! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is anything going in it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. I don't want to see! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's dripping down my legs. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Shouldn't we be, like, in the car, like, on the way to the hospital? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're doing laundry? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I always thought, when your water breaks, it's going to be just like you see in the movies, where everyone gets so crazy, racing around, rushing to the hospital, and for some reason, I don't feel like that at all. I feel really good and calm and ready. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're gonna shower before you go into labor? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need to shave. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who gets clean before they go to the hospital? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Let's get clean so we get blood all over my vagina. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to be gross. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're putting makeup on to deliver a baby? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. There's pictures involved. Are you nervous? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not as nervous as I thought I would be. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I mean, I kind of just want him out already. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm excited to get him out, too, but... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Me, too. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do we have everything? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's get this baby on the road! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's almost 12:00 in the morning. Almost the 14th. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you excited to be an aunt? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, so excited. And the baby's birthday will probably be December 14. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's all happening. Very soon I'm gonna be a father. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How do you feel? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine. I, um, took a little nap. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you take a nap, Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've been waiting for her. What time is it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 3:01 a.m. Haven't slept yet. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, Bugs? It's Aunt Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do feel pressure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did you have your hair and makeup done to come here? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I was in the middle of a shoot and I left with my hair extensions hanging out. I go, "I gotta go." The doctor won't allow more than two people in the room. So, I'm hiding in the closet. I'm peeking out. I think Kourtney just ultimately wanted Scott there, my mom, Khloe and I. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Grab your legs and try to push the baby down. And do one more. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is happening this quick? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I see his head. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The head! &gt;&gt; CRANE: Grab another air, and push again. That's it, that's it. &gt;&gt; NURSE: His head is out. &gt;&gt; CRANE: You can do it. Push it, push it. Push it, yes. Excellent. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Push. Come on. You can push. &gt;&gt; NURSE: Three, four, five, six. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Very, very ready to have this little... &gt;&gt; NURSE: Let it out. &gt;&gt; CRANE: That's the baby's head right there. &gt;&gt; NURSE: Khloe, do you want to help with her foot? I need somebody to hold her foot back... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You really need help? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do it, Khloe. &gt;&gt; NURSE: It's here. &gt;&gt; CRANE: All right, deep breath, and let that air out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're so excited. I'm actually holding Kourtney's leg while she's giving birth. It's just beautiful. &gt;&gt; CRANE: He's got his eyes open. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney's acting like nothing is wrong. She just is so calm. She isn't even crying. I'm crying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I-I... Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can I pull him out? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That is so crazy. &gt;&gt; CRANE: There he goes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my... &gt;&gt; CRANE: It's a boy. There he is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He sounds so cute. &gt;&gt; CRANE: All right, now let-let go of that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Congrats, you guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's so cute. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've never seen Scott react this way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is unreal. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And it's just amazing. I'm just really excited for him and happy for him. &gt;&gt; CRANE: What did you name him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason. My baby is Mason Dash Disick, born December 14. He's the most amazing baby I've ever laid my eyes on. The experience was so indescribable and life-changing. And I can't believe he's all mine. How crazy... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at him looking at you, Bug. This is a huge, huge moment. When I see my little boy, I'm overwhelmed with joy. It's honestly like a little piece of me was just reborn. And I'm so happy I'm here with Kourtney. And I know it's only gonna get better in time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, I am so proud of you. And I can't wait to see you become the mom that you're just destined to be. &gt;&gt; CRANE: You see this, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How crazy you pulled out your own baby? Dr. Crane, he's like, "Oh, your baby's halfway out. Do you want to touch the baby?" And Kourtney's like, "Sure." And she just reaches down and pulls him out. And is like, "Oh, my child." And I'm like... I think you ripped something. Like, that's not normal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got a baby, guys. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's Uncle Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: He's got nipples. &gt;&gt; KIM: He looks exactly like my dad. He's so hairy and Armenian. It really shows how strong the Kardashian genes are. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's Jo G.O., and her publicists are coming with her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Isn't this a family meeting? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Don't be jealous 'cause you can't afford us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? &gt;&gt; SIMON: Such a family affair. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe and I decide to have a meeting 'cause we need to tell everyone something very important. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are we all here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe and I are-- don't cry, everyone-- are going back to Miami. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? You're going to take my grandson and go to Miami? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't rip a baby away from its grandmother. It's sick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're doing it for the store and for-- if we ever want open more Dash stores, we need this one to be successful. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: So what happened to Miami? The whole store like fell apart? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, just all the girls quit. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Going to Miami seems to be the right thing to do. I mean, half of my friends are down there and I want to open a club there. So this works out perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't you think it's time you girls get real about this thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY &amp; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you mean what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The Brucenator. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've been married to Lamar a couple of months and now you're gonna leave him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to. At all. I would rather stay here... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are things going that bad? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's just not... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is not... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That is so rude, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nobody would leave their husband after four months and go to Miami. And why are you leaving? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Dash was my idea, and I do so much work for the store still, and it's really important to me that it succeeds for Mason as well. I'm doing this for him and his future. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think you're both being irresponsible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well,, I don't want to go. So don't encourage me to stay here 'cause I want to stay here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? I think your marriage is a lot more important than a store. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agree. I think the same thing. I'm not really looking forward to going back to Miami. Only because I just got married and Lamar can't come with me 'cause he's in season. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is our business with our name on it. Like, we can't just let it go to the ground. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think that whole store is really so much of you and I, so I'll go. I'm not gonna stay the whole time, but I'll-I'll definitely come back and forth and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, be there to help. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would appreciate the help. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll be there the majority of the time. I just, you know, you gotta work with me, kid. Holla at me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll work with ya. Holla back. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Stop kissing the kid. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what? This is my nephew and I know what I'm doing. And I kiss him every single day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what? You're my sister. &gt;&gt; KIM: So leave me alone. Leave me alone. Stop, Khloe. Khloe, I have... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See, look at you.
