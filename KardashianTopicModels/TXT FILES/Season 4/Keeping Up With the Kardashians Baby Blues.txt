- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Reggie, feels really good to have you back. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you very much and I'm really happy you're here tonight. Honest to God. I really am. &gt;&gt; Whoo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The Bush and the Tush! The Bush and the Tush! The Bush and the Tush! The Bush and the Tush! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Reggie's back! Reggie's back! &gt;&gt; KIM: So after taking a few months apart, I think Reggie and I have realized that we really do need each other. And taking a second chance at it has made us really realize how much we love each other and that we don't ever want to be away from each other. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Reggie, how are you feeling about everything? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so happy that Reggie and Kim are back together. I love Reggie. And I know Lamar will get along great with him. He'll be a great addition to our family. &gt;&gt; Lamar, your friend's here. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh. &gt;&gt; Who's back there? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hey, you. &gt;&gt; Who is he? Hey, pal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at his pants. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Our friend, Liz, brought her baby over. I think Lamar and I would be such great parents. I love kids and he loves kids, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are Kim and Reggie? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here we go again. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hmm? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How was practice? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You tired? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hell, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today, Lamar and I are going on the <i>Chelsea Lately</i> show for our first on-camera interview as a married couple together. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You know, she may joke around. She may probably joke around with you. Think you're gonna become kind of, like, an NBA, like, player's wife type thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Totally. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right, we're ready for you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Coming. I'm here. &gt;&gt; CHELSEA: Oh, please welcome the happy newlyweds, Khloe and Lamar Odom. &gt;&gt; CHELSEA: Welcome, welcome. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: How're you doing? &gt;&gt; CHELSEA: I'm good. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You're good? &gt;&gt; CHELSEA: You just came from practice, right? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, I'm a little tired. &gt;&gt; CHELSEA: Okay, well, try and pep it up for five minutes. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I will. &gt;&gt; CHELSEA: And you're not pregnant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, I don't think so. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Soon. &gt;&gt; CHELSEA: "Soon"? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, soon. &gt;&gt; CHELSEA: Really? Why don't you just steal Kourtney's baby when she has that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will. Lamar and I have been talking about having babies pretty much since the day we got married. And we know we want a baby together. &gt;&gt; CHELSEA: But you guys are very affectionate. It's very erotic watching you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honey. &gt;&gt; CHELSEA: Yeah, I'm going to go up to my office and take a long nap. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mario was telling me in Albania or whatever... Is that a country? &gt;&gt; KIM: Albania, yeah. I think. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When someone's pregnant, once you have your leftover milk, the sisters have to suck the milk out, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, stop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, you do them a solid and, like, suck out the extra milk. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is disgusting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just don't call me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shh, be quiet. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Who is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Be quiet. Just-- Rob, stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob. Rob! Rob! &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop! Shh! : Hello? I feel so sick. Don't be mad at me. I don't know what happened. I just, like, ate something and I feel really sick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, let's go shopping! &gt;&gt; KIM: I just hung up on her. Why would you say that and call me out while I'm on the phone with her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause why lie? You're such a liar. The busier and busier Kim gets, the more she lies to get through the day. I think that she just lies her way through life to get what she wants. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honesty is always the best policy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, and, but what is the point? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to hurt their feelings. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not even a lie worth telling. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's an old saying "one lie leads to the next." &gt;&gt; ROBERT: It is. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not even lying. I'm, like, white lying. I'm, like, not lying about something serious. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What does that even mean? A lie is a lie is a lie is a lie is a lie. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Is a lie. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who cares? I think I'm, like, a little liar. Like not on important things. I don't lie about serious things. I lie about, like, little things. It's not that big of a deal. Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. Where are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: They're just checking my oil. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Check your oil? So, do you like my new dress? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. She looks like Little Bo Peep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Monica, I thought I was wearing that bikini. &gt;&gt; MONICA: She told me that you said she can wear it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you are such a pathological liar. &gt;&gt; KIM: Doesn't it look good on me? It's easier just to not really all the way tell the truth, and I just think it makes it easier on someone. All right, I'm hungry. Do you want to go get something to eat? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I thought you were so sick and you can't do anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am. I'm sick of you yelling at me! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We got to get the liar out of the house. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: That's true. See you, Brucey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye, Bruce. Love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Liar, liar, pants on fire. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know who I learned that from? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Who? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie used to do that to me. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She used to go, "I gotta kiss you." No, you gotta keep your mouth closed. That's what they do in Armenia. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. Lot of things. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have always been the girl that's wanted a "ginormous" family. I've always wanted a ton of kids. The idea of having babies with him, just makes me so happy. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hmm? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your boobs are the size of Alabama. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. I can't help it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you give Kim a call, 'cause we could wait here forever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's just always late. Kim is always late and she lies about where she is. When are you going to be here? Like you know whatever she says, like, add ten extra minutes onto that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hate waiting for people when we're supposed to be eating. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Especially when I'm pregnant and starving. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look who's showing up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, well, well. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've eaten half my food. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, thank you for ordering for me. Will you open this for me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's wrong? Do you have wet nails? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just got a manicure. Kim, you made us sit here waiting for you while you got a manicure? &gt;&gt; KIM: Polish change, honey. Polish change. You know what? Leave me alone. I needed a polish change. I have a photo shoot. What can I do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Such a liar. You really are. It's annoying. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not a liar. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, well, you pretty much are. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. &gt;&gt; TOY: ♫ Moo, moo, moo Here a "moo" there a "moo" Everywhere a "moo, moo" ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not on my boobs. &gt;&gt; TOY: ♫ Old MacDonald had a farm... ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A baby's going to be much worse. They're going to be bothering you much more. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So my doctor said that you have to have sex all the time when you're pregnant to be healthy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't let anyone twist your arm. You're living in sin. I'm not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Since you've a piece of paper, you're not living in sin? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honey, I've been living in sin for a long time. Now, it's just unprotected, so it's a different story. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, why? Are you trying to get pregnant? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what happens when you have a husband. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so you're trying to have a baby? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I'm late on my period. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to get too excited, but my period's late. I could be pregnant. I just love children and I want as many as I can take care of. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think you're just trying to get pregnant so you can be on my level. We could have kids at the same age. Scott! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you guys talking about? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I said now that I'm married, I don't use condoms. Who did he say that to? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's around town. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I can't... You guys... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No! I'm not! You guys... I can't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This morning, I'm at a photo shoot with Kim, Kris and Khloe for Famous Cupcakes. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, how are you?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so nauseous. I have... I'm apolog... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw. Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you throw up on me, though, I'll throw up on you back. That could be a fun game. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I woke up this morning for the cupcake shoot, I was so nauseous. I don't even know how I'm gonna do this shoot. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Move this out and move this in, and put that tier thing in the middle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have never had morning sickness in my life. The only time I've ever woken up and started throwing up in the morning was because I was drinking the night before. And I was not drinking the night before. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: You're fine. You need to get closer, okay, babe? Okay. Don't throw up on her, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She can, I'll just throw up back. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How obvious can you be, Khloe? I mean, throwing up in the morning at a photo shoot? It's definitely morning sickness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, let's do it. Waiting for these results, three minutes feel like three hours. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim, you could've just told us the truth. &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't mean to lie to you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Enjoy your flowers. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Way to go, Kim. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Waiting for these results, it's only three minutes. But the three minutes feel like three hours. So, you know that little thing that comes every month? &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just missed my period and I just took a test and it came up positive. I am pregnant and I can't keep this in. Like, I have to tell someone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you excited? I feel like you wanted to start a family from the start, so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When we were talking about it, he was like, "When do you want to get pregnant?" And I was like, "I don't know." He's like, "Well, I want you to have babies." And I was like, "Well, obviously." &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really excited that Khloe's pregnant. Her and Lamar are, you know, ready for kids and they're excited to have kids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just don't... &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot believe that all my sisters are going to be pregnant except me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, Kourtney's going to have... &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to get pregnant! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You cannot tell anyone. Not Reggie, not Mom-- no one. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, okay. Oh, my God! I cannot believe this. Have you talked to Khloe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, like, a couple hours ago. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Has she said anything to you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: About what? &gt;&gt; KIM: Nothing. Never mind. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? They're having problems already? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, they're not having problems. Relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tell me what's wrong. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, do you promise you won't say anything? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I swear. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have to promise you will not tell Kendall, Kylie, Kourtney, Rob, Bruce-- anyone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I promise. Just tell me what's going on, 'cause you're freaking me out right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe's pregnant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's five minutes! Is that why they got married? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. So she doesn't want anyone to, like, think that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's pregnant? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, she wants to wait. She hasn't even told Lamar yet. She just wants to wait... &gt;&gt; KRIS: She hasn't told Lamar? I can't think of anybody who would make a better mother than Khloe. I mean, this is crazy! I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, Mom, if you say anything, she'll definitely know it's me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not going to say a word. &gt;&gt; KIM: So do not say a word or I will kill you myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I got it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where is Kim? Should I call her? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes. Yes, you should. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey, Kim, it's Kylie and Kendall. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're waiting for you. We're ready to go to the beach. Let's go! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye. This is so annoying. Kim promised us she'd take us to the beach today. Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: I promise you I did not forget. I, I was just, like, jogging in the-- and there was this dog and it, like, ran in front of me. And I totally sprained my ankle. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, yeah, I'm totally fine. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: Get ready. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: If it hurts that bad, I don't want you to go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you so much for being so understanding. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No problem. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Love you. That kind of sucks. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yup. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Congratulations! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: On what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who said that? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Um, well... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And who told Mom? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Now my whole family knows, due to Kim's mouth. I'm so anxious for Lamar to come home from his road trip because I want to tell him in person. So I'm kind of stalling, I guess, until he comes home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, shut up. Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa. What are you guys doing? I thought you were going to the beach. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What up, dawg? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wasn't Kim supposed to take you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. She hurt her foot, her ankle. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She hurt her foot? Doing what? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Running, I guess. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kim running? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She tripped over a dog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She what? Tripped over a dog? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: A dog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I hope she's not lying to these little girls. You know, I've seen her do this before, and it's just not right. These little girls look up to her so much. Well, why don't we do something? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why not? So... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you said that with such enthusiasm. Come on, let's have a little more excitement. That's better. Yeah, I thought so, all right. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It kind of sucks that we didn't get to go to the beach. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, uh, I agree, but if Kim, you know, is not feeling good, you can't blame her for that. You got the flowers ready? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yup. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! My sweet little girls got Kimberly flowers. Okay, let's go. You got the flowers? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's Kim. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What happened to your leg? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just really thought that you guys would be more offended if I said I forgot. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim, you could have just told us the truth. No. Enjoy your flowers. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're going to the car. We don't want to stay here anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, like, that's a little dramatic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, they came all the way down here because they wanted to bring you flowers and do something nice, and they find out, what? That you're lying about this stuff. I mean, come on, Kim. I mean, it's just ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You started a lot of &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, but I didn't mean to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We need to sew your mouth shut. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: I promise I will never lie ever again. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you being serious or are you lying again? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know the kind of phone call I got from a little 11-year-old named Kylie? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, I said it was a secret between you and I on a private car ride. You decided to go and tell Mom. Why did you do that? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I just... I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim's out of control. She also lied to Kendall and Kylie and said that her ankle was sprained, and that's just a completely new low for Kim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You started a lot of &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, but I didn't mean to. My family has always known that I exaggerate, and what's the big deal? Chill out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You... Uh, you just... I don't know. We need to sew your mouth shut for multiple reasons. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe. Hey, Bruce. Are the girls here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, they're upstairs. Are you going to talk to them? &gt;&gt; KIM: Coming to apologize to them, make it better. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think that would be very appropriate. &gt;&gt; KIM: Girls. Girls? Hey, guys. Um... Okay, guys, I just wanted to say that I'm really sorry for lying to you guys. I thought I was doing the right thing in trying to spare your feelings and not hurt them, when at the end of the day, I ended up hurting you guys' feelings more. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So you were trying to not hurt our feelings by lying to us? &gt;&gt; KIM: I wasn't even thinking. Just by me lying, I just thought, I didn't want to hurt your feelings. I mean, that's not what I planned at all, and I just... It just has really, seriously, taught me, like, a sincere lesson. Look, I promise I will never, ever, ever lie ever again. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you being serious or are you lying again? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie... Give me a break, seriously. I'm here to, like, really tell you how I feel. So will you please forgive me? Kendall and Kylie just think I'm the biggest liar. They don't believe anything that I say. And I feel like such a bad person. And I just hope that, one day in the future, they'll forgive me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe and I, when we lived together, we used to cheer each other on. If she heard me having sex, she'd be like, "Go, Scott. Get it goin'. Go, Scott." She would scream from the next room if she heard the bed shake. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What kind of a pervert did I raise? Honestly. You guys are the biggest perverts I've ever met in my life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You must not be very sexual. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am sexual. I've been pregnant many times. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to use the restroom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You throw up because the hormones-- your body's getting used to a whole different set of hormones, so you get nauseous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If I have a, uh, massage at the Four Seasons here, can I use it there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think so. You should call and ask them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need a quarter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need to buy a tampon. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I just started my period. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel so bad. I feel really bad. When you think that you are, you get really excited. I could tell that she was getting really excited. I just feel terrible for her. To be so excited about something so precious, and then have it suddenly, you know, ripped away from you is devastating. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know, it'll happen in its own time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's going to happen for you, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, especially now, it makes you put things in perspective with what you want... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...in your life and don't want. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Also, I think you're still in your honeymoon stage. You know, you just got married five minutes ago. And it's going to happen for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know everything happens for a reason and God has a plan for everyone. And when the time is right, Lamar and I will have a beautiful baby together. Next on <i>Keeping Up with the</i> <i>Kardashians:</i> KRIS: Where's my dress? BRUCE: Bitch, I want my damn ATM card. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are playing yourself right now. &gt;&gt; ROB: If I have to go to New York, I'll go to New York. If I look like an idiot... How much more stupid can I look? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you don't start helping me out, this relationship is done.
