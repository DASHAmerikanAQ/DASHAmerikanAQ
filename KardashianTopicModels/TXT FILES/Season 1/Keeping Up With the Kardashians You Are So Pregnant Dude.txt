- &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Previously on <i>Keeping Up With The</i> <i>Kardashians.</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney is dating a guy named Scott. He's really, really young... and I have serious doubts about Scott. &gt;&gt; Kourtney and Scott, stop making out! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're so in love, they're making out every two seconds. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are not at the age where you could get married to someone and have kids and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love her to death. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm watching you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Today I don't really feel well, so I'm going to get something to eat, like just a little snackaroo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I still feel nauseous. Remember I was nauseous, like, in New York every day? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here for a minute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You had a period lately? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not sure. I don't, like, write those things down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just saying. I've had a lot of friends that have, like, gotten pregnant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not pregnant. If I were pregnant, like, what would I... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Birth control was your protection? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. I always forget to take it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you forget to take it, it doesn't work. She's late and she's not sure and she doesn't think she's pregnant? Is she insane? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I'm sure I'm not. Don't you think I should just wait and see? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think the first thing we should do is take a test just to rule that out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is serious. I'm just so not ready to be a mom yet. So we go and get pregnancy tests. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know how to use this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I've never done this before. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, it's five days before a missed period. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, shall I just do it? I really don't understand, but... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Okay, wait, you have to pee on this nasty thing for five seconds, then lay it flat, like, on this table. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, then we'll die to see the answer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's die. Results in three minutes. KOURTNEY: How long has it been? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's only been like two minutes. Calm down. It's not that big of a deal. I know you're, like, so antsy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, what the ... does it even mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It says like one and a half? Like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That says you're pregnant! You're so pregnant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That two lines... It's one and a half. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Therefore, you're pregnant. It attempted to make a full line. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm, like, a little early. Anxiety attack at all seconds. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're like so high-strung, I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's call Scott and tell him to come over here and talk to me. He's going to freak the ... out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would be terrified to tell Scott. You're the one to call Scott over, Kris. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm calling him to come here, and then we can think of what to say in the meantime. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, look at these puppies! They're so cute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Does that look like Tito? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh... I think so. Maybe. One of them might be. Daddy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're the best daddy in the world. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can I get a puppy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You already have a dog. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, I don't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have Kabana. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, Kabana is the family dog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think so. I really don't. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why not? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm the one who's gonna wind up taking care of it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, you're not. I'll take care of her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm gonna clean up the poopies, I'm gonna clean up-- you know, feed it. I know you would love to have a dog, but... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Please, daddy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Absolutely no... more... dogs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, hey! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've no idea how Scott's gonna react about this. I just, I'm so nervous to even tell him. So, I took a little pregnancy test. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause she was nauseous and sleeping and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And Khloe convinced me that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I, like, forced her to take one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So... I took it, and it says I might be pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's a might somewhere? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's two lines. And if you're not pregnant, there's one line. But this test was blurry, and it was a line and a half. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I have no idea what you're talking about. I have no idea what that means in between. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have no idea. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I kind of wish you would have told me this by ourselves, but... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This whole pregnancy test thing is so confusing. I've got to find out whether I'm pregnant or not. This is gonna drive me insane. I'm gonna call um, a gyno and make an appointment. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, whatever it is, either way, I mean, we both know it's going to be fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks. I just want to find out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeller. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's so cute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He's huge now. I feel so bad, 'cause nobody's gonna buy him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall and Kylie have been dying to get another dog, but Bruce said, "Absolutely not." I guess they wouldn't mind going over to the pet shop and looking at the dog. Let's do this. Let's go on over there, and we're not gonna buy anything, okay? But let's just go take a look. Girls, look at all the puppies. Oh, my! Lookit! Kendall, these are cute. They're so cute. Something that every little girl wants is a little white, fluffy dog, and I'm thinking, "Oh, here we go." &gt;&gt; SHOP Assistant: This one's Stacy, and that one is Ernie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my gosh. I'm liking these dogs probably as much as the kids are falling in love. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mommy, get it, get it, please, please, please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, Daddy's gonna kill us if we come home with a dog. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, he won't. It'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's really cute. We can get the dog. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. We come home from Posh Puppy, and we're all really excited to get the dog into Kendall's room to get it all set up. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a little worried about Bruce's reaction to the dog, so I'm thinking maybe we should hide her for a little while until the heat's off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Going to the doctor to find out if I'm pregnant or not is such a weird feeling. Where do I go, right here? &gt;&gt; NURSE: Room two, yes. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Hi, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. I'm 28 years old. If it happens, it happens, and I'll take responsibility, but I don't feel like I'm ready at all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Today at 2:00, the car is picking us up and going to the chapel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're trying to say that you're getting married? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So... I'm not pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank God. Well, not "Thank God," but... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not pregnant. Thank God. Maybe someday, but not today. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go home and keep practicing not getting pregnant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How'd the doctor go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not preggers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you were wrong. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So what does that mean? That means we'll go to Vegas and get wasted? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wouldn't go to Vegas any other way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I heard that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, Kourtney's not pregnant? We all got to go to Vegas and par-tay. Whoo-hoo! You guys, let's go to Vegas and have a huge party. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not sure why we're going to Vegas, but I'll take any opportunity to go hang out with my girls. High five, everyone. Whoo! Get excited. &gt;&gt; Oh, my God. You've been drinking. &gt;&gt; She missed the couch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like to kind of have my closet handy because I might be in a sexy mood, I might be in a conservative mood. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're basically a psycho and you're full of mood swings. Mom, the party bus is here! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't bring any drinks, there's no bathroom. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: There's no bathroom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can't pee for five hours? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is my workout for the day, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Too much... ugh! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could somebody help me with this bag? &gt;&gt; KIM: Bring it, you're a grown woman. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you guys driving all the way? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, six hours. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, you guys out of here? Have fun. Come on, little girls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm hoping that Kendall can deal with the whole puppy situation while I'm in Vegas. And I'll deal with Bruce when I get back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good-bye, everybody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're gonna have to, like, pee on the side of the freakin' road. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have to pee, I have to pee, I have to pee, I have to pee. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm stuck on this bus with the urinator. All Kris wants to talk about is peeing. Stop talking about peeing and you won't need to pee! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall...! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Come on, come on, come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall... Kendall... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nothing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nothing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nothing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got that look on your face. Well, it's bed time. Go brush your teeth. Get ready for bed. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. Bella, don't make any noise. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I got to pee, I got to pee, I got to pee, I got to pee. Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, it's raining. It's raining. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going over here to pee outside. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so embarrassing! Somebody saw me! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so excited to be in Vegas. I got us hooked up this weekend for an amazing suite at the Palms. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go to your sky villa in fantasy tower. &gt;&gt; The fantasy suite. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Our suite is amazing. It is so pretty and big and there's a pool and everything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There you go, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: So if I'm, like, sitting here doing, like, a number two... Excuse me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is not even cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're gonna make it rain. What's up, everybody, it's Princess Kim Kardashian. I wanted to give a special shout out to my... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and Scott are all over each other, and I totally catch them sneaking out of the club early. These bitches better be smart and use a condom this time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I fell in love with you today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, that was fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you so much. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Would you hate if I asked you to marry me right now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Or tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you serious? I'm just, like, just totally shocked. I don't know if Scott's teasing me about getting married tomorrow or what. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not worried about where we're going, who we're telling or any of that sort of thing... okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Even though we drank tonight and had a nice dinner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I need to know that your heart is in it, not just your mind 'cause you're a little drunk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. Yes, I want to. I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am still drunk from last night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, you guys. Where's Scott and Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Probably still sleeping. They didn't wake up till, like, 4:00. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What part, dinner? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's why I got up early. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've never wanted to do anything more. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. He still wants to go through with it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why? Do you not? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I do. I love Scott. I guess, you know, why not now? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The sooner the better for me. <i>Hola.</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What happened to you last night? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We had a little... night in the Jacuzzi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ew! Now none of us can go in that Jacuzzi for the rest of the trip. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, guys... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Today at 2:00 the car's picking us up and going to the chapel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What, are you joking? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're trying to say that you're getting married? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're in Vegas, dolls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They want to get married today. I am totally devastated. No, Kourtney, come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I come? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys don't want to get married... &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Is it just you or all of us? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She wants to get married today. I'm shocked. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, we haven't even had an engagement party yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: If Kourtney wants to get married today, Kourtney's getting married today. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just feel really weird about this whole thing. She's rushing this a little bit. &gt;&gt; KIM: I understand the whole Vegas thing, 'cause I did it, but I was 19. She's 28. When you were 28, you had four kids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the same wedding chapel that Brittney Spears got married in. Now we know that Kourtney and Scott are going to last forever. &gt;&gt; Tell me what time do you want to get married? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now. &gt;&gt; So what will happen is, when you walk in, the best man and maid of honor will come in first. &gt;&gt; Your hand will come up here like that and you'll place the ring on her finger. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It feels really rushed, but I guess I'm about to get married. &gt;&gt; After you kiss her, I'll introduce you, you know, Mr. and Mrs. And then as you walk hand in hand down the aisle, back down the aisle like this, and you'll be very happy-- you'll smile. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel really bad about this wedding and how everything is happening so fast. And I don't know whether or not I should stop it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, I cannot believe you're going to get married. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you getting excited or nervous? What do you feel like? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. It feels like... I could open my mouth and throw up. I just feel like we woke up and just haven't really had a second to think about this. I can't believe we're really getting married. We just haven't even talked about it really. &gt;&gt; You look good, man. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I have no idea what I'm wearing at this point, but I'm trying for the best. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, I don't know what to do, and this isn't how I see my daughter getting married. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just stop it. You're her mother. Tell her no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's... okay, she's 28 years old. How do you tell a 28-year-old to stop it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just say stop, don't do this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We cannot have a wedding without you and Kendall and Kylie. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If you stop it, you've got my support. She just can't do it this way. Tell her no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This feels wrong. Bruce isn't here. Your little sisters aren't here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, can I talk to you for a sec? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look really pretty, but this is wrong. You've got hot pink flowers and you're standing under plastic roses. Now I know you. It's not about the things, I don't mean to make it about that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But this feels wrong. You're rushing it. Bruce isn't here. Your little sisters aren't here. They would die if they thought they weren't your bridesmaids. Where are his parents? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's his family, you know? This is about family. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think maybe my mom's right. This feels so rushed and just not right. I never really thought about what my wedding would be, but this is certainly not it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, am I supposed to see you before the ceremony? &gt;&gt; You guys aren't supposed to see each other. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just wanted to tell you... Um... I don't know... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This doesn't sound good already. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I was just talking to my mom, and I just feel like we should do this, like, the right way. When we got here, I was just like more and more nervous. My grandma's like, not here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I love her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And Kendall and Kylie. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We love each other like, really. And I love you more than anything. I want to be able to remember the wedding for the rest of my life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You agree. 'Cause that would not be good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got too much lip balm on. Okay, go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I guess Scott and I will just keep living in sin. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Come here. Bella. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall? What is that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My friend's dog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wait, wait, wait, wait, come here, come here, come here. Whose dog is that? No lying. What's the deal? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Uh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's your dog. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Maybe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: After I said no? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mommy let me get her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can barely hear you. How's things going in Vegas? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just stopped a wedding. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You stopped the wedding? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a bad connection. Can I call you back? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I just went into Kendall's room and there's a dog in there. I told you how many times? &gt;&gt; KRIS: At least I stopped the wedding. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You stopped the wedding, but now the problem is... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can we talk about it when I get home? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...I've got this dog in the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would like to make a toast, everybody. To, um, a really crazy day. It definitely was an experience. Guys, take your time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We wanted to know if we had your blessing on waiting about the premarital sex. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tonight's the night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ride him like you've never ridden a horse before. &gt;&gt; Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, good advice. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're the one who paid for those horseback riding lessons. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're having so much fun. We did a couple too many shots. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, no, what are you going to do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe loves it. She loves it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Girls Gone Wild. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have to keep it down. You're holding up the entire... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get off of me! This is so embarrassing. No! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Oh, my God, no one got married! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one got married. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I thought you would be my son-in-law by now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We couldn't do it without you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall? Oh, man. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm waxing your chest. &gt;&gt; I don't want to do this. &gt;&gt; Assistance. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Never seen a homeless man in Calabasas. Come with me in my car. Can I get you some scrubbies? &gt;&gt; Open your mouth wide. Good. &gt;&gt; My parents are going to think we're insane. Hi, Bruce.
