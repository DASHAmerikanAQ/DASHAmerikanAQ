- &gt;&gt; KIM: I... am... starving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you have a photo shoot tomorrow? Stop eating. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's, like, got the jiggles. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, she's always had an ass. Where did this come from? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well,, a little cardio. &gt;&gt; KIM: I hear you talking about me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so, like, catty of you. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She said you have a lot of junk in your trunk. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I meant outside in your car. There's some stuff in your car we need to get out. &gt;&gt; KIM: I hate you all. Welcome to my family. &gt;&gt; Kim, Kim, right here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The princess is in the building. I'm Khloe. My sisters say I'm a bitch. Who thecares? Shut up, everyone. But I always have their best interests at heart. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm Kourtney. I'm the oldest and the most mature. I really think you should tighten your bikini top 'cause yourlook really saggy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm Kris Jenner. Because I'm the mom. I'm the mom and Kim's manager. Okay, Kim, it's your world. I just live in it. Say what you want, but I know what's best for my kids... and my husband. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm Bruce Jenner, and I am a pushover for my family... Kendall, sit down! ...up to a point. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then Bruce and I together have Kendall and Kylie Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My little Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're gonna have two cocktails on the rocks. Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You shouldn't be on the pole. &gt;&gt; Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: So it's six kids and two crazy parents. We're the modern-day Brady Bunch with a kick. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, hey, hey, hey! &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wish I was adopted! You're so evil. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's a lot of baggage that comes with us. But it's like Louis Vuitton baggage; you always want it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get off of me, fatty! &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; So what do you have planned for today? Getting ready for the party? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce and I have been married for 16 years, so we decided to have a little get-together tomorrow at the house and celebrate our anniversary. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who's coming to the party? &gt;&gt; The Cranes and the Cokers and the Miles. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is anybody gonna ask me who I invited? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have any friends besides my mom's friends? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. There's no way to tone down anything with my mom. She wants a huge party and Bruce would probably rather just do nothing or golf. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who'd you invite, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nobody. The only friends I have is my family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Those are the best kind of friends. We'll never screw you over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim, what are you doing? So I just got a call from Tyra Banks' people, and they want you to go on <i>The Tyra Banks</i> <i>Show.</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: They want me to go on <i>Tyra?</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tyra Banks has asked me to be her show next week, and I'm so excited. Oh, my gosh, that's so cool. I love Tyra. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. How cool would that be? There's just one little catch. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You'd have to talk about the tape. One of the things that Tyra's gonna want to talk about is the sex tape. When I first heard about Kim's tape, as her mother, I wanted to kill her, but as her manager, I knew that I had a job to do, and I really just wanted her to move past it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to talk about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but you could just, you know, be honest and say how you feel, and... &gt;&gt; KIM: Kind of just set the record straight? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you could do that. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was with my boyfriend of three years that I was very much in love with, and whatever we did in our private time was our private time, and never once did we think that it would get out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going to be Tyra, and you're going to be Kim Kardashian. So, what do you do for a living? Tell me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I own a clothing store, and I'm a wardrobe stylist. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why did you make a sex tape? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because I was horny, and I felt like it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna get the butterfish. Thanks. &gt;&gt; TJ: If you have any questions or need anything, my name's TJ. Just let me know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. I'm Scott and that's Kourtney. &gt;&gt; TJ: Nice to meet you, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait! Cheers. You don't even say cheers. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh! I forgot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My boyfriend's name is Scott. We were friends for about a year and then started dating and been together ever since. Can I have my phone? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's see if anybody even contacted you. You have no missed calls, nothing, so what could it really...? Want to know the time? 9:30. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that's not what I'm looking for. No, I want my phone back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For what? You always give me when I talk on my phone at dinner. Do you need to contact your wireless server for some reason? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're obviously in a really annoying mood. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that right? At least your hair looks nice... with your $5,000 extensions. &gt;&gt; TJ: Your chocolate soufflé will be right up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We'll just have the check. &gt;&gt; TJ: Okay, I'll be right back with that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I run Dash with my sisters. It is a high fashion women's boutique. It's a place that we all go and get to catch up and relax and just gossip with one another. Honestly, I could not see Scott ever doing that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, I have never seen him act this way. He was, like, crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wish I was there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When you wrote me, "What sign is he?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but then I figured it out. And I was, like, "Oh, my God, Gemini; twin personalities." They'repsycho, dude. I used to date a Gemini. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Freak show. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, look who comes to town. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, will you come outside with me for a sec? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You won't kiss me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, you're gonna be nice today? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why wouldn't I be? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was so shocked at how you acted. Like, it was just so not like you. You've never acted like that before, and I don't even know where it came from. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have serious doubts about Scott because I found out he's cheating on Kourtney. And as her mom, I want to tell her, but I don't know how. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Precious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love how quickly you two can make up. Love is the weirdest thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know what, Khloe? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: When it comes to breakups, it ain't happening here. &gt;&gt; What do you got going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Anniversary at the house today. &gt;&gt; With your wife? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 16 years. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You want to know the life of a male when you have little girls, what it is? These little girls, they just love their daddy, everything is great, and then they hit about 12. But then you know what happens? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your wife hits menopause. See? That's the life of a male right there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; Hi, how are ya? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Fine. How are you? &gt;&gt; I'm good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm having an anniversary party tonight, and we wanted to get some wine. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have something we can taste? &gt;&gt; I do. I have two whites and two reds. You can try them both and see what you like. This is a Tangent Viognier. Viognier is the grape. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. I'm not loving this one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. It tastes soapy. Do you have any tequila? &gt;&gt; We do. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your hair looks good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got a little... I went to the chop shop. How you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, Mom, Kourtney and Kim are not here. And if someone could find Mom... I've been trying to call them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one's answering. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think I've ever had whiskey. Good. Can I just have a little bit more? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One thing's leading to another... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa. ...and sure enough, we find ourselves tasting about six or seven different kinds of liquor. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Happy love day. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So the party's already started and Kourtney and my mom are nowhere to be found. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe's gonna kill us. All right. Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where you guys been? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's about time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How many people are here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you drunk? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Her and Kourtney are wasted. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're just... came to fix the party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fix the party? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you know, fix things for the party. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're gonna go cheer... cheer everyone on and say hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look so cute, though. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, hold my little hand. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get it, honey! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get it, shorty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cutie pie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm gonna go take care of 'em. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whose voice do I hear? &gt;&gt; KIM: The princess is in the building. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, nice dress, Kim. That dress is amazing. I saw it once, and I think I asked for it back a couple months ago. If anything happens to my dress, I'm literally gonna strangle her and beat her with a bat. &gt;&gt; ♫ Let's get this party started... ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I'm talking to Robin Antin-- she created the Pussycat Dolls. So I have to show her the gift I got for Mom and Bruce, a stripper pole. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Ready, dip, six, and dip. Yeah. Shake, shake, shake. Bite. Down and up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Perfect. Oh, my God, I'm ripping this dress. Khloe's gonna kill me. &gt;&gt; Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, guys! Look what I can do. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Kid, you are a future Pussycat Doll, let me tell you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let me see that. Oh... Oh, my God! How did you learn how to do that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, what's going on in here? &gt;&gt;: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, I just don't think that's appropriate. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it's not funny. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Oh, it's fantastic. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, Daddy, stop! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. We're out of here! Come on, let's go! Whoo! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye! Bye! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and Scott, stop making out! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't hate. &gt;&gt; It's cute; don't hate. &gt;&gt; KIM: People, people. We're here to celebrate the lovely matrimony of Kris and Bruce Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would just like to say thank you for some of our old friends and some of our new friends, uh, coming out here today. I've been very blessed for the last 16 years, and I love you to death and I love our family, so let's make it another 16. &gt;&gt; OTHERS: Aw...! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris and I met, uh, on a blind date. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had just gone through a divorce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love at first sight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We were married five months later. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That is our wedding day. Back then, 16 years ago. There's Robert right there. That is the day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks, guys. &gt;&gt; Kris! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello, my turn. I would just like to say, thank God you had a vasectomy a couple years ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, what do you think about the difference in your ages? 'Cause I know that you're a little bit... younger than Kourtney. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's the appeal. Are you trying to push me on to Kylie or Kendall? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that what you're doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop. I don't know, I think it's the perfect time to confront Scott about Kourtney. What I'm saying is, Kourtney's probably at the age where she might be looking for something a little bit more serious. You are not at the age where you could potentially get married to someone and have kids and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love her to death. Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no! No, stop it, stop it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going out to New York to be on the <i>Tyra Banks Show.</i> I wish I had more time. I'm, like, freaking out. &gt;&gt; Kim, if we can start walking, we're gonna mike you downstairs, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney is dating a guy named Scott. To me, he's really, really young, and I just don't see somebody his age settling down into that kind of a life right now. I don't feel like at his age... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And he's not 22, he's 24. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, 24. Okay, 24-- do you think he's ready for a monogamous relationship? But I just think that if she thought that Scott would cheat on her, that she would be really upset. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think Scott cheats on me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris, how can you even say that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And if he did, that's between him and I. It's not an appropriate time to be questioning my boyfriend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm watching you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is your issue with me and Kourt? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Being a part of this family isn't easy, I admit it. I want the best for Kourtney. The person that comes into our family has to be someone who has a great character. We've seen a lot of guys come and go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I hope you have your eyes on me, 'cause I will never do anything to disrespect your daughter, ever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw. Oh, sugary smooth. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Honest, so she wouldn't... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm watching you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really don't want to talk about it anymore. I feel like the more I talk about it, the more it just, you know, gets brought up... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you gonna talk at all about the tape? I'm really scared for Kim to do the Tyra show, because her very first TV interview, she's gonna have to talk about the sex tape openly. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know, I mean, I'll just totally be honest. I'm so nervous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, don't be nervous, Kimmy! &gt;&gt; BOTH: Bartenders serving! &gt;&gt; Very nice. &gt;&gt; Margarita, please. &gt;&gt; Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Good. All right, shake. Lift, lift, lift. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, my turn. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; Shake, shake, shake. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't really think it's appropriate that you're behind a bar... while we're having a party. My little girls making martinis? I'm thinking, maybe this isn't really happening. I think this party is over. Thanks. Come back again soon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hope you had a good anniversary. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had a great anniversary. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm glad you and Bruce are still making out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney is so mad at me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What did you say? You said, "I don't think you're 24 years old"? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I said, "I think you're a little young for Kourtney if... You know, that you're too young to, to..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's none of your business. And I don't think that's appropriate of you to say that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously, you really, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Need to stay out of people's personal lives. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But in this family, that's not how it rolls. We make it our business to know what's going on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know Mom is hiding something from us, and I am going to get to the bottom of it. What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not sure if I should tell you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Spit it out. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Cece's daughter... &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, Cece's what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Cece's friend's daughter was seeing Scott. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, yeah. Cece was going to tell Kourtney, but then all of you guys went to Miami. And we didn't want to ruin the trip. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're trying to tell me that you got a phone call from Cece about Scott and you didn't tell Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KIM: I really can't believe my mom hasn't told any of us. And when Kourtney finds out, she's going to go crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm in New York to be on <i>The Tyra Banks Show.</i> I'm bringing my best friend Brittny Gastineau with me for support. I love this dress. This is what I wear all the time, so I want to give it to her. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Did she say that she wanted it? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I just... I don't... I want to fill up the segment so she doesn't ask me, like.... questions that I don't want to answer. &gt;&gt; BRITNNY: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: About the tape and stuff. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: It'll go by so fast. I like this the best. I think you look, like, so chic. &gt;&gt; KIM: That doesn't look right. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: It's a daytime talk show. This is like, perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, that's not going to look right. I think I should stay at the hotel. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Here, you zip, I hold. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like stuck. Like, I feel good in this one, but I also don't want to be super boring. Should I just bring my whole bag? &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: The whole suitcase? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have no choice. I'm just getting really nervous. You know, it's my first interview with a live audience on camera, so I don't want to be nervous and say the wrong things. I just want it to be perfect. Does Tyra come out and, like, meet you before you go out? &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Um, I don't think so. &gt;&gt; KIM: I so badly just want <i>Tyra Banks</i> to be over. I want to just snap my fingers and have already done the interview. &gt;&gt; Five minutes please, folks. Five minutes till we walk. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I got to cut this tag out. I wish I had more time. I'm, like, freaking out that I'm not going to be ready. &gt;&gt; Kim, if we can start walking. We're going to mike you downstairs, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: I wish my sisters were here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Will you come outside? I just want to talk to you for a couple minutes. This is going to be really hard to do, but Kourtney has the right to know that Scott's been cheating on her. And since I'm the one with the bad news, I feel like I should be the one to tell her. I just didn't want to talk to you inside in front of your brother, because I didn't want you to be embarrassed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I thought about telling you this for a really long time, so I don't want you to be upset or be, you know, sad about it or anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Spit it out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was talking to Cece because a friend of hers dated Scott, you know, a couple months ago. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Duh. I know all about it. You don't know the time frame. We weren't even together. I know exactly what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You knew about this the whole time? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We were not exclusive to each other. This is like way old news. I know all about it. My boyfriend and I communicate, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel so much better about Scott. And I feel so embarrassed that I came down so hard on him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should just talk to him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He doesn't have to explain it to me. He doesn't owe me an explanation. I just owe him an apology. He probably thinks what a freak I am. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's for sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me a hug. I love you. &gt;&gt; That was good. &gt;&gt; KIM: How did I look on camera? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was so nervous, I'm like sweating in this. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Really? I'm freezing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. It's like freezing, but I'm excited. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm done with my Tyra interview. And the only thing I think will make me feel better is shopping. &gt;&gt; 42 carats. $1.2 million. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not so bad. Cha-ching. Would it be pathetic if I bought this for myself? Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim. What happened on <i>Tyra?</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: She's so nice. She's great. She was making me feel very comfortable. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim actually does a really good job under pressure. &gt;&gt; KIM: She was wanting to talk about, you know, the sex tape, and she was just trying to ask the questions that I think other people would want to know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, I'm not going to drag it on and let people be reminded of a negative thing that happened in my life when I don't have to. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I agree. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hopefully, I'll replace it with a lot of positive things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You should have said, "Hey, Tyra, wait till you see Bruce's sex tape." Group hug. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get youroff of me. You're such a whore. &gt;&gt; This season on <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>With the Kardashians--</i> &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, there is a whore watching your children. Kim, there is a spider on you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: That's so embarrassing. Why am I getting arrested? &gt;&gt; What the hell are you doing?! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going to do <i>Playboy.</i> &gt;&gt; That's very nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey... Jeff wants you girls to be the spokespersons for his new bikini line. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does Bruce know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, hi, guys. Why do you guys lie to me like this all the time? &gt;&gt; KIM: I swear to God I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everything's about you! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to ditch the bitch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so pregnant, dude. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Dolce and I can handle everything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want you to be with me forever. Will you marry me, doll? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's trying to suck up to me. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you could handle us, I swear to God, it's like the best accomplishment. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This time we went straight to the FBI. &gt;&gt; KIM: But it's my fault, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why was the FBI here?
