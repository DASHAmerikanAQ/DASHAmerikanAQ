- &gt;&gt; KIM: My career is super busy. I was so nervous! A photo shoot or doing a movie or a TV show and sometimes I'm doing it all in one day. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how beautiful your body looks if you don't get the face right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't want to be called a "butta" face. Everything is good "but her face." &gt;&gt; KIM: So tonight my mom booked me to walk in this fashion show and I'm really excited. This is gonna be a great night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hear the pitter-patter of a dinosaur. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, party's here. We can start now. Kim doesn't drink, so we always have to bring our own wine. Hi, girls, how are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, I think you should do your hair kind of like... kind of like a poshish. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every time we go anywhere, it's like, I've got the wrong dress on, I don't have the right hair cut. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom is my manager and I love her to death. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I've got to have a drink. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I feel like she's a little bit overwhelming sometimes. Thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, let's roll. Come on. &gt;&gt; Okay, I need to check IDs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why do we need IDs? They're in the show. &gt;&gt; They're in the show. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can we just go down? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is nonsense. &gt;&gt; KIM: This show is so unorganized, so chaotic. No one knows what they're doing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. This is all for charity. And enjoy the show. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot believe my mom booked me for this. This is the worst show ever. &gt;&gt; Ow! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How much does this suck? Oh, my God, Kourtney is paging me. She says, I'm starving and this blows, so we should go eat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm starving, the only people that are not starving are theplus-sized models and I'm pissed. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to look unprofessional, but I actually ran out and ditched the end of the show. No one even knew. The question is, who is my manager? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did, this is not my fault. I had no control over this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who sets up, who schedules me, who is my manager? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. I had no control. I'm out of here. Mom, that was so embarrasing. You should be embarrassed to say that you're her manager. I would be. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, this isn't my fault. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Please don't ever invite me to places like this again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had no control over what they're modeling and who shows up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, who set this up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what? You live and you learn. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you've been saying you live and you learn for like the last ten events you've made me go to. I get really frustrated because my mom wants to book me for everything that just comes our way. I need her to really pay attention and to focus on what's going on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall said she did not kick you first. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes, she did. I was going like this... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...and then she kicked me and she's all like, stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, well, she told me that she lightly kicked you and that you waited 20 minutes and then you randomly pushed her in the kitchen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're both wrong and if I see it happen again. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, guys, I have a photo shoot to go to. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Peace. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, bye, Mom. I'll see you later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you're supposed to be there by 9:30. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you talking about? I have to be there at 11:00. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Deena Katz set up the audition for the movie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Deena Katz, Mom? I have my photo shoot today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, we already confirmed the audition... &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you just asked me if I wanted to do it. You never gave me a confirmation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, yes, we did. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you told me two things on the same date, I would know... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: That I couldn't be at one place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is really, this makes us both look bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've gotta go. I'm gonna be late and then I'll get blamed for that when that's not my fault either. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Kim, it's your world, I just live in it. I can't believe her. I just, I really don't think she knows what it takes, you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Would you like my opinion? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You would? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Depends on what it is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You guys, if you're gonna continue to work together, you just have to get better coordinated. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I consider myself a pretty hands-on manager, being that my two clients are my daughter and my husband. You are very easy to book because you do your speeches, you're in, you're out, you've been doing it for 20 years and it's done. With her, it's new. I think I'm really organized, but I have a lot of balls in the air at all times. So it definitely gets a little difficult. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's all, just gotta be better coordinated... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, I gotta go to work. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have a good day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, girls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're gonna take the dog to the vet and do all that stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. My life really revolves around my family. All right, the laundry is in! I mean, I've got a big enough family that that covers my day, you know 24/7. Uh, Dolce not feeling very well last night. Seems to be doing better today. &gt;&gt; Might not feel good. Okay stay right there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Aw, stay. Now speaking of that, Kris was wondering about his little private parts down here, how they keep sticking out all the time. &gt;&gt; You'll have to flip it back in. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What do you mean by stick it back in? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stick it back in? Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; You need to work around it, flip the skin over. You don't have to do it, that's a dad job. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We watched the doctor do it, I think that was good enough. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's okay, Dolce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, Dolce, you're gonna be okay. Good seeing you. &gt;&gt; See you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go guys, we're out of here. Which one of you two now that you know how to stick it back in? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, you know what you ought to do is try to teach Kim how to do it. She's good with that stuff. &gt;&gt; Oh, my God, look how cute this is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wanna take one of everything for Kendall and Kylie. &gt;&gt; If you plan to pay for it. Otherwise, don't even think about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm busy 24/7. Thank you so much. I own a store with Kourtney called Smooch, which is a few doors down from the girl's store Dash. And then there's managing Kim and Bruce, and then there's my family. Ow! Thank God for Bruce. I couldn't do it all and take care of the little girls without him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nails! All right, can you take on three of us? Uh, what I go through. I personally don't think that there's not too many people can handle all this stuff. So what color are you going with? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hot pink. Can I get a flower, Dad? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One second, let me get this phone out. It's probably my next assignment. Hello? Hi, babe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was just wondering, do you think that you could get the girls their school supplies? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got it. Bye. How do those toes look, Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You can have matching with me, pink with black diamonds. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Be-yotch, yeah, big booty hoes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so annoyed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You seem like you have a stick shoved up your ass. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I don't, I have Mom strangling me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tell me all about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What did she do to you? &gt;&gt; KIM: She books me on an audition and a photo shoot for the cover of a magazine on the same day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She doesn't even call you to remind you, like when you have... &gt;&gt; KIM: She called me the night before and reminded me for my photo shoot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Then you need to ditch the bitch. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel really bad because I kind of like yelled at her this morning when I walked out the door. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You wouldn't feel bad if it wasn't your mom, if it was just a normal manager, you wouldn't feel bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need to get a professional manager. There's no harm in meeting with someone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: See how the vibe goes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, Kylie, Kylie, Kylie, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She hit me first! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie! Hi, babe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Driving back from the beach. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys have fun? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, they all had a good time. I've been running around with kids all day. I'm going to go to the club and hit some balls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, who's going to watch the kids? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Um, you, you're coming home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, we don't close the store until 6:00. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come home soon as you can. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, bye, sweetie. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce loves to play golf, and when he's with the girls all day, he can't play golf on his days off. So I want to do something really nice for him. Kourtney, I have to go home early today. I'm thinking about calling this agency that I've used for a bazillion years and seeing if they can send someone over to baby-sit a couple days a week, help with dinner, do some errands, and drive the kids around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so tired. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, me, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what I've been thinking? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really, really, really, want to hire a nanny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, you got me. What do you need a nanny for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have somebody. I just want to give it a trial &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tomorrow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Does that mean I can play golf all day? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, somebody's got to train her-- you can't just, like, have somebody show up and nobody telling her what to do, and I have to work tomorrow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey. All right! &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: You want to be an actress, is that what you want? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: That's what I'm saying. What's your ultimate goal? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm totally open to the idea of hiring someone else, so I've set up some meetings and I think that it's safe, because my mom was supposed to be at the store all day. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You got to prioritize things. You got to basically figure out where you want to be in five years. I have an e-mail that says Tisdale at Managing ... Concepts and you know that's M.A.C. Management, so when I communicate... If I send somebody something... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I came to clean up a little bit before I go back to the office. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, I'm Kris. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hey, Kris, how are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Fine. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Robert Tisdale, very nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Robert, nice to meet you. Can I get you guys anything to drink? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, we got it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I mean, I feel bad, I really do, but if I had a different manager, they would have a whole staff of people. They would just be a little bit more professional. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Okay, bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, doll. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cleaning up the store. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just met with the managers at Mom's house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How was it? &gt;&gt; KIM: It was kind of weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At Mom's house? Did you tell her that you were meeting with them? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So how was the meetings? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, everyone definitely had good advice and good points. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know if you want to fire her yet? &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like no one else will take care of me the way she will, you know, she has my best interests, but she needs some kind of shock. So I've devised a plan. Mom! I'm gonna send Khloe in to have a talk with my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; KIM: To wake her up a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like I should tell you that I think you're about to be fired. &gt;&gt; KRIS: By Kim? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, Kim is just not happy with how you're hand, like, how you're working with her and how you're over-booking her. She's serious about it, 'cause she's already looked into other managers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who has she met with? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know she's met with Frankie, I think she met with Johnny Riot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what? I work my ass off for Kim and for everybody else. I try to do everything I can to make everybody happy. If Kim doesn't want me to be her manager, then I'm no longer Kim's manager. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, don't tell her I told you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's fine Hi, you've reached the office of Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian's former manager. If you'd like to get a hold of... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...my ungrateful daughter, you can call her on her personal and private cell phone which is 818-222- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, myGod. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you have any questions whatsoever... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't leave the phone number. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give Kim a shout. I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She didn't fire you yet. Like, why are you just jumping to conclusions? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's okay. I am not gonna be around when I'm not wanted, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you joking? You cannot leave. This is your store. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what? You figure it out. I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you punishing me for Kimberly? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye! Toodles! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, there is a whore watching your children. You need to get over here before your husband leaves you for this 12-year old be-yotch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you jumping to conclusions? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am not gonna be around when I'm not wanted, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you cannot leave me here. I don't know how to run this store! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye! Toodles! &gt;&gt; Hi, this is Jonathan calling with Sony. Looking for Kris Jenner. Um... I'll try the other number. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRIE: I'm Brie, the nanny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're Brie the nanny. Nice to see you. This is Brie, came to help out. Kylie, Kendall. Are you good with homework? &gt;&gt; BRIE: Yeah, definitely. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, really. That's important. &gt;&gt; BRIE: They need some help with their homework? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, they always need help with their homework. &gt;&gt; BRIE: But Dad, it's a Friday, we're supposed to have fun today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, make yourself comfortable. &gt;&gt; BRIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If Kim wants to fire me, then fine, I'm treating myself to an entire day at the spa. Everyone else can take care of themselves. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. Can you please call my mother who is my manager? Hello? Is it possible to call my manager? She has my schedule. Um, no, this isn't. Can I give you her number? &gt;&gt; Feels good? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm.. &gt;&gt; I will give you good massage now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Go, up, up, up. I'm not ready, I'm not ready. Don't squeeze my neck. You have to squeeze my leg then. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ready, set, go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, it's Kris, leave your name and number and I'll call you back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, honey, where are you? You've got to call me back. &gt;&gt; You're not cold? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; Do you feel good? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Man, if Kris could see this. Nice idea to get a nanny, but it's just really starting to bother me now. &gt;&gt; BRIE: Whoa, look at this closet. Oh, man. How does this go on? Looks good. What do you think of this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls, get to your homework! I'd like to fire this nanny right now, but you know what, I think it's time I taught my wife a lesson. That you can't do everything in life. &gt;&gt; BRIE: Right, reading time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She really missed the boat. She didn't check this out at all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, the diva came late again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Guess what we've been doing. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; TOGETHER: Answering your phone calls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I just think it's rude that Mom, would first of all, not... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just drop you like that? And now she's not even answering the phones, like, she's not even going to take on her responsibility. &gt;&gt; KIM: I haven't talked to her all day, what do I do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, why don't you give Khloe and I each 5% and we'll be your manager. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your boobs look good, they don't look so gigantic. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, I'm not wearing a bra. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Please stop molesting my sister. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, Khloe-Moey, this is Brie. &gt;&gt; BRIE: Hi, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mom sent her over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you guys go swimming or something? Is that why you're wearing a bikini? &gt;&gt; BRIE: Yeah, we went swimming today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I tell you what, Brie, why don't you take the girls into the other room. &gt;&gt; BRIE: All right, come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, she's wearing a bra top in front of you? I think that's so inappropriate. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You think it's inappropriate? I've been here all day long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Should I fire her? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, mother hired her, mother fires her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is mom? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom supposedly called a really reputable agency, but it looks like to me she called Hookers R Us. This girl is Trash-y. It's the voicemail. Mom, there is a whore watching your children, basically topless, around your husband. You need to get over here before your husband leaves you for this 12-year-old be-yotch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where have you been all day? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just running around. How are you? What's going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's going on? This is Brie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRIE: I'm the nanny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRIE: Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How did it go today? &gt;&gt; BRIE: Oh, it's been great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She took your place for the day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, she took your place for the day. &gt;&gt; BRIE: And of course your husband, he's been a big help to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, that's my husband, always a big help. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I'm a big help, that's me. I am Mr. Help. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you go put a little cover up on and I want to talk to my husband for a second, okay? Thanks. &gt;&gt; BRIE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why didn't you just tell her to leave when you saw her? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Because you hired her to be here, plus I wanted you to meet her, I thought she was just pretty funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why didn't you call me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I called you five times, you never answered your phone, so, you know, get over it. And you hired her, you fire her. Okay, good-bye. &gt;&gt; BRIE: I'm going to put on a shirt right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't need those babies out all the time. You're still going to look like you've got big knockers no matter what. &gt;&gt; BRIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Listen, this is just not going to work out. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I just think it's not working out for me. &gt;&gt; BRIE: Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was a nice gesture, I don't need any help, it's over, it's done, I can handle everything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're the best dad. I love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God, now she's trying to suck up to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every day I run my business, manage two careers and look after my family. It just gets so insane trying to keep everything on track. Has anybody even eaten? It's hard to admit but I guess some things are falling through the cracks. Maybe that's what's been happening with Kim. I really need to talk to her and make it right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, stop crying, it's not that serious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Body slam! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just kind of chilling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hard day at work? Let me see how many calls I've gotten today. 47 calls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, I'm never going to be perfect. I'm going to make mistakes. But I need you to trust me and trust that I'm just trying to do the best that I can do. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sorry if I've been mean, and you know, kind of used Khloe to kind of fake fire you. It was all just to kind of upset you, which worked, but I think it, I was never expecting you to, you know, give out my number and have me handle everything, and I clearly can't. So I realize what a good job you're doing, but I think that you might need some help. Mom, stop crying. It's not that serious. We were kidding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not a joke to me because I'm very serious about, you know, how I handle your business and how I handle the business of our whole family. All I need you to realize is that I do have your best interest at heart and that I'm trying as hard as I can to keep it all going on. Khloe! &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you freaks doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you guys are humping each other again, I'm embarrassed for you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, hey, hey. I've got some boxing gloves. You guys want me to get some boxing gloves on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's better raw. Real deal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Somebody is going to bust a finger. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tai Bo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fistfight. &gt;&gt; KIM: No they're fistfight. They're crazy. Anyway, I'm really sorry. I just want to work it out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls. You don't need to be doing this. &gt;&gt; KIM: We'll have to come up with a system, maybe like a schedule or... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Body slam! &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you and I don't want anyone else as a manager but you. &gt;&gt; KHRIS: That makes me feel good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can we change the machine now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll think about it. &gt;&gt; Next time on <i>Keeping Up With</i> <i>The Kardashians.</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: Frances called and wants you to do a new bikini line. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does Bruce know? &gt;&gt; KIM: His heart can't take it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're doing what? &gt;&gt; <i>Girls Gone Wild.</i> &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? Bro, you're in charge. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. Well, hi guys. Why don't you tell me what's going on?
