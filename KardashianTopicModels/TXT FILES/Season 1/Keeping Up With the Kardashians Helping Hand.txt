Who are you dating? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm not dating anyone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why, are you trying to go on a date with him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm just trying... He's always at school, and I never get to talk to him. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I have been in a little of a... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's in a little bit of a drought. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: A drought? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't we go to like a little burlesque show or a gentlemen's club and meet a nice girl? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm always down to go to the club. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you ever been to a strip club? &gt;&gt; KIM: They're sick. My brother is not dating a stripper, that's sick. I'm going to find him a nice, normal girl. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You don't bone the strippers. You get to <i>know</i> the strippers. &gt;&gt; KIM: Exactly, you get to know them inside and out. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm open to anything. Gin! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's noway you just won. No way. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I really want to find Rob a girlfriend. &gt;&gt; STEPHEN MOLESKI: What kind of girl do you want to set him up with? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just like a nice girl. Who can we set him up with? Do you know anyone? &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: Actually, I have a, my best friend, like, she's so sweet. I think you've met her once before. You know her-- Kara Monaco. &gt;&gt; KIM: What does she look like? &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: She was Playmate of the Year, actually, last year. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, no way. &gt;&gt; KARA: Hello? &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: Hey, Kara, it's Stephen. I'm calling from Kim's phone. She wants to set you up with her brother. &gt;&gt; KIM: My brother is really cool and really polite. &gt;&gt; KARA: I love it. &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: You'll have fun. He's actually really cute. &gt;&gt; KARA: That's a good thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to scare you but, like, it's not just dating my brother, you're like dating the whole family. &gt;&gt; KARA: Awesome. &gt;&gt; KIM: You'll love it. I hope. &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That homeless man, he was here the other day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? That's kind of random. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is Calabasas, why is he here? This is like really bad for business. I have never seen a homeless man in Calabasas. None of my customers are going to want to walk by this guy to come into our store. I saw him here the other day and now he's here again. I mean, I just hope he's not going to start hanging out over here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hanging out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like hanging out in the center, that's like creepy. You look so cute in that little sweater. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing tonight? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I got a date. She's a Playmate. &gt;&gt; Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Looks like you're going on the golf course. Change your shirt. Your jeans and shoes are perf. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, wait, Roberto, this is from the '80s. This is not cool anymore. I'm waxing your chest. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You only can do a little piece though, not the whole thing. If it hurts too bad, I'm not doing it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to show you how it's going to feel. I get my vagina waxed. It doesn't hurt. Move. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Oh, my gosh, this is... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One, two, three. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Ow! &gt;&gt; KIM: Not right in his throat! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What'd you hit him in his jugular for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need you up on the counter, please. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Oh, yeah, you wax your own, right, Kourt? Wait, wait, wait, wait... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Silence. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hurry, take it off! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No way, no. No, no, no... Ow, Kourtney! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You just pulled his nipple off! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I don't want to do this. Bruce, help me! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing to this poor guy? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I don't want this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One, two, three. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What the! No more, no more, no more. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. What are we wearing? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You guys aren't coming with me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, we are the people that approve or deny. Are you joking? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: So I'm going to go brush my teeth and go, and you guys aren't coming. There's no way that I'm going to let my sisters go on this date with me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just make sure you wrap it up, angel. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Ow! &gt;&gt; Stop it! &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you sure we should do this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, what do you mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you joking? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just kind of feel bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a date, it's not like we're walking in on him having sex. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, let's just go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Vamanos. Vamanos! &gt;&gt; KARA: Hi. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You must be Kara. &gt;&gt; KARA: Yes. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: How are you? &gt;&gt; KARA: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Nice to meet you. Blind date. &gt;&gt; KARA: Yes. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: So what do you do, besides being the Playmate of the Year? &gt;&gt; KARA: I model. I do modeling and hosting, but ultimately I want to produce. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah? I want to start a production company eventually, but for like movies and music. Kara's really hot. She's very nice. I think we're really connecting. I'm 22. &gt;&gt; KARA: Don't lie to me. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No, I'm serious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She looks cute. She looks like Rob's type. &gt;&gt; KIM: All I see is, like, platinum blonde hair. She looks really, like, tiny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, she looks really petite. &gt;&gt; KIM: I so want to call Rob and pretend like we're not here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Call him now. Call him now. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Rob, how's your date going? It's going well. I'm with my date, eating right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is she gorgeous? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I mean, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm being rude. I got to go. See, they're always bugging me. &gt;&gt; KARA: But they mean well. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No, they mean well. They're just looking out for Big Rob. &gt;&gt; Ow! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If we weren't looking so hard... &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You don't want to do it again? &gt;&gt; KARA: Probably not. I don't really want to do any more, like, nude stuff. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: So do guys hit on you a lot? &gt;&gt; KARA: Not really. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: They don't? I feel like they would. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, stop. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Who goes there? What are you guys doing? This is ridiculous. My sisters are spying on my date. I'll be back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, what a coinky- dink. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You guys, why are you guys here? You guys just made this so weird. I can't believe my sisters are here at this dinner. I look like akid. Sorry. &gt;&gt; KARA: That's okay. What else? &gt;&gt; KARA: I don't know. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: So pretty much my chances with Kara are completely ruined thanks to my three sisters. Sorry my sisters had to ruin that. &gt;&gt; KARA: Bye. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: All right, bye. I will never have a chance with her after this date. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY:, I cannot believe he's still here. I mean, time to leave, buddy. Thank God, he's gone. Finally. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to take out the trash. It's this box and the stuff in the back, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's, like, a homeless man... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's a homeless man digging in the garbage cans. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have a little compassion. Maybe there's something you can do for him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; Hello, how are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's your name? &gt;&gt; Shorty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shorty, I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; Glad to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am not trying to be rude or anything, but a couple of the people are complaining. I think that people want you to move to a different area if that's okay. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am, I will do that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Shorty, you dropped your sweater. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel really bad. My conscience is kicking in. : Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That homeless man that's been, like, outside. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? I told him to leave, and, like, he was walking away, and he dropped his sweater, so I, like, ran after him and I was like, "What's your name?" His name is Shorty. And he's like petite and little. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aw. That's like my name. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one's offered to ever help him. It's really sad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's call Mom and ask her what we should do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me call Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dilemma. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's, like, a homeless man... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's, like, a homeless man digging in the garbage cans. What do we do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have a little compassion. Maybe the guy's really down and out and he doesn't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Obviously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, obviously. That's why he's outside rolling in dirt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, bad attitude. This is a great time to tell Khloe that it's not always all about us and that maybe once in a while it's a great thing to help somebody else out. See if he needs something to eat, Khloe, and maybe there's something you can do, you know, for him. It's somebody that's obviously a lot less fortunate than we are, and I think that you should just think about what you would want somebody to help you with. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, gabby gab, you're right. Love you. Hi, Shorty. Oh, this is my sister, Kourtney. This is Shorty. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Shorty. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: How are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: People call me Shorty, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is my little Shorty. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: You're a little teddy bear. You're as short as I am. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, I'm 5 feet tall. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just feel bad sending you away. I want to help you a little. Come with me in my car, and I want to take you to get showered and cleaned up. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think Khloe is absolutely insane. How are we going to bring a homeless guy into our house where my two little sisters are? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shorty, you can sit on this side. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can get over on that side. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Yeah, I got it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know this seems crazy, but what the He seems like such a nice guy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So this is our house. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Welcome. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: This ain't a house. This is a mansion. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shorty needs a shower, and my mom told me to do whatever I needed to to help him, so I'm going to use her shower. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to get you some scrubbies. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think this one is good for, like, your whole body. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like a loofah. It exfoliates your skin. When was the last time you had a haircut? &gt;&gt; SHORTY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't know? We're going to trim you first. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Looking good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're starting to look handsome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you feel better? &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I'm going to get you some clothes now. I have a great wardrobe that I'm going to pull for you. Kourt, do you think Bruce will care? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, he won't mind. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce never wears these. Get you some underwear. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm dressing you nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shorty looks like a new man. Then he smiles, and I notice his beautiful empty mouth. When was the last time you've been to the dentist? &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Nah, I ain't been there for a while. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You haven't? &gt;&gt; SHORTY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to go to the dentist? My friend is a dentist, and he's amazing. I could call him. It'll be fun. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A mouthful of gold. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: I'll be there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I've got to get him over to a dentist. Oh, my God. Hi, Bruce. This is our friend, Shorty. And this is our dad, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you know how many people have taken a shower in here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to barf. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're going to take him to the dentist? What are you going to have his teeth whitened? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Bruce. Hi, girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, girls. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, this is our friend, Shorty. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: These are my sisters, Kendall and Kylie. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm Bruce. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Shorty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Shorty. Nice to meet you, Shorty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We borrowed some of your clothes for Shorty, and we gave him a bath and everything. And we cleaned him up, and now we're going to take him to the dentist. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And we shaved his beard. Can I talk to you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe, when she was little, she used to bring home strays-- stray cats, stray dogs-- you name it. Now she's getting older, she's bringing home stray people. Now you're bringing home homeless people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm being nice for the day. I'm helping. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That is a nice thing. I'm not putting you down for doing it. It's nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I offered him food, I set up an appointment with my friend that's a dentist, and he's going to... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're going to take him to the dentist? What are you going to have his teeth whitened? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I asked him to make a set of dentures for him. I'm being a Good Samaritan. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you going to pay for this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? That's nice of you. Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I borrowed some clothes of yours. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I saw that. I kind of noticed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it's okay. That's not all you're going to donate. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? What do you mean? I kind of liked that shirt, by the way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They already made a dentist appointment for Shorty, but I can't take him. I really want to take Shorty to the dentist, but Kourt, Kim and I have a photo shoot we have to do in an hour. So I was wondering if maybe you could take Shorty to the dentist. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just got finished with carpool. Now I have to carpool the homeless guy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So why don't you take Kendall and Kylie? They... take them with you. Bye, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye. Come on, Shorty, a little teeth action. &gt;&gt; Hey, Bobby. &gt;&gt; Hi, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe called? &gt;&gt; Yes, you're in. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got an appointment. Shorty, you're in. Yeah, by the way, nice shirt. &gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Dr. G. &gt;&gt; Hi, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; Good to see you, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is Shorty. &gt;&gt; Hi, Shorty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Doctor G. We're gonna have him kind of checked out. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Good luck, Shorty. We'll wait out here. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go get him. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How do you become homeless? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How do you become homeless? You know, they don't have any money, they don't, can't stay any place and, you know, they need a little help but they wind up on the street for a while. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Will I ever be homeless? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Never, in a million years will you ever be homeless. I'll make sure of that. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's see what you got. Open your mouth, let me see what you got. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...I feel so bad that we just, like, ditched Shorty off on Bruce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The cutest man I've ever met. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shorty. He's our homeless man that we adopted. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, right, you did not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, the homeless guy that we took in and we brought him here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You didn't know that we did that? &gt;&gt; KIM: You did not bring in a homeless guy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, <i>Bible,</i> we found him at Dash. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, at Dash? Shopping at Dash? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you have any idea what we're gonna do with him when we're done? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe, all right, I'm here at the dentist. But, uh, what am I supposed to do with Shorty when I'm done? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, take him to a hotel? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A hotel? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I tried to find a shelter that I was gonna take him to today but all of them are full or they close early. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, old Shorty's getting pretty expensive for me here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you, Brucey, I love you. Tell Shorty I said good-night. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Talk to you later, bye. &gt;&gt; ROB: What's up, bitches? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, you're here. Why haven't you returned any of my phone calls? I called you three times. &gt;&gt; ROB: Maybe because you guys ruined my date again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How did we ruin your date? All we did was go there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We went to give you that little extra oomph that you need. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm 20 years old. I don't need an oomph. &gt;&gt; KIM: You looked like the coolest dude in town having sisters like us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have the coolest sisters, are you kidding? &gt;&gt; ROB: It doesn't matter, nobody cares about my sisters. I'm not a little boy. I don't need you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Kim, suck his ... any little harder. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim, Kim's always the best out of the three. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, right, Rob, you know you like me the best. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, all you do is talkabout us. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'll accept the apology, but I'm never gonna tell you when I have a date again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We can find you no matter where you are, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: What number is he in? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're not really sure what to do with Shorty. We don't wanna put him back on the street, so we're gonna take him to the homeless shelter. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shorty! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Show us your teeth! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. You look like a new person. You shaved more of your face. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh, you did. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: High five. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shorty is a completely different person. He looks so good. He has brand new teeth. He shaved even more, and I can tell that his confidence has gone way up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Shorty, nice to meet you, I'm Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He really likes hugs. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shorty looks amazing. He has sparkly blue eyes. He looks stunning. Are you ready to shake, rattle and roll? &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you think all your friends are gonna say? They're gonna be jealous, huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: I bring out the good? &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Yeah, you did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw, that's so nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aw, thanks, Shorty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're in the car and Shorty is loving himself some Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've got Shorty's arm around me. I think he's in love. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're almost at the shelter. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: I got along with you real well just then. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks, Shorty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's getting pretty close. I'll let them have a moment. Are you gonna miss us? &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're gonna miss you. We're here, you guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, Rob, this place is like a freaking mess right now. Everybody was in my bathroom. Do you know how many people have taken a shower in here? &gt;&gt; ROB: That's bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And if one more person leaves the seat up on the toilet, I'm gonna barf. Oh, my God. Look up there on the thing. There's a bird. I swear to God there is a bird in the window. Bird! &gt;&gt; ROB: I can try to like catch it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've got a great idea. We're gonna scare it but not a lot. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom... don't. Mom, hold this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, all right. Okay, don't fall, Rob, because if you fall you're gonna fall on me. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob! Take this, grab the bird really gently. &gt;&gt; ROB: I got it, I got it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You got it? Okay, now... &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, Mom, Mom, don't. Okay, stay there. Stay there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, jump down over here. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, now, now, now, careful. &gt;&gt; ROB: Stop, stop, stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I swear it's gonna fall out the bottom, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, I'm letting it free. I'm freeing it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, all the way out there so it doesn't fly back in the house. &gt;&gt; ROB: Free, little bird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, yay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's wrong? Are you sad? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think at the end of the day it really feels good to help somebody and know that they appreciate it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You gonna miss me and Kourtney? &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Well... You know what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want my bracelet to remember me? It's an angel wing, so you're always gonna be protected. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, bye, Shorty. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Remember your bracelet. Keep the bracelet. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: I will. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Take care of yourself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe and Kourtney did a really great thing. I'm really proud of them. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: You're real sweet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you, Shorty. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shorty, we're gonna miss you. Call us, okay? &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Okay. I will. &gt;&gt; KIM: See you later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye. &gt;&gt; SHORTY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's so sad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get it, Shorty. Mom, you were right and I hate to say that, but I actually enjoyed myself with Shorty today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So did I. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See, you really inspired somebody to be better and to better their own life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because I treated him like a human being that he is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He cried when he left. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He was so cute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He cried? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He cried.
