- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; NEWSCASTER: Lamar Odom in critical condition. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna go back this afternoon, see what Khloe needs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think she was leaving his side. &gt;&gt; KIM: I heard that Scott has gone to rehab. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I hope that he'll want to stay. So we're throwing Mom a party. &gt;&gt; KIM: An epic party. We're doing this video for her 60th birthday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have to record it in a studio. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who's the Beyoncé, guys? We all know it's me. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: There's some pics you cannot tell you're pregnant. It's the weirdestthing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, it's so... Stephanie said that. From the side, you can see it more, but... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I know, but, like, right now, uh, you don't look pregnant at all. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Yeah. I went to this Ellen DeGeneres event, and I said, "What did show?" And she said something how she didn't approve of gay marriage. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: And so I was like, "Oh, my gosh," like, 'cause then I guess Ellen was talking about how she just doesn't understand how Caitlyn wants to be accepted, but she's still Republican, so she doesn't believe in gay marriage. So Caitlyn called me yesterday, and she was like, "You know, I I used to think that, and now I've opened my mind, and that didn't really come across." And you know the headlines are gonna be, "Bruce Jenner says..." Yeah, so she kept on referring to herself, like, twice in the conversation, as "Bruce." And I was like, "Uh, you mean Caitlyn." He's like, "Uh, you know what I mean." &gt;&gt; SIMON: Sh... He did think at the time, and now she doesn't think. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Would you guys judge me if I had one more Fruit Roll-Up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I won't judge you ever, because you're living my dream, like, you're-you're eating everything I wish I could do. We have so much going on in our lives. This week, it's birthday week of hell, 'cause it's every day is a different birthday. &gt;&gt; KIM: Caitlyn, Kendall, Mom. So tired just thinking about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, uh, just a crazy week for everybody. We're all trying to be there to support Khloe. Because of everything going on with Lamar, she hasn't even been able to, like, take a breath. Kim and I kind of took over with the party. We're excited, but it's, like, bittersweet at the same time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so Mom knows about the party. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She just doesn't know everything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, is James coming? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He has a game Saturday, so it depends. How do we feel that I'm going to the game on Saturday? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, you can go to a basketball game of your boyfriend's. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I mean, Khloe finally moved on. She is dating someone new that she adores. And then, you know, this happened, so I can't even imagine the internal struggle that Khloe must be going through. It must be hard for Khloe. There's a lot of decisions that she has to make. But we'll all be there to support her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kobe did physical therapy with him yesterday. It was really cute. They were saying... &gt;&gt; KIM: Does he remember Kobe? Like, does he know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I said, I go, "Did you have a nice morning with Kobe?" He said, "Intense." The situation right now is incredibly fragile. Hospital life is not fun, and it's depressing and sad, and I am very protective of Lamar right now. I feel so guilty being away from him. Even though I have technically left the hospital, my brain is still at the hospital. I get super-anxious. I was talking to the nurse, and I said an employee at the Vegas hospital asked Lamar the day he woke up out of a coma, can he take a picture with him? I'm like, "If I'm not here, Lamar's never allowed to be alone with a nurse or anyone. I don't want anyone asking him for photos." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to go back to the hospital. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do eyebrow pencils smell? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Just kidding, it doesn't smell like anything. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, I was so confused. Do you want to know something? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You have to promise you won't tell anyone. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Prom-prom. Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. You're gonna be an Angel. Or, technically, would you be an Angel? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: N... I mean, not technically, but, I mean, I'll be, like, a walking-on-the- runway Angel. I cannot believe that this Victoria's Secret show's actually happening, 'cause it's something that I've always wanted to do. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: What do you want to do, Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Model. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, Kendall's dream is to be a Victoria's Secret model. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And I'm really excited. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That is so amazing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I, like, cried when Mom told me. But, yeah, I mean, you know how long I've wanted to do this. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mmm, I bet. When is it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The 10th. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, dope. I think I'm going to, um, Dad's thing on the 9th or something. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, sick. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So maybe we should come and support. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um... I mean, yeah. I... I'm still, like, figuring all of that out and, like, figuring out what I want to do. You know, I already feel like sometimes I have to, like, prove myself in the industry that I'm in. I'm just trying to be professional. So to have my whole family sitting there, it's a media frenzy. I just want to, like, do the show and not have to worry about anything else. I mean, obviously, I want you guys there, but I'm just thinking about it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to get one of those, um, some cool jackets. So let me go to my app. How do you feel today? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. So I want to tell you about your birthday party. We want you to be as surprised as possible and just, like, not really be a part of it, but I think you need to know the dress code because it is theme. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Swear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So much fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: '20s, glam, black tie. Like, so major. You're gonna die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think you should either do, like, a long gown, uh, or, like, really, really short, you know? With, like, fringe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's gonna be fun. I like a theme. that theme. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just, you know, we were, like, debating, do we change the date, do we keep the date? 'Cause it's the day after your birthday, which is Lamar's real birthday. But we can celebrate him too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. It's a celebration. I'm so overwhelmed with what's going on with Lamar, but at the same time, my kids have been putting a lot into my birthday party, and it makes me feel really, really good that they would even want to do something like this for me. All right. Well, I'm excited. And really old. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh... so, for Mom's video, did we ask Cici to send a clip? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm calling her right now-- this is absolutely disgusting. Donna, two seconds. I'm with Kourtney. Did we ask you to give us a video that says she loves you. &gt;&gt; CICI: No! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What the? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Chaunch! We asked my mom's old friends and family members to record their own part to include in the video, and now we're just trying to get everyone to send them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, Kourtney's baby daddy's in rehab, my something's in the hospital, our brains are crazy. Come on, you "shabba shauncy shoon," let's do this. &gt;&gt; CICI: I just washed my hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Put your hair up in a towel and just say she loves you. &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, you're gonna die! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going to therapy today with Scott at the rehab place. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you feel? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, I'm fine. Just anxious. I hate doing that kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. Just, like, annoying that, you know, you have to go, like, talk about... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The same thing over and over again? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so draining. Your second time seeing him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Even though mine and Kourtney's situations are very different, we're going through... so many of the same things, and it's so hard. Like, it's like playing a tug-of-war with your heart. We're stuck to them, somehow, but we still want to, like, proceed with our lives. We don't know what's right or wrong. It's... I don't... it's just crazy. The amount of pressure that's on me... they all say, "You know Lamar wouldn't be surviving if it wasn't for you. You know Lamar. Well, don't leave here without Lamar." I'm not, you guys, okay? I'm trying. But I had a life before this happened. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, why does everyone forget this whole situation and want me to ruin my life? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, who cares about what everyone else thinks? It's about what you know. You just need to be confident in your decision. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I want to live the life that I was already living before this whole thing happened! Kylie, why aren't you taking this seriously? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, you're so annoying. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Because I'm having issues... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it doesn't matter. This is about somebody else! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm going to cry! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tonight is the big night and I'm really, really excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I had a life before this happened. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, why does everyone forget this whole situation and want me to ruin my life? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, who cares what everyone else thinks? It's about what you know. You just need to be confident in your decision. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I want to live the life that I was already living before this whole thing happened. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, you shouldn't feel guilty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have to take care of yourself, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I know I have to start my daily routines again and I have to get back to my normal life, but it's hard to not feel guilty. Going to work or, you know, promoting my book or things like that, that I was so excited about, I feel, like, selfish. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But just when you make plans, God laughs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, don't steal my quotes. Oh, my God! What?! Cici, yes! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, Donna... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just look at the visual, just look. &gt;&gt; CICI: She loves you. Don't put my bra in there. Just the front part. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you mean? It has to be. &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, no! Don't put the fr-- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have stuff in here, I swear to God, older than you are. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Is there a picture of you actually wearing this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes! Oh, my God, I-- &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Was the, were the pictures black and white back then? Can you tell, like--? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, okay. You're grounded. No, they'recolor. Leave it to you to cheer my up, Jonathan. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why are you upset? I don't even, like, believe that you're 60. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. How cool is that stuff? Some of it. Is that cute, Kim, for me if I wanted to change? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're freaking me out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, well, I mean, I'd have to still see it on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, let me try that on. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom loves a theme, so we wanted the party to be, you know, uh, some kind of dress-up party. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is for the after-- older Kris is going younger. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really like it, actually. &gt;&gt; KIM: I set up this dress fitting. We just want her to have a good time and not worry about any of this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had her get this, 'cause I saw it in the catalog, but I think... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh,stop! &gt;&gt; KIM: No, you're in a carwash. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Carwash! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That is the Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, and it comes in black if you like it that much. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God! We need another performer. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You guys cannot just have one person. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's what Kanye keeps saying, but who? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Him in a minute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Miguel? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, I think Kanye's gonna have to step in and do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: He has to do something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, here's the white, but I don't have-- &gt;&gt; KIM: It's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't have a Spanx on. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So then I would-- &gt;&gt; KIM: This is it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: These shoes are actually comfortable, but the other ones are sexier, so I'll wear the other ones. It makes me feel really special that they're so excited about the party and they want every detail to be perfect, including my outfit. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I can't wait for the fitting for the 70th party. That fitting is gonna be special. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You son of a bitch! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yay! Oh, my God. Are you pregnant? &gt;&gt; KIM: Happy birthday! There's so many birthdays going on, and we've been so busy planning my mom's party, so I'm just really happy that we can pull off having a family lunch with Caitlyn and being able to give her gifts and really enjoy the moment. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, doesn't everybody look nice. I love that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 66. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow, you're almost 70. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I'm traveling across the United States in a bus. Kind of "Trans in America." First, I get to go back to New Glamour. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's exciting. And you should go to the Victoria's Secret show. Kendall's walking, but it's a huge surprise and it's a really big deal. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: She's walking in Victoria's Secret? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a secret. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's a surprise. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you should go. This is, like, the one fashion show-- &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, I should go. You're absolutely right. &gt;&gt; KIM: You and Kylie should go together. Don't say anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do not say anything. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: How cool is that? Kendall always said that's, like, her fantasy job. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: God, I'm so proud of her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm, do you want a birthday gift? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Ooh, birthday gift? Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do we have them? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is just from me. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Okay. Look at that bag. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Cute. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Isn't that nice? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You said you needed a brown bag. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Very nice. Thank you. Finally, the perfect birthday gifts. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: After all of these years. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad, tell us how you feel to turn 66. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: But I'm just one year old. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're one years old? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I'm one year old. Yeah. My first real birthday, um, I feel absolutely wonderful. I'm just very excited about the future. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Cute. Love you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Love you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think the sleeve length is good, right? &gt;&gt; TAILOR: Let me see. Even want to show a little bit more, uh, sleeves. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: With the white? &gt;&gt; TAILOR: Yeah. So we can make it, like, half-inch shorter. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wow, this is so different than when I was here. It was not... There-there was, like, nothing. It was all empty. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is so good. I love this. Is this '20s though? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is. I don't know what kind of shoes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I like that better. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For my mom's party, everyone's going all out with these, like, jeweled gowns. And sometimes I'm just not a dress girl. I took my inspiration from a Helmut Newton photograph, and I'm going to wear, like, a Saint Laurent men's suit and be, like, for the night. &gt;&gt; KIM: How was it, when you went to go see Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, it was good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was happy to go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I'm glad you went. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have been going to visit Scott in rehab. And I know nothing's gonna change overnight, but I'm really proud of him for taking this step. And, you know, I'm here to support him in any way that I can. He kept saying, "Thank you for coming." &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, that was nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was good. I'm glad I went and didn't wait, 'cause Mom was like, "You got to live in the moment..." &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "...and go." And who knows what next week will bring? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, it was good. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. I love your jacket. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Thanks. How did everything, uh... work out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. I mean, fine... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you back? Do you go back? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I've been all weekend. I'm going before the party. I'll be there for a few hours today. I'm just... It's the most draining thing of life. Every time I leave the hospital, I get super anxious. I don't know. It's just my heart wants to be there. I am the power of attorney. I'm making all of his medical decisions, and I just want Lamar to know that he has a support system. &gt;&gt; MAN: Give us 15 minutes. We'll get it perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got to call Mom, so don't talk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How did you get Mom out of the house? &gt;&gt; KIM: Corey. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What did he say? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. He... They never came home last night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shh! It's Mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What time is she coming home? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing right now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm with Corey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then I have to race home and shower and then go to Kim's. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We want to keep this video an amazing surprise. We have to shoot so much footage, so we got to try to get thistogether. Okay, well, I'll see you at Kendall's birthday party tonight... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...'cause I'm gonna go by the hospital for a few and then I'll just meet you guys at Kendall's. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I love you, too. Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's eat our salads, then, while we're waiting. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. Guys, I will no longer be a teenager, as of 11 hours from now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's insane. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm the one who told you that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yesterday, Lamar was so aware. Like, even when he saw you and he, like, laughed... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I was going to say, how different is he from the last time I saw him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, so, like, I have to... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is he going to fully recover? Like, to be able... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think so. Well, they can't promise me, but he has ninelives, that kid. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What do we have to do now? &gt;&gt; KIM: We first have a group shot in the car... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, right. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and then we have to do solos on the treadmill. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have to do a phoner. See you guys later. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's our only group shot, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have one hour left to get everything done and we have to jam through everything-- like, every minute of this hour is used. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's fine, we can still do our... yes. But we can still do our solos. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My sisters and I are going to do our individual treadmill shots until Kylie's ready to get her butt out here. &gt;&gt; DIRECTOR: Let's start off with the workout. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All right, start rolling. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: And... action. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was so excited when we came up with this idea, so as anxious as I get leaving the hospital, I need to make that first step and be there for my mom, too. I'm gonna do everything in my power to just have the best time. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: There's 20 left. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, Mom's gonna be home in 20 minutes! We have to do this! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, let's go. Where's Kylie? Wait, hold on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who cares? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't want a closeup. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Guys, we gotta film this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, once this is done, this is gonna be the most epic thing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's gonna be so good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you guys, everyone, put some pep in your step. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I agree. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All right, you guys ready? I'm gonna start rolling this. Hot. awesome. Such a good video. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, Kylie. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You guys all look really good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I look at Kylie and she's just, like, not even singing. All I'm asking Kylie to do is to give us an hour of her undivided attention. &gt;&gt; DIRECTOR: All right, one group car with the GoPro and we're done. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to carpool tonight or no? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Eh... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We can have an extra car for the ride home, in case we don't want to go back at the same time. Which should we... Is Tyga coming? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I kind of want to disinvite him, just 'cause I want to hang out. I just want to be, like, a friend thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... I don't really think that's gonna go over well. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. Right, right. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And 'cause I invited him personally, so it's not like you invited him. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Who? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Tyga. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are fighting? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I'm just... &gt;&gt; CAMERAMAN: Kendall, could you step to your left, please. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Over Tyga? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Tonight, I am celebrating my 20th birthday and I invited Tyga before Kylie and Tyga had their issue. Kylie's always extremely vague when there's stuff going on with Tyga. She doesn't really open up, to me at least. So I don't know. I guess we'll just see what happens. I think you should experience it. You always say, "I want to experience things," but I don't think you actually want to experience things, because you would experience it if you wanted to experience things. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Meaning you should experience being single. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, you're wearing a different jacket. Kylie's wearing a different jacket. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Is it the black one? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why aren't you taking this seriously? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, you're so annoying. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Because I'm having issues. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it doesn't matter. This is about somebody else. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm gonna cry if we don't... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you crying? What are you crying about? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't want to do this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought she was kidding, too. Why is she crying? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kyles... Did you get in a fight? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just, like, don't know what to do about T. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why were you mad that Caitlyn wants to go to the show? 'Cause Caitlyn's going. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because you opened your big mouth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why aren't you taking this seriously? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'll cry if we don't... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you crying? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't want to do this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought she was kidding, too. Why is she crying? Like, you think I want to be here? It's your birthday tonight, your 25 months pregnant... I'd rather be in the hospital. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, but whatever she's going through... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I understand that, but I... we're all going through things, but let's tough it out for the one hour to make Mom happy. Or is that fine? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I'll go talk to her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But, like, hur... Mom's gonna be here any second. &gt;&gt; DIRECTOR: Maybe we got it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think we have to be done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know how many times I've been going through something that I had to pull myself together for? Like, that's just life. Get yourtogether. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kyles? What happened? Did you get in a fight? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just, like, don't know what to do about T. It's just, like, he just called me, and I'm just having issues with him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Today? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Like, just now. But it's just weird and I don't know what to do, so... Whatever, I'll figure it out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, so what do you want to do? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm just gonna go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My makeup's ugly anyway, I don't even want to be on camera. I feel really, really bad that this is, like, the only day that all of us can get together, but I'm just upset right now and I don't know if I could finish it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's all right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, we're coming over at 5:00. Love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What'd she say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She just said stuff with T. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're just gonna have to work with what we have. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, all right, so I'll see you at the party tonight. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: There you guys are. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Clear your schedule. We're gonna be eating a lot. But I'm getting better. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm tempted to not eat that much. I'm, like, roly-poly status at this point. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not roly-poly. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She's much less roly-poly than last time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're pregnant. If you weren't roly-poly... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, my stomach is sticking out more and that just freaks me out, like, more. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Right, but last time, you were like... Like, the whole thing... ...was literally Jabba the Hutted out. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, look at how big my thighs are. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Right, so, now, double that and that was last time. So, in case you forgot... &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, tell me about The Edition. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: In New York? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: A hotel? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, it's beautiful, it's a clock tower. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's where... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's right on Madison Square Park. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need to go there on the ninth. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: For the big show? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why were you mad that Caitlyn wants to go to the show? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because it's something that... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's her dad and she should go to something like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She doesn't want one person there. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you can go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm gonna be backstage with Kendall. It's something that we've worked on from day one. &gt;&gt; KIM: So you're not gonna go sit in the front? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. She doesn't want anybody to sit out in the front row. &gt;&gt; KIM: So tell her to tell Caitlyn. 'Cause Caitlyn's going. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because you opened your big mouth when I said, "Please don't say a word to anyone." &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought her dad should know that she is fulfilling one of her lifelong dreams. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, not until she's ready, that's why I'll never tell you anything again like that. She wants this to be about her. She doesn't want one of us to take attention away. If Caitlyn goes and sits in the audience of a televised show-- like, Oh, my God, Kendall will kill herself. Look at this car! Cheers, baby. &gt;&gt; COREY: Cheers and a beautiful happy birthday. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know Kendall already invited T. I just hope that we can make it through the night without drama. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If Caitlyn goes and sits in theaudience of a televised show, like, oh, my God, Kendall will kill herself. &gt;&gt; KIM: I knew that Kendall walking in the Victoria's Secret show was a secret, but I didn't think that meant I couldn't tell her own dad. You know, I said something. Like, she just needs to slow down. I feel like sometimes we hide behind my mom and think, because she's our manager, she can just, like, fix everything. Kendall needs to, like, man up and tell her dad what she wants. So call Kendall. Let's call Kendall. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you really not want Caitlyn to come to the Victoria's Secret show? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You guys, I want everyone there, but I think it's better that no one's there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so I think that your dad is so excited, 'cause she just happens to be in New York, just call her and just say... &gt;&gt; KRIS: "I don't want you there, please come to the after party and we'll all meet at the after party." &gt;&gt; KIM: And just say, "I don't want one family member there..." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Guys, I'm getting ready for my party tonight, can I worry about this in, like, two days? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim needed to deal with it now and call you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom's just mad that Caitlyn has a ticket and she doesn't. Exactly! Okay, bye. Yeah, you'll call her yourself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Obviously I told the wrong human being. &gt;&gt; MAN: Happy birthday. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Happy birthday! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Happy birthday. I love your outfit. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Tonight's my birthday. I feel like I have a really good room of people, everyone I love. Is Kylie even coming? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's supposed to. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I can't believe she's late. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't keep track of her today. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I really hope Kylie ends up showing up, 'cause she was a little upset earlier, which I'm a little bummed about, just 'cause I was excited to hang out with her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie, get in here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, what the What theis wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm kind of distracted today because all I can think about is Tyga. I know Kendall already invited T. I just hope that we can make it through the night without drama. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's my first time having alcohol in four weeks. I am ready to get this party started. KrisJenner, you're about to get your panties moist, girl. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Did you have your publicist announce that you are going? No! You can't! You can come to the after party! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie and Tyga broke up or got into a fight. I have no idea why. It's definitely awkward to have Kylie and Tyga both here, and we're all just, like, watching. Kendall Nicole Jenner. Happy birthday, baby girl. We all love you. And enjoy your life. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, come on. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Totally knew they'd be fine when they saw each other. I totally knew they'd get back together. That's just what happens. It is what it is. &gt;&gt; COREY: Hey, babe, where...? What kind of cups do you want? Do you want glasses, or do you want to get cups? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I think we have to drink champagne out of a crystal glass. Tonight is the big night, and I'm really, really excited. I literally don't know one thing about this party, except for what I was supposed to wear. That's it. Is it hot in here, or am I having a hot flash? &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna go put my dress on and see what's going on. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wait. My dress has to go over my head. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; MAN: Well, let's stop. Just give me... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just kidding. Just kidding. &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know in these times, it was illegal to have alcohol, so, like, that's why had, like, these parties. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause he was so rich, and you were able to. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, that's cool. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Did they have lip injections back then? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They didn't have alcohol, Kylie. &gt;&gt; COREY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Dad. Just kidding. Um... like, what time are you and Kris planning on leaving? &gt;&gt; COREY: I think about 6:30. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! No, you're supposed to leave at, like, 8:00. You cannot leave a second before 8:00. She cannot get to this party before her guests get there. My mom needs to make an entrance, and we planned it perfectly. I want to see her face. I want to see the reaction. Thank God I called you. &gt;&gt; COREY: Got you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, Dad. I'm very mad at you about something, so... Did you publicly...? Like, did you have your publicist announce that you were going? Because I don't know how everyone knows, and now it's a huge story, and I'm actually pissed at you. Okay, well, then, you knew that was gonna happen, and I... That's so annoying. Okay, well, then, I don't want you to go. A lot of people assume that I get jobs from my family, but it's actually kind of the opposite. It made me have to work even harder to get what I wanted, so, I get scared that if my dad goes, that's kind of a media frenzy, and now it's kind of all blowing up. You're gonna be... take the biggest night of my life, and take it away from me?! Thank you. No, you can't! You can come to the after party. You can't come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did Kim leave yet? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is she at Mom's, also? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but she was supposed to leave for sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: Getting your dress sewn right on you. And we're all running so late. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're gonna be... take the biggest night of my life and take it away from me?! Thank you. No, you can't! You can come to the after party. You can't come. I hope you're not doing this for your own good-ass attention. You're welcome to come if you don'tsay anything, and you walk in the back door. It's just beyond annoying. I asked everyone not to come, and of course, you're begging me to come, making me feel like You know I'm a pushover, so you know I'm gonna... I understand! There's a millionshows. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Kendall is pissed. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I've already been disinvited, so I'm just staying out of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We've all been disinvited. It's her thing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, so, then, why would she even let her go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think she did. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You know what? Love you. I'm not trying to have this argument. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You okay, Ken? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's just so annoying. Literally begged me to go, 'cause originally, I was saying, "No, you can't go. I'm not letting anyone go." And she was like, "You have to let me go! No one will care about me." Duh, duh, duh, duh. I'm like, "Yeah, you say that, 'cause you're so used to being Bruce." Like, no one would have cared about Bruce being there. Everyone's now gonna care that Caitlyn's there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, there's a huge difference. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All of us aren't going anymore. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's what I said! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You are so cute. First one to wear a suit. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait. I can't wait. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. Can you be my date tonight? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes, of course. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; TYGA: This cigar stinks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought you wanted it. &gt;&gt; TYGA: It smells, though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, that's how cigars smell. &gt;&gt; TYGA: Smell it. Smells like ass, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It smells. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can I smell it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, that's... I don't know what that is. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is that your cigar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Where did you play with that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was up my You're welcome, T. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Someone mentions... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How cute is Lamar? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And you have to make a wish. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yup, we're good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's hard, it's tough, but I just can't worry about Lamar tonight. I can't be stressed about the hospital. I have been looking forward to tonight because I haven't really been out in public. It's just, I need an escape at the same time. And it's all about my mom. I want to focus on her and just enjoy tonight. Did Kim leave yet? Is that...? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is she at Mom's, also? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but she was supposed to leave for sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: Getting your dress sewn right on you. It looks good. Looks like Chanel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't we need to leave? Come on! Kim's being sewn into her dress, and I'm ready to go, so I'm getting really anxious. The clock is ticking. I do not want to be late for my own party. I'm all set. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're all running so late. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm ready. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This party is just incredible. Like, everybody is enjoying themselves. Everybody came decked out. It just came together so perfectly. Hi. It looks so good so far. &gt;&gt; MINDY: You look so nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So excited. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This looks insane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm ready to get this party started. Mom, you're about to have the time of your life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, darling. Not bad for an old broad. Kim left, so I can finally go to this party. I'm really excited to see what the kids have done. Okay. Look at this car! Oh! Cheers, baby. &gt;&gt; COREY: Cheers and a beautiful happy birthday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; COREY: Look like you're 30. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not old in spirit or heart. I'm just old in my body. &gt;&gt; COREY: That body is not old. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so happy you're here. My mom's gonna die when she sees you. Kanye's, like, been so busy between fashion shows and his music. So, you know, I'm really glad that he was able to make it to the party. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, bitches! Kim, your dress is maje. Kanye, velvet suit? guys! &gt;&gt; MAN: How's everything? Is it better? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So much better. He's off of all machines. He's doing better. Thank God. He's improving little by little, and that's all that matters. It's been a lot. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Of course it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I'm... It's my first time having alcohol in four weeks. I mean, it's gonna be... &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Enjoy it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. I have only been here for about 30 minutes, and I have probably been asked about Lamar 40 times. And with every person who asks me about Lamar, I feel like I need a glass of champagne. So... I need another drink already. Oh. Thank God. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Our mom is here! All of our moms are here! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. This looks so good. Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Happy birthday! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Incredible! Oh, my God! ♫ ♫ This is crazy! The Great Gatsby! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is the coolest thing I've ever seen! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You can tell that my mom is super impressed. I think that we got the vision really right. &gt;&gt; KIM: It has got to be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It was amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to cry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think my mom was just shocked and having the best time. You know, she deserves it, so I'm excited. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I cannot wait till she sees her video. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, guys, we've been practicing this routine for a long time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm ready. We're just kidding. We're not about to perform. But we kind of wanted to embarrass her a little bit and show you guys a video of what my mom did 30 years ago. Hit it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 30 years ago, I made a music video, because that was my fantasy when I turned 30 years old. And... of course, my girls have to show it at my 60th birthday party. Just to totally embarrass me. I love you guys! &gt;&gt; KIM: Remix! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so cute and creative and amazing and funny. &gt;&gt; KANYE/KIM: She loves you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The fact that they took the time and the thought that went into that, oh, my God. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: She loves us! &gt;&gt; GIRLS: She loves you guys! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should've seen your face. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My mom looked so happy. Like, ridiculously happy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm shocked that we even pulled it off. 'Cause we did it so last second. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom deserves it, 'cause she is the head of our family. I'm so grateful and thankful that she is such a big part of our lives. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris Jenner! KrisJenner! Bring your 60-year-old ass over here. Oh, stop cussing? I'm sorry, Smelly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want to thank you guys. Honestly, this is a dream. My girls and my son are remarkable and stunning and amazing and... Don't cut me off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, wait, wait. Where's Charlie Wilson? Charlie! Charlie? No, I'm serious. Uncle Charlie! Uncle Charlie in the red suit! yes. Uncle Charlie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was in the middle of my speech! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Shut the up.

What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe is the ! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank God Khloe cuts off my mom's speech, which was a really good move because I was getting bored of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, you're about to get your panties moist, girl. 60 and your panties still get moist. Let's go, girl! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. I feel a little bad for my mom, but you can never, like, underestimate Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, Kim, why were you yelling at me when I wanted the Godfather ofSoul? What? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: I was just saying. You cut off Mom's speech. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Mom's speech! Mom's speech and Kim K.'s speech. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, can I just finish... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Charlie Wilson! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was so happy to see Khloe just, like, having the best time and in her element. The old Khloe was back. She deserves to have a fun night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Charlie Wilson and Kanye West, everybody! &gt;&gt; KANYE: ♫ Hey, we love you Say, "Kris, hey, we love you" ♫ Everybody in the house say, "Kris, we love you" ♫ &gt;&gt; ALL: ♫ Kris, we love you ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love you! I have to be up at 4:00 a.m. This is for sure the most iconic party that we've ever thrown. Tonight was so much fun, and usually I would stay longer, but I have to get to the Victoria's Secret show. I just want to, like, do my job and be good at it, so I'm gonna get home to get some rest. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Celebrating something like this is a way to remind myself how wonderful life can really be. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Let's do this. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoa! &gt;&gt; REPORTER: I hear that you got banned from the show. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Everyone thinks I'm the jealous sister. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't live in my mom's house anymore. I just want to be in my home when I have the baby. I'm trying not to freak out. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: How is she gonna go back to, like, married life? Do you think she's, like, cured already? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like she's always like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scotty, oh, my God! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm back! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Scott. I don't want to end up in the same situation.
