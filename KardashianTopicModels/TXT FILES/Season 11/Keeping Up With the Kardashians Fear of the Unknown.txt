- Previously on... Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just been a really hard time, going from, like, having all of you guys to having nobody, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It breaks my heart to see her in pain. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just hope that somehow God can, like, give me a chance... or us a chance at this or something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, I don't know if there's a day when, like, Scott can get it together and be... change. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you gonna wait, like, that long? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm not waiting. I love Scott, but I've gotten to a place where I'm just living life again. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just organizing North's closet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, this used to be Kylie's closet. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, now it's getting some good use. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I just found this as I'm going through all of my papers and Kylie's stuff. Can I read it to you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "I Am." "I am from the horse playground of Hidden Hills to the enormous community of Calabasas. I am from my muddy backyard of fun to the trees we once climbed to the rainy outdoor playground where we played Indians. I am from my loving parents." &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, you're not gonna cry when you're reading something she wrote. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is the stuff that makes me so sentimental. I don't know what's wrong with me-- I always get sad. &gt;&gt; KIM: So are you saying you're mad I took her room? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm glad you're here, but it just makes me sad that she's not here. How cute is this? &gt;&gt; KIM: She painted that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's her self-portrait? She'd be mortified. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can you change my hair color? &gt;&gt; NICK: Yeah, what color you thinking? I can't go to black, but I can do any color. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Maybe you can do blonde with this color. &gt;&gt; NICK: I think that'll be a good contrast. So you have, like, all warm tones. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; NICK: Okay. Whatever you want. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; NICK: You look perfect. Perfect, perfect. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm doing a photo shoot right now for my Lip Kit with Dolce. I just feel like there's been a lot of attention around my lips, and every single time I would announce what lip liner I was using, it would immediately be sold out, so I just wanted to create my own. I think we should try to do, like, a side look for this one. &gt;&gt; NICK: Okay. Oh, I love that. Love, love, love. Come look at these. I think these profiles are great. Just find one with the hair that you love. I think the eyes are perfect. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love that one. &gt;&gt; NICK: Beautiful. That one's great as is. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love that one. &gt;&gt; NICK: Triple mark. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like we got good ones. &gt;&gt; NICK: Oh, these are great. All right, so you want to just do next color then, or do you want to keep shooting? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Next color. &gt;&gt; NICK: Yeah, cool. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You're not ready yet? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ready? I just shot. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: How's my baby? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Good. I'm shooting for my Lip Kit. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Are you camera ready? Is that the look right there? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, can I do that? Okay... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: One... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Two... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Three. That's your look? That is your look? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I don't know what my look is. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God! I feel like my dad and I get along more now that we just like to do the same things. You have to get it perfect. See how it's all blotchy? She is so funny. I'll say random stuff like, "I'm about to get a spray tan." And she'll be like, "How are spray tans, are they good? I think I want to try one." &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Um, by the way, Sunday we'll do something. We'll go to dinner, we'll do whatever. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, cool. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I think Kendall's back in town, too. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're doing a Snapchat. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Cute! &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Cute! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you like Mom's changes she makes to her house? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think they're significant enough. The table's better, but the chairs aren't that much better than what she had last time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would get rid of all the columns if you could. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, and the stained glass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You make me sound like I'm living in an old-age home, and I'm senile and you guys are trying to make life-or-death decisions for me and I'm not in the room. &gt;&gt; KIM: But even if she just got simple panes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm right here. I can hear you. Um, so, guys? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I went to go visit this doctor who does this DNA testing, and what happens is you give them a little bit of blood, but by doing these certain tests, they can tell if you're predisposed to cancer or that you should stay away from certain things because you're gonna get really sick or you have nerve disease or, you know, anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So what's the point of telling us this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The clinic is in La Jolla, down by where MJ lives. And I think I'd like to have the guy come up and take my blood and do the test, and then I'll go down and visit MJ and go swing by his place and have him give me my results. My mom is a super strong lady. She's overcome breast cancer, and I think when you have a history of cancer in your family, you really want to make sure that you can do any possible test that's necessary. &gt;&gt; MJ: You really should have the BRCA test, because my mother had cervical cancer. This family's been through it three generations. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It would be such a great feeling if all my kids would be tested to see if they carry any of the genes for cancer, because if we are, then at least we can do something about it and we're prepared. I just want you to get on my bandwagon and do it with me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, let's do it! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you're in? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So they're gonna pop by the shoot tomorrow and just do a quick blood draw. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we're all gonna have Band-Aids during our shoot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not that big of a deal-- it's a blood draw. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I cannot wait to get these things off, 'cause I'm just, like, it's not cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who created this concept for the shoot? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think Kim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But, like, does anyone get asked what we want to do or just Kim just tells us? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know, but your makeup looks so gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really? Stop. What do you want? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: That's hot. See, that's dressed like something I want. Let's keep it fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today is the day we're doing a gothic photo shoot. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Brilliant. Okay. There you go. Arms. Right there. Beautiful. You know, I'm just... love this look, it's one of my favorite looks of all time. And your face... There you go. Beautiful. Get that cleavage in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Had to get away from the cleavage, I was like... &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Good job, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MITCH: Hey, Kris, how are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; MITCH: Good, thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nice to see you. Hi. &gt;&gt; MITCH: Mitch Mulanix with Pathway Genomics. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Nice to see you. Now, are you the people that Paul was telling me about? &gt;&gt; MITCH: Exactly. What we're gonna do is look in your bloodstream for genetic mutations that are associated with certain cancers. I understand you've got a family history there. So this'll-this'll look for markers that you have it, possibly, now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes it's so hard to get my family all in the same room at the same time. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: We'll be quick. &gt;&gt; MITCH: No, I can talk while-while you do that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are we doing? &gt;&gt; MITCH: Yeah, so what we're doing is a genetic test. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So what better time to have this doctor come and take everybody's blood than right now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I have a quick question for you. There's a guy who has this new technology that if he has a sample of your blood or your saliva, that he can tell all sorts of things about you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's, like, the same thing that Angelina Jolie did, where she had an 80% chance of getting breast cancer, so she got her boobs removed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to do it? It's really, really... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Takes two seconds. They just take a little thing of your blood. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I literally don't have time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He can come in here right now and take your blood. It's, like, the most amazing thing that's, like, a real privilege to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe has always been resistant to any kind of a test. Would it make you feel better if we did a DNA test? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But, out of all of us, Khloe's the one who needs to have her blood drawn, because she had a brush with skin cancer. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I got asked to pose for this nude shoot. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This looks so cool. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: It's like a painting. Boom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't care if you possibly could get breast cancer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're all going to die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to die when you're 30 or do you want to die when you're 85? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't care. I don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He can come in here right now and take your blood. It's, like, the most amazing thing that's, like, a real privilege to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, it takes two seconds. You can do saliva or you can do blood. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, saliva, he's just gonna swab my mouth? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not gonna draw blood. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, I have to leave. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, all right. Let me go get him. Somebody... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have time for this. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How long does this take? &gt;&gt; MITCH: We need some saliva, so it takes a few minutes to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I can't be late, so... &gt;&gt; MITCH: Yeah? How do you feel about giving blood? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not in the mood. &gt;&gt; MITCH: Okay. Well, I understand your grandmother had breast and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Colon. &gt;&gt; MITCH: ...colon cancer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MITCH: I would recommend, you know, getting that test, because... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I've had skin cancer, too, already. &gt;&gt; MITCH: Have you really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; MITCH: Yeah. It's kind of scary, but you'd rather know, because if you catch it early, then you can do something about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Right. And you're gonna draw from my vein? &gt;&gt; MITCH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I-I don't think I'm gonna do it, then. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know you have some gas. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yes, I do. Why do you... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 'Cause I'm on E. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, you're on E? Uh, if that's the case, the closest gas station from here... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No! &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, you want me to put it in your car now? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: That's all I got left. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I'm putting gas in a Rolls-Royce? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes. That's a lot of gas, I feel like. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: It's not much. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can I ride your Polaris? Can I ride it? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, uh, unfortunately, that off-road one, something happened to the battery, and I'm trying to recharge the battery, and it won't take a charge. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: No toys are working. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's annoying. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: It is annoying. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do you ever use your helicopters anymore? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I've been so busy, I just haven't had the time. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I was gonna say, are all your Bruce things gone? I definitely miss the connection that my dad and I used to have. He was kind of the reason that I was a tomboy. We'd go off-roading together, and he was, like, coaching my sports teams. And, like, it's kind of weird, 'cause I feel like my dad and Kylie are a lot closer than they used to be and they're bonding through things like hair and makeup. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Don't worry. I'm still playing, except my short game is still a little chipping out of the rough. I still have the same... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I want to come. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Same problem as Bruce has, Caitlyn has, yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So what's going on out here? &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Um, not much. Let me... Yeah, let me show you what's up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: The whole... the whole vibe of the shoot, other than it's gonna be nude for the art thing, is that if you're not blown away by your picture, then it means we didn't do it right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. The only thing is I feel like my ass, like, disappeared when I lost weight. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Girl... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need to plump it up. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Yeah. But you'll-you'll be pleasantly surprised how nice your ass is gonna look. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's make it look good. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Yeah. We want to make your sisters jealous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. ♫ ♫ I got asked to pose for this nude shoot, which is going to be in a fine art gallery. I work out every single day, so I feel like, why not? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God! You're so skinny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love that dress. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Really? Everyone keeps saying that. Kourtney is for sure my favorite sister right now. She's focusing on herself and laughing again and just being the Kourtney I knew, like, five years ago. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are they ready for me? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yep, anytime you're ready. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to see one shot so you can see what it looks like? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Sure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Good. Good. Stay just like that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This looks so cool. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: You like? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I like when you cover your face better. I don't like your leg like that. Put it straight-- I just want to see what it looks like when it's, like... No, no, no. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Turn your body towards me. Wait. Yeah, there! There you go. Good, good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like I'm in my workout class. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Yeah. Forgot to tell you about that part. Okay. ♫ ♫ Hot damn. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, I like that. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: That's pretty sick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, that's cool. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: It's, like, glowing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Boom! So much for no ass. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. Did you look up that app I told you? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. How was your shoot? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. Don't I look so tan from my shoot? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Why are you so dark? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause they just make you dark. I'll show you the pictures, but these aren't retouched or anything. There's one. We're trying to pick which one. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, how cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's the other one. &gt;&gt; KIM: I like that one the best. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The hand on the floor. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. Kourtney is like a different person. Well, she's like the old Kourtney. And I think that, you know, she carried the weight of someone else's issues for so long that it really had an effect on her and her personality. And now she's, like, back and she's on fire and she's loving life. And that just makes me so happy to see. Are you nervous, like, what people will think, that you, like, did a nude shoot? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, no, because we only showed my butt. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think Scott's gonna be like, "Hot damn"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: What if, like, so many guys start calling you after that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's just stupid. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, what a great ice bucket. Oh, what? There's my candle thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, that was my candle first, first of all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Those... those are my candy jars. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They were mine first that you copied. My candle... &gt;&gt; KRIS: The candy jars? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you joking? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no, no, I found the candy jars. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I had them at Ashurst. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I found them way before that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get over yourself. You copied my bar. Did you not copy my bar? Yes or no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. But you don't even have that bar anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't even get me started. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I haven't been bugging you about this, but I feel like you should really get on our bandwagon and try and get... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: With what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...this DNA test done. The BRCA test will tell you if you have a genetic susceptibility to getting breast cancer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I don't want to, is the point. I don't really care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's unacceptable for you to have this technology at your fingertips and not go out and utilize that so that it might save your life one day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't care. I really don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't care if you possibly could get breast cancer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fact: I'm going to die. You're going to die. We're all going to die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to die when you're 30 or do you want to die when you're 85? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't care. I don't care. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's this I hear that you don't want to do that genetics test? Like, what could it hurt? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I just... like, I just want to be in my moment. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just know that Grandma feels, like, so guilty about, like, if, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna pull the grandma card? &gt;&gt; KIM: Ask him where he is. Get his address. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want you to call 911 immediately. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to die. You're going to die. We're all going to die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to die when you're 30 or do you want to die when you're 85? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't care. I don't care. All you guys say is "Put yourself first and do this and do what makes you happy," but, like, it's not in my soul to go do something like that. How is that a big deal? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because there's people around you who care about you and love you. So you need to get tested so that the rest of us can enjoy you for as long as possible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The reason why I'm fighting taking this test so hard is just I remember my dad. Love Daddy. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Love Daddy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: His cancer getting so much worse once he was diagnosed. 'Cause then it's in your head and you're mentally thinking about it. So if I'm gonna get something, I'm gonna get something. I'm not gonna live my life in fear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The fact that you could perhaps make your quality of life a little bit better and choose not to is very disappointing. That's all I'm gonna say. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh! What's up? &gt;&gt; KIM: I do feel a little bit run-down. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I'm kind of in the space where, like, these are my last few months of just North and I. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Before her world is, like, turned upside down with a little boy. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Upside down with the change... Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: People are gonna go nuts for the boy. What's gonna happen to North? &gt;&gt; KIM: She's North West. She'll be fine. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's going on with Scott and Kourtney? So, like, has she seen him since...? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: The other day, Scott had called my mom... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...to go meet with her and talk. He flakes on her, says he's sick, and then that night, Kylie and Tyga see him at a pool party. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I genuinely really love Scott, and I really hope that he gets the help that he needs, but I'm really proud that Kourtney's found herself again, and I think she should just continue to do what's best for her. Get yourtogether. And you think, "God, I have a beautiful family with three kids now." &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, grow the up. I mean, he had it all. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: He did have it all. &gt;&gt; KIM: And he really threw it away. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. So, seriously, like, is Mike all set for the pictures? &gt;&gt; JEN: Mike's gonna send you options of what he thinks will look good at that size. He's right on top of... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you tell him that I loved him? &gt;&gt; JEN: She loves you, and she wants the pictures ASAP, please. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's exactly what that means. Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, with Jen talking What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: So what's this I hear that you don't want to do that genetics test? Like, what can it hurt? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I just... It just... I don't care to know. Sometimes I feel like when you... If, like, something's wrong, and you hear about it, it makes you, like, die faster. Like, let me just live life and be free. Like, I just want to be in my moment. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just know that Grandma feels so guilty about, like, if... like, no... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna pull the Grandma card? Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I'm just being honest. Like, she just keeps on talking about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: MJ is really sensitive about it 'cause she had the BRCA gene, and so she wants me to make sure I don't have it. I just don't like being, like, forced like that, especially by Kris Jenner and Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, "I've been worried my whole life that, like, my grandkids, like, would have cancer." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, you know I am... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I mean, I feel like it does mean, like, the world to her. I mean, obviously, do whatever you want to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't even think I know anybody anymore that hasn't been touched by cancer. The chances that one of us might have something negative is there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Unless I'm doing the stuff with Dad, like, dirt-biking... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ...and adventurous things... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You should just talk to her. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't want to hurt her feelings. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Hi. How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Good. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It won't, like, make a mess or anything? &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: No, not at all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Perfect. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: So, I'm gonna ask a few basic questions... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: ...about your medical history, and then you'll be all good to go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Awesome. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? Hi. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Hi. How you doing? Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good, thanks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want MJ to have to worry about me. If one of us does have the BRCA gene, MJ would feel so guilty, so I'm totally fine taking this test for MJ. &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: Close your fist really tight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: There we go. On the count of three. One, two. That's it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, good. That was fine. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really proud that Khloe is taking the steps to get this test done. Sometimes she doesn't want to know things 'cause she takes things really hard, so I'm glad she stepped out of her comfort zone to do this, 'cause I think it's really important. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What results is Kim gonna get now? &gt;&gt; MEGAN: You're gonna be tested for hereditary cancer predisposition... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: ...and BRCA1/2. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's that mean? &gt;&gt; MEGAN: BRCA1/2 are genes associated with male and female breast cancer and ovarian cancer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Other types of cancer like kidney, colon, melanoma, lung and brain tumor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm. Cool. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Yeah. But the main focus is on breast and ovarian cancer. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that the current situation, or is that inherited? &gt;&gt; MEGAN: No, it's your genes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: So your genes will remain the same. The moment you're conceived, your genes are formed, and they will stay the same. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Either way, we're... &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...dying of cancer. So we'll see you in San Diego. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Yes. Perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Awesome. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Looking forward to it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you, guys. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Thank you. Take care. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: You want some coconut water? Here. He drank literally so much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's thirsty. He liked it. What are you doing, Mr. Coconut? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I told you I'm going to Montana Sunday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, to the thing that your friends won, or...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you taking the baby? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yup. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you taking any of the other kids? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who's gonna watch the kids? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys are taking them to San Diego. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, you're not coming? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh-uh. As much as I am not looking forward to leaving my kids, I really think that this trip to Montana is gonna be, like, good for my soul. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I hate that shirt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's okay. This is just our chill-out shirt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She didn't mean it. She was... She's just so critical. He's really good-looking. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So what's happening? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Not much. I'm so happy you're hanging out with me. What do...? I really don't understand you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Really? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You literally are on your phone... Like, we'll go to the airport at 4:00 a.m., and you're on your phone. Why? Isn't that a waste of your life? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think so. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, the moment that I know I cannot be on my phone makes me so happy. Like, earlier today, I had to sign, like, all these bottles. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hold on a second. : I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um... unless I'm doing stuff with Dad that, like, we used to always do, like, the boyish things, like dirt-biking and... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. Like, adventurous things. I just feel like you guys bond so well because, like, you're super into makeup, and I'm obviously not as into makeup as you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Maybe get your nails done together. I think you should just talk to her. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm so happy that my dad is at a place where she's really happy and she's comfortable with everything, and I don't want to be the one to kind of get in the way of that. I don't want to hurt her feelings, so don't you think it's better to not say anything? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. You should just have a conversation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is there always traffic? &gt;&gt; COREY: L.A., L.A., L.A. How are the kids getting down? Like, who's road-tripping them down? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe and... Kim are gonna take P... &gt;&gt; COREY: North. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and North... &gt;&gt; COREY: And Mason. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and Mason. &gt;&gt; COREY: Them kids are gonna drive them insane. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They'll probably sleep all the way down. &gt;&gt; COREY: No, they will not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They will sleep. &gt;&gt; COREY: When they get here, they're gonna be talking about how glad they are out of the damn car. Well, at least we're going to see MJ the Great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I worry about her so much because she's alone. Are you nervous about the test results? &gt;&gt; COREY: No. No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No? &gt;&gt; COREY: No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like the older I get, I get more nervous. I'm really glad that we're driving to San Diego to get our test results, because it's a great excuse to see my mom, but the closer that we get, the more anxious I am about the results. I don't even think I know anybody anymore that hasn't been touched by cancer on some level. You know, that scares me to death. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ah....! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ah...! Being in the car with three toddlers is the best form of birth control. Ah... &gt;&gt; CHILDREN: Ah! &gt;&gt; NASSIF: Especially with you guys, there's some other history here. You know, there might be an increased risk of cancer. You ready for the news? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like saying we take a long three-hour nap. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who wants NyQuil? &gt;&gt; CHILD: Me. Me. Me. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney is in Montana taking a little mommy break. So Kim and I and North and Penelope and Mason are driving down to San Diego. &gt;&gt; CHILDREN: Ah... &gt;&gt; KIM: Ah... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ah... (children and Khloe continue saying "ah...") &gt;&gt; KIM: I see a gray hair... from this car trip. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Being in the car with three toddlers is the best form of birth control anyone could ever have. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, everyone look. One, two... &gt;&gt; CHILDREN: Cheese... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cheese... &gt;&gt; KIM: We got it. &gt;&gt; CHILD: ♫ With a moo-moo here... ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ♫ And a moo-moo there ♫ Here a moo, there a moo Everywhere a moo-moo... ♫ &gt;&gt; CHILDREN: ♫ Old MacDonald Had a farm... ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: It's Scott. He says, "Are you with the kids in San Diego?" Scott said, "Please tell them that Dad loves them." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa. Scott's behavior lately is definitely erratic. Like, Scott just comes over and is crying and telling us he wants to change, and then disappears for two or three days. And then to be sending text messages saying "just tell the kids I love them," it does concern me. You guys, we're exiting. We're exiting! Yay! : Look at your daughter. Yeah! Thank God! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yes? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Dad. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, I was talking to Kendall, and... she was just kind of upset because... she feels like... maybe we don't, like, ride dirt bikes and do all the stuff that we used to love doing together. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah? Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And she feels like you're not into it anymore. Kendall has had a hard time expressing herself lately, especially... towards our dad. And I feel like I needed to tell our dad, because I feel like it was important for her to know. I mean, I don't think you're over it, right? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I've been working my butt off, you know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Honestly, I just... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: That's the only reason I'm not... I'm not around as much as I used to be. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: 'Cause I've been working so much. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall just needs to realize that there's nothing to miss, because Cait is still who she used to be and all she wants to do is just hang out with us. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Where's Kendall? I need to talk to her. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, you should talk to her, 'cause she feels like you're just... over it. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, God. All right, I will talk to her. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right. I love you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I love you! And when are we gonna get together and play? Oh, tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: We got dinner. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Okay, that'll be fun. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I love you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you. Bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MAN: Guys, walk away. This is private property. You guys are gonna be asked to leave. Let's go. &gt;&gt; NASSIF: Hello, ladies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is Corey. &gt;&gt; NASSIF: That's right, I remember Corey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. He's... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. How are you? Sorry, my big Gucci hoop got you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We all have our issues. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dr. Nassif is one of the greatest plastic surgeons, and he's a really good family friend. And he's also really passionate about a company called Pathway Genomics, which does a lot of DNA testing on your blood and gives you a really good idea of what's going on inside yourself. It's really nice that he made the time to come and help us look at our results firsthand so we would feel more comfortable. &gt;&gt; NASSIF: First thing-- and then we'll talk about your results here. So, one in eight at some point in their life are gonna get some type of cancer, and the five most common types is breast, ovarian, colon, melanoma and lung. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love Paul, but I feel like he's dragging these test results out. I'm nervous, because I've already had skin cancer twice, so, like, I just need to know. &gt;&gt; NASSIF: So... you ready for the news? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You've been upset that we haven't been spending that much time together. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I didn't want to, like, bother you with it. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: If you're ever upset, I want you to talk directly to me. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; NASSIF: So... you ready for the news? There's a gene called a BRCA. B-R-C-A. If you have that gene, you have between a 40% and 80% chance during your life of getting breast cancer. ♫ ♫ So all of you are... ...negative. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We passed the test! I am so relieved. We're all clean. All of our kids are good little birds, and we're all good to go and chirp-chirp away. Wait, so this might be a dumb question, but, like, this is for the rest of my life I don't have this gene? &gt;&gt; NASSIF: So, yeah, the genes-- you do not have that gene. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; NASSIF: However, all of you are still at risk-- you should still get your mammograms and exams and all that. Are there any questions on this stuff? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I'm so excited about this. &gt;&gt; KIM: We "may have significant limitations"? &gt;&gt; KRIS: My mental health is up? What does this mean? &gt;&gt; NASSIF: No, these are drugs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Never mind. Not yet. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Hey! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Come in. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: How you doing, buddy? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Good to see you. Mmm, my little baby! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What's up? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You're what's up. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am what's up. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: By the way, how's your car running? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Good. Everything else in your life good? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Great. Phenomenal. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Great? I like that. Um, I had a... actually, a conversation with Kylie. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, no. Yeah. No, it's all good. You've been upset... that we haven't been spending that much time together and doing fun stuff. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. I mean, I wasn't spending time with each other. It was just different. Like, I felt like you were bonding more with Kylie 'cause she's, like, into makeup and stuff, and I'm totally not. Like, it was just different now, 'cause we used to do, like... we used to go... like, ride ATVs and, like... dirt bikes... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah, do all that sort of stuff. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ...and you would come watch me ride my horse and, like... I don't know. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, okay, I-I totally get that. Actually, I think I'm hopefully ordering another off-road vehicle, so we'll have two at home. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Really? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: More horsepower; bigger, better transmission. Once I get that property surveyed down there so I know exactly where the property line, start building, you know, the stables down there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: And I certainly would want your input. And there's places to ride everywhere. hanging out with you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: We have the best time together. Okay? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: If you're ever upset with something that's happening, maybe changes that have gone on, I want you to talk directly to me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: The thing that makes me happiest in the world... is I just love hanging out with you. You know I have so much fun. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. Me, too. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: But... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Your makeup looks really pretty. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Coming from you, that is a compliment. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I didn't really want to tell my dad that I was feeling a little disconnected, but I'm kind of glad that Kylie did, 'cause it broke that wall for us. When I was younger, I used to be able to talk about anything with my dad, and it shouldn't be any different today. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: So where do we start this journey? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Bonding again, doing fun stuff-- where do we start? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I see a Funky Ducks over there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, let's do it. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I've never done that, actually. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I really love my dad, so I'm hoping that we can just have more of this family time. It makes me so happy. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Give me your hand. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: What do you mean, "Oh, my God"? One second, and... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Get it! &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Okay. Backwards. Forwards. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Stop. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: See, I still do fun things with you. Ooh, don't do that! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MJ: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Grandma. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How do you feel today, Mom? &gt;&gt; MJ: Fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look like a little La Jolla lady. &gt;&gt; MJ: I wonder why. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Kour. Grandma, there's Kourtney. &gt;&gt; MJ: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; MJ: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's frozen on her face. That's not a good angle, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're at Old Faithful. You want to see it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney's in Montana. She's really now having some time for herself, and that just makes me happy, 'cause that's the key to life. Like, you have to have your own sanity and be happy, too. Mason. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey! &gt;&gt; KIM: Mase, Mom. Do you see Mason? &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom sees you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Grandma, it was so cool-- we went to the DNA diagnostic yesterday. &gt;&gt; MJ: Yeah, tell me. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we all came back negative. &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, my God, I've been so worried about that for so long. All of you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, Khloe, all of us, we came back negative. &gt;&gt; MJ: Good, good, so that goes for your children, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, so our children don't have to do it, 'cause if we're negative, then they wouldn't get it unless they have something on their dad's side. I mean, they tested every last thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Down to what type of vodka that you should drink. &gt;&gt; MJ: There are certain kinds of alcohol that people are allergic to. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, yes. &gt;&gt; MJ: I really think you're allergic to two things: Botox and alcohol. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How could I be allergic to two things that... &gt;&gt; MJ: That you love? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...make my world go round? ♫ ♫ This is a good thing to tell you both-- Kim doesn't really need this lecture anymore, 'cause she doesn't do this to me, but you will do this to me. Some of these little girls, a few years ago, would go behind my back... ...and do appearances and not tell me about them, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. What's wrong? Okay, I would call his regular number. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, we're gonna have to... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why did you send me that message? Are you okay? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just... I just can't do this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What does that mean, you can't do this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe calls me, hysterical, saying that Scott sent her this text message that was really scary. It's saying that he just can't take it anymore. And Khloe tried to call Kourtney, but she's on a flight back from Montana. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you take anything today? &gt;&gt; KIM: Call the police. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We need to call the police. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I can't understand you, you need to talk a little clearer, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, we have to call the police. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Talk a little clearer, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, we have to call the police. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hold on, Mom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just can't keep doing this without my family. &gt;&gt; KIM: Go get my phone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I understand, but try to get better. You can't just give up, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need an address. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ask him where he is. Get his address. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you? Scott? I can't understand you. I wish I could. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll never meet anybody more beautiful than her, and I love her. But she doesn't love me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She definitely does love you, but she wants you to get better and love yourself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My life is officially over. I just want it to be over, and I just wanted you to know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't want your life to be over. What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Should we drive to his house right now? &gt;&gt; KIM: He's in New York. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's in New York? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, we can fix your life. There is a way to fix everything in life, but tell me where you are so I can come and help you. No, where are you, please? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? Hi. Is this Chris? Hey, it's Kris Jenner. I was just trying to find out where Scott was, but I think he's at SoHo. Oh, you are? He's very upset. How far away are you? Okay, if you cannot get in his room, I want you to text me and I want you to call 911 immediately. No joke, text me and tell me, uh, what happens. Okay, thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just can't get it together. I can't handle it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know you're not gonna do anything to yourself. You're in a very negative space, okay? You've got to stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, are you upstairs? All right, okay. Okay, as long as you're in the room, okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to go. Tell them I love... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, where are you going? Where are you going? Scott? He hung up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. You did a good job, Khloe. That was great. Chris said he's in the room, so he's gonna text me in a few minutes and give me an update. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, that made me sad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That just, like, really breaks my heart. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: She needs somebody that's stable and consistent in her life, and he says he wants to change. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Yeah, exactly. I already told him that. It looked like he was out of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you... &gt;&gt; CHRIS: It didn't look like he was sick. He just looked like he was super depressed and out of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's got to calm down. If he... he either wants to be a dad and be in Kourtney's life or he doesn't, you know? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Yeah, it's true. I just think then you'll really have no life, except for these, like, people that you hang out with in L.A. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. It's so stressful when something like this happens in your family, because he's like my son, so I just thank God for Chris Reda today, to give us some peace, just knowing that we know where Scott is and that Chris is there. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: The thing, though, I've never seen him do-- I mean, I've heard him on the phone with me a few times cry-- but he was, like, bawling, crying, when he was on the phone with Khloe. I've never seen that, like, side of him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I think he's, you know, this hopefully is his rock bottom and he... all he has to do is come home and be consistent. I mean, we all told him, "We love you so much, but we've seen it time and time again." &gt;&gt; CHRIS: No, for sure, he needs to go home. All right, so I'm gonna... I'll give you a call later when I go check on him or I'll call you tomorrow when I find out, you know, what we're gonna do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I thought Scott hit rock bottom. He hadn't. It's frustrating on so many levels, but my hope is this is the final straw for him inside his own soul. Okay, thank you, Chris. I'm so sorry to interrupt your time, I really am. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: No, don't worry about it, I'll do anything for Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, we love you for that, thank you. Bye. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: On the next episode... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've never seen him cry that hard. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I... then I got a text last night and they were like, "Oh, my God, Scott Disick's in there." They said he was so wasted. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Last night? This is just a fun activity. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm spreading myself too thin with 12-hour days. Like, what's more important-- is your daughter's sanity? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just breathe. I'll take care of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you just breathe.
