You guys don't have to like each other, but don't discredit the 25-plus years of marriage you guys had. &gt;&gt; KIM: When I'm reading article, there's just no reason to bash my mom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What up, Las Vegas? What's going on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When's the last time you talked to him? Scott seems to just get worse. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Scott Disick gets hands-on with brunette." He's a &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've worked so hard to keep this family together. I need to be done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, we need to have a talk. So I really want to get my ears pierced. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! You don't have your ears pierced? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have one hole that you and Ron Hardy took me to when I was four at the Century City Mall, and I ran out the store. &gt;&gt; KIM: Relax. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I remember every minute of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel so bad. Were you traumatized? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Duh, Sherlock. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can have them re-pierced. &gt;&gt; KIM: She doesn't have a problem. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who is she talking to? I don't need to sew up my ear holes. I want to get another ear hole. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I'm scared... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do think I want to sew up my belly button hole. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I told you to. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna sew up my vagina. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what I was thinking? I wonder if I should build a guardhouse, like, by the side of my gate, just so that, like, when you pull up, there's always, like, a guard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's a company that makes real-life dolls. They're so real that people have sex with them. That's what they're made for. We should go to the factory and check 'em out, because we can order... &gt;&gt; KIM: But why would you want to order one? &gt;&gt; KRIS: For your guard gate. &gt;&gt; KIM: Except for the fact that he cannot move and operate and answer the gate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you see those pictures I sent you? Of Scott? There are pictures of him partying. And then it's, like, all on the Internet today that they broke up, 'cause apparently he's telling everyone, like, "I'm single." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ready to mingle. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Kourtney and Scott have officially broken up, and it's really hard on her. It breaks my heart, 'cause she's put nine years into this relationship, and I couldn't even imagine what it must be like having three kids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did anybody find him today? He was MIA, like, for the last... &gt;&gt; KIM: There were pictures of him partying in Miami. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Miami? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This bee is freaking me out. Where did it go? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's right here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's a drought, so they're all looking... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, they hang out at my fountain. Okay, I'm out of here. Too many bees. I'm allergic. &gt;&gt; MAN: Ms. Kardashian? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm in San Francisco today on a panel with the former Superior Court Judge Cordell. We are sitting on a panel to talk about women's beliefs and confidence and power and sexiness. &gt;&gt; CORDELL: What is your advice for the young woman who wants to make it in the business world? &gt;&gt; KIM: People just want to put you in a certain box. I'd encourage people to find their passion. Be determined and have drive. Thank you! Bye! Thank you for having me. You're so nice to me. Thank you. &gt;&gt; CORDELL: You were great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, good. Thank you. So were you. &gt;&gt; CORDELL: Take care, all right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. You, too. &gt;&gt; CORDELL: Good luck with the baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; CORDELL: All right? Take care. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thanks. &gt;&gt; CORDELL: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm in San Francisco. I had this talk, and now I'm going home. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Good. That's good for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I just had a thought. What if I ever had the urge to call you "Bruiser"? Just for fun every once in a while? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You can do anything you want, you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I was thinking. The ESPYs. I really wanted, especially, Kendall and Kylie there. All the Kardashians and the Jenners. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Just to see the love and the support that I have received. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Caitlyn is getting honored with the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. We want to go to the ESPYs. We want to support her, because this is Caitlyn's first public appearance. But I also am really sensitive towards my mom now, because Vanity article that wasn't so nice to my mom. But I just have to balance out both people and make everyone feel supported. There's obviously gonna be an adjustment. You've gotten an overwhelming amount of support, and we all were just praying that you would, you know, get this type of reaction, and how amazing it's all been. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruiser. I saw that leopard dress. Everyone thinks you stole it from my closet. They put a side-by-side of us wearing the same dress. That's so funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's my new piece of art. Don't you love it? Look at that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "That was then. This is now." &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is my new motto of my life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How much was that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't tell you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce transitioning was a really dramatic change for me, and I'm just trying to deal with the process of just, you know, healing. I really want to wish off all the negative energy, and it's time for a fresh start. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Question. You ready to be honest? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you still dating Corey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just curious. From what I've seen from Corey, I really like him. He really does care about my mom. He has to to put up with half of this Now my mom has her smile back, and I don't really know if it's because she'ssome really young guy that's making her feel like Stella got her groove back. I'm not sure. But, hey, let her do her thing, and I'm just happy that she's getting happy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's all about chemistry. You know what I mean? You should get to know him. We're gonna go to Santa Barbara this weekend. Why don't you come with us? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not going with my mom on afest. Are you kidding? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Afest? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's not inviting you so he can knit a sweater with you. It's called intercourse, sex. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Every time I eat Mexican food, my heart runs on another level. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you heard from Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you gonna do with all his stuff? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, can you not? I have asked Scott to move out of the house. As much as we've tried so many different things, it's just, like, this is the last resort. It's really not helping anybody to keep living this way, and I feel like this is what we need to try to hopefully better both of our lives. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is Scott okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm... I don't know. I mean, this is what he wants to be doing, so there's nothing I can do at this point, you know? That's life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have the weight of the world on your shoulders, because you're like a single mom. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But it's a single mom waiting for her partner to come home. And you don't need to wait for him to come home anymore. It's just time to move on and to find your happiness. You need somebody really special in your life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't care about anybody. I just want to care for my kids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've got to find a light in your life. And it breaks my heart to see you in pain. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're going for the ESPYs? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. I know my dad's transition is a topic of conversation right now. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kendall, straight ahead! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm very nervous about the show. &gt;&gt; ABBY WAMBACH: Ladies and gentlemen, Caitlyn Jenner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you're going to Malibu Wines tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I just think it would be good for you to come and get out of the house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't really want to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know the right things to always say, the right things to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so done. I just want to care for my kids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've got to find a light in your life and it breaks my heart to see you in pain. I just want to tell you I'm proud of you, 'cause I've never seen anybody so strong in putting up with all this crap. It's amazing to feel peace of mind with the person that you're with. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, you'll have so much time in your life where someone will just come in... &gt;&gt; KRIS: When you least expect it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You'll find, like, someone that'll be such a good influence on your kids and they'll have, like, such a great life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think anybody expects you to snap out of it, but you're gonna be okay. You've got all of us. &gt;&gt; KIM: As difficult as this is, to see Kourtney go through this situation, I really think this is a step she had to take. It's time. There's just been too much of the same behavior for years. I know it must be really hard, but I think a new beginning for her is really necessary. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's okay. Let's look on the bright side. Now I have a huge closet, guys. There's actually a lot of bright sides. The closet is number one. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at you! How is your stomach so flat? You are such a freak. What a pretty view. This is the Khloe I love. This is the best shape you've ever been in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not there yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, you are. You always say that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm... &gt;&gt; KIM: You've been saying that for two years and... I don't know how much closer you're going to get. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause it's so... I am just uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your bellybutton is tiny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bellybutton? &gt;&gt; KIM: That is, like, my pet peeve. Mine is so big. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you mean? I hate bellybuttons. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but yours is so good and small. You literally look amazing. I feel like our brand is known for being sexy, and there is nothing sexy about me. Kourtney doesn't really bring the sexy, I'm not gonna lie. It's all up to you, right now. Let me pass my baton on to you. You've got to do some sexy shoots. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't. I can't. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just can't. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? You have the best body. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, I love you. I don't, I can't. I can't be in a two-piece. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you are in a two-piece bikini, it'll be a sensation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I can't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just trust me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think I have body dysmorphia and I'll never feel like... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll go next to you in a bikini, pregnant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No! &gt;&gt; KIM: Trust me. Khloe definitely has insecurities, but what girl doesn't? I just know it'll be good for her confidence. This is her time. She's in the best shape ever, she works out every single day... I think she should show it off. You've got to trust me on this. It's your time to shine and you need to do some shoots. You don't even have an option. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, I don't want to do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you don't have an option. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I won't! &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't have an option. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh! Reign! You're so chubby. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do you want kids, Kendall, one day? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: One day. Not now, though. Not anytime soon. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you going for the ESPYs? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. I am. Um, yeah, it'll be fun. I mean, it's, like, nerve-racking, but... I know my dad's transition is a large topic of conversation right now, so in this situation, I feel like I'm extremely protective of my dad. I'm, like, nervous for her, but it'll be good. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: From everybody. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like what the public's saying? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, some people don't understand it and then some people do find it to be really courageous. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, no, it'll be good. And I know that it'll make her happy to have us all there. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, Kendall's fears, from the beginning, has always been, you know, her concern for people bashing Caitlyn. And lately, people have been questioning, in the media, whether Caitlyn is deserving of this award or not. I don't want to upset my mom, but I think the Kardashian girls also have to go to support Kendall and Kylie and make sure that we're there for them. It'll be really good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think so. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, you just have to remember, like, Bruce's job was public speaking. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: The only thing I'm nervous about is if she'll trip walking up when she gets the award. That's, like, the only thing, because... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I feel like she has more practice than we think. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Last pregnancy, I wanted every junk food you could imagine. Relax. It's not as big a meal as you think, okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, what is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never said one thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Every time I eat meat, I just look at it and I'm like... Beans and chicken. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you're going to Malibu Wines tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Corey, Mom and I. Um, and I talked to Kim and she said that she would love to have, like, a playdate with North and Mase and, uh... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I could stay home and watch the kids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And, like, I wanted you to come. I think you'd have so much fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: What... what don't you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If I feel like going. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, I mean, I just think it would be good for you to come and get out of the house and be with your sister... We have so much fun together. Remember when I was having my hard time? You took me to the other winery in Malibu? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't really want to go, to be honest. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well... With everything going on in Kourtney's life, I don't know the right things to always say or the right things to do. Kourtney and Scott have been together for, like, nine years. That's a lot to go through, for one person. Any one of my family members is hurting, it's just natural that I want to help them. I think you'd have so much fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's no need to go. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: You need a sexy shoot. They want you to do the cover of Complex. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not comfortable baring my naked ass. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seize the moment. Does Mom know that we're going to the ESPYs tomorrow? I can only imagine how hard it's gonna be for my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did you call to yell at me about? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, Kourt, Kim and I are going to the ESPYs tomorrow. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: KoKo... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My closet. &gt;&gt; KIM: New fun stuff? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are not allowed in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Relax. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you relax. Should I get a 40? &gt;&gt; KIM: I always like a boot bigger, 'cause you're gonna wear a sock. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Someone said to me the other day, they were like, "I looked at old pictures of you." And they were like, "You were so big." And I was like, "Why are you looking at old pictures of me?" &gt;&gt; KIM: Who said that? Is it a guy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guys and girls say this to me. It's, like, a known thing, how fat I was. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you just do so many photo shoots, it'll replace... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Will it, though? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...all the bad ones. Yes. What do you want out there on the Internet? Don't you want to replace every bad image of you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: They want you to do the Complex. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: I got you the cover of Complex. Don't turn this down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Those people have, like, the best bodies. I can't do that. is, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, they don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, they do. It's, like, legit. I just cannot believe Kim went Complex people. I appreciate the effort, but I am not like you, Kim. I'm not as comfortable baring my naked ass on a cover of a magazine. It just, it's... weird to do that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, you need a sexy shoot. You need something that's, like, over-the-top sexy. Your body's in the best shape, you need to show your body a little bit more. I'm not saying do a nude... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But not everyone is, like, comfortable. &gt;&gt; KIM: What magazine lets you pick the concept, you pick the photographer, you pick your glam team? You cannot be more comfortable. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know... &gt;&gt; KIM: You know? Seize the moment. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The pressure's on. I'm really grateful for how much Kim believes in me and it's inspiring, but it's just scary to put yourself out there like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: So think about it, because they're not gonna wait. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Or they need to get another cover girl. They're not gonna wait for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't handle this. ♫ ♫ I was typing "can you take your birth control early?" and it's "can you take your bike on a plane?" That's a good question. I wonder if you can. Oh, my God, you're gonna die. Last night, I invited people over. Mom and Corey were, like, making out last night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was very awkward. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would not be down. I decide to go to the winery after all, 'cause I'm just really trying to be as positive as I can about my situation and I need to be there for Khloe, so that she's not stuck with this making-out couple the whole day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How is this rumor that I might be the new Bachelorette? What? The Bachelorette? Mom, do we need to talk? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That would be... wild. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I haven't been in a helicopter in a really long time. What a great way to see L.A. Fun way to get Kourtney out of the house. There's the 101. Hi, suckers. ♫ ♫ : Oh, my God. That's so cool. Look at the camels. &gt;&gt; COREY: You ready for some wine? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm ready for some fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look how pretty this is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're starving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is gorgeous. Kourt, sit over here. Let Corey and Mom sit next to each other. Just 'cause you single doesn't mean Mom wants to be. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Would you guys like white or red wine to start? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would love white. &gt;&gt; WAITER: I'm gonna pour our muscat, it's basically a moscato. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is she gonna be able to breast-feed? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's pumping and dumping. &gt;&gt; COREY: She-she hasn't been drinking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, Mom, chillax. &gt;&gt; COREY: So, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm. &gt;&gt; COREY: What do you want me to do with all these requests? Is there, like, a waiting list? Or wh-what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She... Trust me, I have basketball players hitting me up left and right for Kourtney. &gt;&gt; COREY: Do-do I transfer 'em over to Khloe, and it would just be like a portfolio? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys build a portfolio, and in ten years, I'll ask for it. &gt;&gt; COREY: Ten years? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ten years? They're gonna be long gone in ten years. &gt;&gt; COREY: Ten years? We got... we got males in the house. They got to be raised by some... some lions, you know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I could never see Kourtney with a basketball player 'cause they're too tall. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's so picky. &gt;&gt; COREY: Thisthing. Mother &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; COREY: I'll teach you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; COREY: He's mad. He'supset. I got to kill him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Okay, we're out of here. out of here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at the giraffe. Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, put some pep in your step. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Will he hurt my lips? &gt;&gt; WORKER: Uh-uh, he doesn't have... He doesn't have teeth up here. He only has bottom teeth. Might get a little slobber on you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aah... &gt;&gt; COREY: Oh, my. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw, what a little baby. Aw... I love you so much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Want to take a selfie? That's the best part of life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aah! Hey! &gt;&gt; WORKER: You guys want to feed him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I will. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oops! Oh, my... Kourtney, he goes... Just shove it in there. There you go. &gt;&gt; WORKER: Do you guys want a glass of wine as well? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll have, like, a sip of wine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! God, you're letting loose. See, she's coming out. Balls to the walls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's coming... She's coming back, everybody! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am really happy that I convinced Kourt to come out to the winery today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt is letting loose. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourt, is my hair okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know what okay means. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She has her smile back, and she's slowly getting back into the groove. Time definitely heals a lot of our open wounds. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at the llamas. They spit at you, don't they? &gt;&gt; WORKER: Yeah, they're not the friendliest bunch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not very nice? Hey, camel. &gt;&gt; WORKER: That's E.T. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: E.T.! &gt;&gt; KRIS: E.T. in the boo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Phone home." &gt;&gt; WORKER: Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the cutest place ever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The cutest place ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am enjoying myself. I think it's nice to get out of the house, do something that I wouldn't normally do. &gt;&gt; WORKER: You'll want to have your wedding up here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need to find husbands first. I am so happy and grateful that I have such strong people around me to keep me feeling positive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at that bull. &gt;&gt; WORKER: Yeah, that's actually "Yakety Yak" and "Don't Talk Back." &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what I should have named Khloe and Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, you are a big &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Norman? &gt;&gt; STYLIST: Do you have in mind what you might want to do for ESPYs?

Look how cute she is-- are you joking?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Water the plants. Should we do a little...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah! Damn, beauty, your calf muscle is really on point. That's super cute, no? Do you want more? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, we got it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No wasting water now. Should I... Does your... any plants really need some water? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: So does Mom know that we're going to the ESPYs? So my sisters and I made the decision that we're gonna go to the ESPYs for Kendall and Kylie, but I can only imagine how hard it's gonna be for my mom, so I just want to make sure that she's okay with all of us going to support Caitlyn. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, look how gorgeous she looks! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look. Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I was referring to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So are you...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did you call to yell at me about today? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not yelling today, KJ. &gt;&gt; KIM: You actually might be the one doing the yelling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, boy, what's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, Kourt, Kim and I are going to the ESPYs tomorrow. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agreed to do the cover shoot. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, your best shoot ever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Keeks. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: That is everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's a ton of people on set. It's weird to do that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on with Scott? Has he seen the kids? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He'll come over today. He's going to be in our lives. So just a heads-up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did you call to yell at me about today? &gt;&gt; KIM: You actually might be the one doing the yelling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, Kourt, Kim and I are going to the ESPYs tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that you showing up at all is amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I think that that's nice, 'cause this is her moment. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are we going to the after-party? There's, like, a dinner... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think that's a little much. Do you want to go to dinner with Kourt, Kim and I after? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, I certainly would, if that's what you guys were gonna do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom actually took it really well. She seems okay and is supportive about everything. But we definitely all want to take her to dinner after the ESPYs to show our support for her as well. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So just let me know where you guys want to go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, we'll figure it out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, look at this pose she's doing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All right, crazy. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice to see you. Thanks for having me, guys. &gt;&gt; STYLIST: Is Kim coming? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, she just, like, forced me to do this. She was like, "You're gonna get naked." I've had, like, anxiety... to do thisshoot. Kim is right. I am really proud of the progress I've made. I want to embrace my body and my curves, so I agreed to do the cover shoot, and I am very, very, very nervous. It's just scary that I'm putting myself on a magazine cover, and then I'm just letting the world judge me. I really do feel a lot of pressure. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: She can just move around in that area, but I definitely want to get the room in the foreground. &gt;&gt; CHLOE: All right. Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi, Chloe, nice to see you. &gt;&gt; MAN: We're super-excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, we're excited too. I said "we're excited," but it's just me. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: Do you want to jump in for a shot? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; STEVEN: Sexy, baby, sexy. That's gorgeous. Yes, love that. Ooh, that is everything. Damn! &gt;&gt; KIM: That looks so good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No! It's horrible. I don't wear bikinis. I'm not that girl. I'm, like, a one-piece girl, and this is not that. These are, like, high-waisted shorts going up my ass. There's a ton ofpeople on set, watching you. You're basically naked. Now my white bra is watered down so you see my tits. It just, it's weird. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: All right, y'all ready to change? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay! Next one. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo, how are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't feel comfortable in my body. I don't want to do this. &gt;&gt; KIM: You seriously look so amazing. Like, in my life, I've never seen such a hotter bod. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Keeks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your hair looks to die. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's soaking wet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your makeup looks to die. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Clothes are to die. This is, like, your best shoot ever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This look I'm not sure about, just, like, the shorts, but we will make it work. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: That's great. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, the best Khloe's ever looked. This is her first, like, sexy shoot. &gt;&gt; MAN: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, she's never done a sexy shoot before. Khloe looks amazing. Her body is so on point, and I'm so proud of her. She's not comfortable in the sexy role, but I'm like, "You're so hot. It is time. Like, you have to." You look amazing. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: Thatis so hot. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I think we got it. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: We got it, we got it. That is the most beautiful body I have ever seen. Sorry, girls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't butter me up now. No, really. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: Ah, that's the cover right there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're gonna be on so many jail cells it's gonna be ridiculous. I am definitely happy that I did shoot, and I'm really happy with how it turned out, and I'm really happy that Kim forced me to do it. I never would have done this if it wasn't for Kim. I never would have pushed myself, just because I would've been too scared. Thanks, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: My best advice to you, drive anywhere, get doughnuts. Get ice cream. Get whatever you want and pig out all night long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why is that okay? I want to so badly, so why are you encouraging that? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I'm about to drive to Krispy Kreme. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, bubba. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi! Don't you dare throw up on me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's all that banging? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're finishing up the doors downstairs. I'm gonna turn Kendall's bedroom into a closet. I just have stuff in every closet of every single room, and I just want it all in one place. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You sound like the farmer who built bigger barns instead of giving away his extra crops. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your closet is so much bigger than mine. What do you think? So, what's going on with Scott? Has he seen the kids? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. I'm sure he'll come over today and see them. While we go to the ESPYs, I told Scott that he can come over to see the kids. We're trying the best that we can to be a team, living apart. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Has anything changed? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not really. We're just being cool for the kids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause I don't want you to, you know... I just want to make sure that it's fine with you, 'cause I really do genuinely care about him and love him, but I want him to know that, at the same time, he still has to take responsibility. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's going to be in our lives. We have three kids together. So just, heads up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you wearing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're going to the ESPYs to support Caitlyn. I know that Kendall is especially nervous. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's not necessary to borrow my! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're just, literally, the biggest bitch I've ever met. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Uh, touché. &gt;&gt; ABBY WAMBACH: Ladies and gentlemen, Caitlyn Jenner. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've always been really protective of my dad. I don't want her to be scared or nervous. That alone makes me really nervous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you wearing? The white? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. I'm wearing this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna look so hot. &gt;&gt; MAKEUP ARTIST: Is everybody going tonight? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The sisters, her kids, then we're going to dinner with my mom afterwards. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tonight we're going to the ESPYs to support Caitlyn and really, also, for Kendall and Kylie. I know that Kendall is especially nervous for Caitlyn. She's just worried, what if Caitlyn gets booed, what if people aren't supportive? And I totally get it. I'm exactly the same way. You ready? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, ready. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're closing the doors at 6:00. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you feel like my boobs are lopsided? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: I look so ugly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look gorgeous. I mean, your makeup and hair is stunning. The dress is pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do I look, like, huge and fat on my back, though? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kim, you're pregnant. Embrace it. You're talking to a woman who's nervous about having her ex-husband on television any moment wearing a dress. I'm really proud of all my kids for the way that they've shown their love for Caitlyn, but I've decided to sit this one out. I haven't met Caitlyn yet, and I feel like it would be so awkward to meet her under these circumstances. Turn around. Let... &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just put your hand, Kim, your hand to your side, hand to your side. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I think that looks better that this is down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, we're going in there at 6:00. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're not gonna make it, so we should go if you're not ready. You look really fab. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're great. It's perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I have my phone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're good. Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, guys. Love you, guys. See you at dinner. You look so good, Khlo. Khloe, so stunning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have fun, girls. I love you. See you at dinner. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is Kendall ready? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Almost. Awesome. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She's not taking any of my clothes, right? &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Just one brown random dress. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She can't wear that. That's one of my favorite brown dresses, so just take it out of her bag. It's not hers. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, I can't borrow this? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, that's one of my favorite dresses. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm not going to dinner like this. I can't sit. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So you can have someone go grab clothes from your house. Why would you want to wear something from my closet when you can... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Because I can't. We're going straight from the show. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes, you can have someone dropoff. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No! Kylie! It's just annoying, 'cause this night is already stressful as it is. I really want to just show that we support our dad, so we don't need to be fighting over outfits. I mean, maybe that's why we're fighting over something so stupid, but sisters. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You know, it is not necessary to borrow my &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're just, literally, the biggest bitch I've ever met. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Uh, touché. Bye, children. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm sorry your mom is such a Wait, is Dad mad at you guys, too? Dad and Mom put me and Kylie into, like, this weird position of choosing between them. Dad wouldn't talk to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ♫ My country 'tis of thee... ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ♫ Sweet land of liberty ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! ♫ Of thee I... ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ♫ Sing. ♫ That what it says? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ♫ Land where the... ♫ Help. &gt;&gt; KIM: Children died. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I was gonna say pilgrim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, the pilgrims died. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I think it's pilgrims died. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It says "land of the pilgrim's pride." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Land of the pilgrim's pride. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ♫ From every mountainside... ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Then what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ♫ Let freedom ring. ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let freedom... Why did I think of this song? Um, Scott cancels on another club. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm. Interesting. &gt;&gt; KIM: How was it today? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, he is at the house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, no way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He is there now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Were the kids excited? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How long is he gonna stay there for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I don't mind if he puts Mase to bed, 'cause that's what he's been talking about, and we'll be home after that. I just hope that we can get along and, like, co-parent and not have to deal with anything else. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know this is a really hard time for Kourtney, and I want her to do whatever she has to do for the family. But Kourtney has to be really careful, because Scott always thinks of something to weasel his way back in. So I hope that, you know, this time it's gonna be different, 'cause I want Kourtney to be strong and not get back together with him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys better hide my back fat. Better hide my face. Can't believe I'm in this outfit, I can't believe I'm in this car. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so fab. The best part is your outfit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you shaking your head for? I can't control my nipples. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kendall, turn your head, please! Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Tonight is much bigger than me and Kylie's little sister drama, so Kylie and I decided to do the carpet together. I've always been really protective of my dad. I don't want her to be scared or nervous or anything. That alone makes me really nervous. &gt;&gt; ABBY WAMBACH: Ladies and gentlemen, Caitlyn Jenner. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone is so supportive of Caitlyn. And it is so amazing to see her walking up there in heels in front of all of these people. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Thank you so much. I know the people in this room have respect for hard work. I trained hard, but this transition has been harder on me than anything I could imagine. I always wanted my children to be so proud of their dad for what he was able to accomplish in his life. You guys have given me so much support. I am so grateful to have all of you in my life. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think what my dad is doing now is so amazing. I feel like this is the reason she's on the planet. To bring awareness and everyone's watching her and what she's doing, so I think it's really, really awesome that she's doing this. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Thank you so much for this honor, thank you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My dad's speech was beautiful. I think that this is a really huge step for everyone to process the transition and it's great that while my sisters were all here to support her and I love seeing my dad happy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nice dress! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank-thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys looked so beautiful on the red carpet. The gold mermaid dress? That's, like, one of the all-time greatest dresses I've ever seen. That was so good-- &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It was insane in the sunlight, too. It was, like, 20 times better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you looked like a little Academy Award statue. The gold dress, the black dress, you looked beautiful-- &gt;&gt; KIM: How did you think his speech was? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I thought it was, um-- &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you watch it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I did. I thought she did a really good job with the speech. Yeah, really beautiful. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I started crying before she went on. Before we even walked out to sit down. I was nervous she was nervous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was thinking that would be so scary. And such a big responsibility. Caitlyn gave an amazing speech. It was very brave of her to come out on national television, live in front of millions of people. Think she did a good job. What did you guys think? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The outfit was great and the speech was great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look pretty tonight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do I normally not? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you've been looking really cute lately. You kind of came out of your "I'm not gonna get a wax or get dressed" phase. And I'm really proud of you. Like my old Kourtney's back. This has been a year of a lot of change for my family and we're all going through our own thing kind of at the same time. Tonight was a really big night for Caitlyn, but it means so much to me that they wanted to have dinner with me after and make sure I was okay. The way that they've shown such incredible love and kindness and acceptance-- they're amazing kids. You know what's really cute-- that picture you posted of you watering Khloe's plants. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. I was acting. I wasn't really watering. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please don't burst my bubble. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was watering them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: So, we were sitting outside and we were looking at the stars and the moon and I was saying that there's the North Star, and I said, "Look, there's the North Star," and she goes, "And, uh, P star, Mason star." And I said, "No, there's only a North Star. P doesn't have a star--" Why are you putting ChapStick all over you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait, is Dad mad at you guys, too, for not going to her after-party thing? When we went to dinner with Mom? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She asked me-- I didn't even know about it till the day of. And then she came up to me after the ESPYs and was like, "Are you coming?" And I was like, "We've already planned to go to dinner with Mom, I didn't know your thing was happening." And it's so weird 'cause Dad and Mom put me especially me and Kylie into, like, this weird position of, like, choosing between them. I felt really bad about not going to dinner with my dad and going to dinner with my mom, but I also want to be supportive of my mom, um, with what she's going through. So I feel like I'm stuck in a really awkward position. Dad wouldn't talk to me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad wouldn't talk to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's so wrong to do to you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Right? &gt;&gt; KIM: We asked her to go to dinner, so that was our problem? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think we probably made the situation-- &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie and I were just rolling with the flow. We didn't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I think we made that situation 'cause-- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause we decided we didn't want to go to the after-party. In the moment, I felt bad. I felt like we should've gone to the after-party. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it was just so and we thought, like-- &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: We, at some point, we had to make a stand for Mom. Did it make Mom feel so much better? Yes, I think it did. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kendall is doing the absolute best she can to be supportive and understand this whole thing, you know, we planned this dinner with my mom, thinking that that was the right thing to do, but Caitlyn is not happy with us. Like, there's nothing we can do about it now and we're just doing the best that we can to be supportive. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know my, you know my baby is due right near your birthday. What should we name the new baby? &gt;&gt; MASON: Preston. &gt;&gt; KIM: Preston? What about--? &gt;&gt; MASON: Preston Dollar! &gt;&gt; KIM: Preston Dollar West? Your imagination is wild. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KIM: I just went over my house stuff. Guess who has to move out? Do you want a roommate? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom is not denying that Corey's her boyfriend now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; COREY: How much do you miss me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A lot. Is that my car? &gt;&gt; COREY: That's your car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're so cute. &gt;&gt; COREY: No matter what, I'll be taking care of you. You're always gonna be my baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kourtney, I find you very beautiful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I just don't think Kourtney realizes how bomb she is right now. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Wow, hot damn. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's not shoot my vagina. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where's Khloe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's obsessed with working out. She's taking it to a whole new level. &gt;&gt; KIM: She has arrived. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I'm back! I would like to have a toast to my little daughter turning 18 years old. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that Kylie's name? &gt;&gt; TYGA: What, here? Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I was really looking forward to this trip to hang out with you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: What's the deal with Kylie? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She doesn't have her priorities straight and I tell everyone that. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: There's elevated blood pressure. I really hope it's not diabetes. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, actually scared. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your life is at stake. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR 2: I have your results on my desk here... &gt;&gt; KIM: With Scott, do you think you would ever forgive him and get back with him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You say I don't have a family and then we give you one-- why do you destroy it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I made the worst decision I could've ever made in my life. It's just a situation I'd never thought I'd be in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But guess what, you can make it better.
