- Previously on Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: What happened in your last delivery? &gt;&gt; KIM: I had preeclampsia. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You have a higher risk for it to happen in the next pregnancy. So we have to watch. &gt;&gt; KIM: To know that I might have another health issue really kind of freaks me out. I'm, like, actually scared. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just been a really hard time, going from, like, having all of you guys to having nobody, you know? I just... I just can't do this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What does that mean, you "can't do this"? &gt;&gt; KIM: The note that he sent Khloe was like, "Tell Bugs I love her and I can't go on without her." &gt;&gt; KRIS: He said he had no reason to live. And it was pretty scary. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott put himself in the situation that he's in. It's really about him deciding just what kind of life he wants to live. It's like, then do something about it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Cait cannot come to Mom's birthday. cannot come-- she physically can't come 'cause she's in New York. &gt;&gt; KYLIE:I was like, "That was so aggressive." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. You said it, like, in a tone where you were, like, banning her from coming. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whatever the great Cait wants. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want my name to be something like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: The great Cait? Khloe Blowy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That wasn't my name in high school. That was another Chloe's name in high school. Rob told my dad that my nickname was Khloe Blowy, and I was like, "That was not me. I'm the fat one. Who's gonna want blowjobs from the fat girl?" Being fat really saved me from being a whore in life though, you guys. Being fat and then being married. But I respect Lamar, because he still liked me fat, which is, like... I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's what his hold has been over you this whole time? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's a big deal. When a cool person likes you at your worst. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; KIM: What is this? Did you put this on? I don't think I ever used this. Oh, I can't have tomatoes, but-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why not? &gt;&gt; KIM: My acid reflux. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, your birthday's coming up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall's birthday's coming up. Mom's birthday, we've got... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Caitlyn's birthday. This month is super crazy for birthdays in the Kardashian household. This is ridiculous. What are we doing for your birthday? 'Cause yours is first. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nothing. Doesn't always have to be a big deal, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I love not a big deal. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I'm very overwhelmed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe because you work constantly and you're about to have your second child? &gt;&gt; KIM: And, like, the veins on my boobs just drive me insane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what overwhelms you? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, whatever overwhelms me, every night I give North a bottle, she's like, "Milky, Mom," and I'm just like, "Kid, I'll give you whatever you want. Just go to bed." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim is a trooper. And she definitely pushes herself. And I know how uncomfortable pregnancy is for Kim. And I want to be there as much as I can for her. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to, like, show him. I did that the other night. I went She goes, "No shh, shh, shh me." And I go, "Okay." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's amazing. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! &gt;&gt; LIZ: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, everybody. Hello. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; LIZ: I think Heather's just taping for-- &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are they doing? Will you do me a huge favor? &gt;&gt; LIZ: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Will you write to Jamie at William Morris? &gt;&gt; LIZ: Yeah, mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And tell her it's like I'm so discombobulated. And I feel like I can't-- I got to... can't get... keep up with my work. Hi, sexy! &gt;&gt; HEATHER: Don't I, Don't I seem professional? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, you do. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: During my show? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What--? Do you have the sexy voice on? &gt;&gt; HEATHER: No, we'll go right in there and I'll... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that your sexy, is that your sexy voice? Today I'm here with my good friend Heather McDonald, who has this amazing podcast. And she asked me to be on it, so I'm here to support. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: I have lots of questions for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: Well, first coming up is your birthday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, this is a big birthday. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I'm gonna be 60, so my kids are doing something. They won't tell me what they're doing. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because they're sneaky. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I have no time to, like-- I've been busy and then-- &gt;&gt; HEATHER: So, you have a big birthday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: If your boyfriend Corey's name was spelled with a K... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We would be in trouble. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: ...would you be married? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: Would you ask him to to marry you? &gt;&gt; KRIS:No. Corey and I have been seeing each other for about a year. And it's really great, but it's really different. &gt;&gt; COREY: I just want to bring a genuine happiness. Are you ready for some wine? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm ready for some fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cheers. &gt;&gt; COREY: That's gonna be us in a minute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; COREY: Romance is in the air, that's how I'm gonna be... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're rushing it. You're rushing it. I'm so used to being married. I just came out of a 23-year relationship. I don't really know how to be a girlfriend. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: Now, you guys are going on a year. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a lot to wrap my head around, but then-- &gt;&gt; HEATHER: Are you pregnant? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: You think six is enough? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think six is fine for any human being. Yeah, I'm all good within that department. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; JEFF: How are you? Good to see you. Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: You, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow, this is, like, so official. &gt;&gt; MINDY: I like it out here. &gt;&gt; JEFF: It's so official, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so serious. &gt;&gt; JEFF: The transformation. Did your mom have a big 50th birthday party? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We've never thrown her a big party. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's why we're going, like, all out. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Balls to the wall? &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom is turning 60 and that is such a big deal. My mom does so much for us, so this is our one chance to go way over the top and throw her a huge surprise for her birthday. &gt;&gt; MINDY: So, we have a whole presentation for you guys. We kind of changed your pool house in there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah, cool! &gt;&gt; MINDY: We're gonna go in and show you some goodies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, totally. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Let's take you outside. Show you the, uh, transformation. &gt;&gt; MINDY: We kind of covered it all up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, fancy. &gt;&gt; MINDY: We're in a party! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are we doing a photo booth or anything like that? Are you not into that? &gt;&gt; MINDY: Yeah, we have that one you like. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I almost feel like these pillows are too much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I agree. &gt;&gt; MINDY: You see them before the couch, which probably is... &gt;&gt; KIM: Either maybe like some tonal pillows? &gt;&gt; MINDY: Yeah, just tone on tone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I almost feel like it should be black with black. No purple. The flowers should be all white. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Perfect, okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, so we got to work on a deejay and I think we need to work on, like, a big performer, like-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, like, what rappers, 'cause I'm good in that category. My mom has thrown us the most elaborate great parties in our entire life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's get your party groove on, kids! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hell of a birthday bash. &gt;&gt; ALL: Happy birthday, Kendall! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie Jenner, happy birthday. I love you, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We can't do this half-ass. We have to do this really strong. We need to come correct or don't come at all. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can we move it outside where there's a breeze? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And we have no time. We literally have no time to get all this done. So, yeah, we got to get going. &gt;&gt; MINDY: Okay, the vanity area-- I'm big on bathrooms-- is gonna be exquisite. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. I love your bathrooms. They have everything when you're at parties. &gt;&gt; MINDY: I'm a bathroom freak, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, everything. &gt;&gt; MINDY: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm like, "I need hairspray, a comb, a this. I need acondom." They're all in there. &gt;&gt; MINDY: We like to cover it all, yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: How'd you find this place? &gt;&gt; COREY: My friend built it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, really? Cool. Hi, gorge! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; COREY: Oh, Ryan, Khloe. Khloe, this is Ryan. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, how are you? Khloe. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's like, "I need to use your car. I have a surprise for you." And I'm like, "What are you up to?" And he goes, "I can't tell you." &gt;&gt; RYAN: And he kept it a secret this whole time, huh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So fun. Corey asked me to come meet him and my mom down at West Coast Customs. I don't know for what, but he's been working on some big surprise for my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, is that my car? &gt;&gt; COREY: That's your car. &gt;&gt; RYAN: That's your car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... That doesn't even look like the car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's awesome! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was my white Range Rover. &gt;&gt; RYAN: It's like a brand-new car, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just black. It's, like, so black. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, it's gorgeous. Did you guys tint the front windshield? I love it. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah, yeah, I do it on all of our cars. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to take it today? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Where's the--? Is the showroom right there? &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah, like, he called in a favor. &gt;&gt; COREY: He had, like, 20 cars. I said, "Yo,all of that. I need you to help me make my girl smile." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw, that's so nice of you, Corey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's nice of them to do it, too; so cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but it was nice of Corey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Give credit where credit's due. He's the one who thought of it, brought it here, surprised you. Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay! Thanks, babe. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yo, yo... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not used to a guy, first of all, surprising me with anything. And then to do something so extravagant. I just... I sometimes don't know how to take things like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Pulling teeth. It's awesome. It looks so good. &gt;&gt; COREY: So I'm glad you like it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did good, Corey. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: So how's the baby doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think this pregnancy is way more scary to me because of the medical issues I had before. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: So, overall... abnormal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How was party planning? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I'm gonna need you to kind of step it up a little bit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Before you know it, it's gonna be her birthday. &gt;&gt; COREY: It's one thing to be a workaholic and make all this success and all the business, but if your ass not healthy, all thatmeans zero. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I can't just stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Do I have to sign in here? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes. Please. &gt;&gt; KIM: So because I've had pregnancy issues in the past, I'm at a specialist's office who just kind of checks for everything a little bit deeper than my gynecologist really can. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: So, how's the baby doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. A lot of movement. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: Okay. Good. Good. How about weight gain? How have you done so far with that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, in the last week, I've gained ten pounds it says. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: I don't think we're too concerned about that right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: And for some reason, my feet are huge. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, my ankles are huge. They were never like this. But my feet are, like, unbearable. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: And a little bit is normal, but always keep an eye on it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: So, today, focus on looking at size of the baby. It'll be interesting to see how long this little one is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: Yeah. Yeah. So... There's the head. Beautiful profile right here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was, like, four weeks ahead, and it had the biggest head, and, like... &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: Well, so, if we took an overall weight, that's ninety-fourth percentile. Okay. Pushing the envelope there, but not abnormal. And long legs and long arms. So we have proportionate, so... I think that's just what we're going for. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I think this pregnancy is way more scary to me because of the medical issues I had before, but the doctor said everything's fine, and I look really healthy. And I'm just gonna try to have, like, a positive attitude and not really worry about it as much. I have a more calm vibe right now, this week. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: You seem very, very calm now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: Sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: So thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KATHLEEN: Okay. You're welcome. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: What restaurant we are going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's called Blue Jam Cafe. Think we went there when they first opened a long time ago. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: When I was in your tummy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you were out of my tummy. You were probably... &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: I had tiny feet? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, you had tiny feet. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: You remember...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, here's KoKo. Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How was, um, party planning? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The planning? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, it's good. I mean, there's just gonna be so much more work than I expected. I mean, normally, Kim is there to, like, help pick up the pieces and blah, blah, blah. But now she is so pregnant, and you're not this time, so I'm gonna need, you know, you to kind of step it up a little bit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... okay. Kim is a very independent person, and she isn't one to ask for help, but with her being so pregnant, I think she just really needs to relax. Like, anything I can do to help, then I'll do it. But I'm happy to step in. I know how important this is. It's annoying, because everybody is acting like I'm just never involved, but I'm going to go above and beyond and make it good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We haven't even done anything yet, so, we need to really buckle down and figure this out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because before you know it, it's gonna be her birthday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. All right, well, I'm just pulling up for lunch with P. I will step it up. I promise, I won't disappoint. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You rarely do, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay... baby. &gt;&gt; COREY: Hey, what's up, babe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, babe. &gt;&gt; COREY: How was your day? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Once I get all this stuff sorted out, I'll be so happy. &gt;&gt; COREY: I need to talk to you for a minute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; COREY: Babe, you've been, like, working so crazy, and I'm concerned about your stress levels. It's one thing to be a workaholic and make all this success and all the business, but if your ass not healthy, all thatfor zero. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I've been working like this for the last few decades. If anyone's gonna be with me, it kind of has to be on my terms. &gt;&gt; COREY: Well, do you agree with me? Because I'm telling you, we need to relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I can't just stop. You know? &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah, I know, but you got to take a chill pill and just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Some days, I just have to work until it's done, and then, the travel... I think it's just the travel that's killing me. &gt;&gt; COREY: No, you can work. You can... you can work. You can do all your working you want, but you're always high tension, high stress, high this, high that, and that's not good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: I can't find anymore bags. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Yeah. Should we just make piles, and then find bags later? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Yeah. And we have to make sure that... &gt;&gt; COREY: That my woman is relaxing in between all this hard-ass work. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So this is gonna go in Khloe's. We'll make a pile for Khloe, and then, um... &gt;&gt; COREY: Babe, are you gonna take this conversation I had with you seriously? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Corey needs to understand, I manage a lot of people, and he can't change that. It's a deal-breaker. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott has gone to rehab. Well, he said, "I just want to get it together this time." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm surprised he went. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, for 30 days. &gt;&gt; COREY: Me worrying about your stress levels and you relaxing and everything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not helpless! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow! Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I took North and P to ballet today, and they both told me they didn't want to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: North will just say whatever P says. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then she called me "Mom," and then P was like, "North, you called my mommy 'Mom.'" And then I go, "She's just pretending." And then she goes, "I'm just pretending." Whoever says something, she just, like, copies it. Okay, so we're throwing Mom a party. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, a once-in-a-lifetime, epic, epic party. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My sisters and I have only locked down the theme. We have to think about the details. Who's gonna be our deejay? Are we having performers? Like, what's an extra ta-da at the party? She's had, like, the craziest year. It's almost like her coming-out party-slash-birthday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We should screen her "I love my friends" video at the party. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't we redo her... &gt;&gt; KIM: 30 years later. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't we redo her "I love my friends"? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, we don't have the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you joking? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, five minutes, and then we should... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Google "I love my friends"-- let's Google it. When my mom turned 30, her and my dad made this epic video honoring and cherishing all of her friends. Like, this has been a video that we've cherished our entire lives, literally. And how dope would it be to now have the modern-day version? Like, she will flip. Who's writing this song? So now we're changing all the words. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, we are. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we have to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But who's writing it? Kanye? &gt;&gt; KIM: I will. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Instead of lots of tennis? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lots of orgies. Lots of blow jobs. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like we should take up carpooling, 'cause no one carpools. Our kids aren't even in school. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm calling Kendall right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Make sure Mom isn't there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Sister! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sister! Are you with Mom? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Look who I'm with! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, listen, Kendall. We're doing this video for Mom for her 60th birthday. We're gonna re-create that video. We need Karl, we need everyone you can possibly imagine to just say, "She loves you." Will you do that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: We need you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're gonna send you the reference. Bye. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's not paying attention to us right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but she will. Trust me. We all need to contribute to this video. We have to call all of her friends, we have to find photos, we have to film things ourself... It's such a last-minute decision to do this, so we're all gonna have to put in a lot of work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know how dope this would be if we actually did something Dad made for Mom and now we're doing it ourselves? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a good start, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need to get into this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But be into it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why wouldn't I? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You talk like this all the time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, my singing is different. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Khloe, my singing is different." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't make me kick you in the face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Don't make me kick you in the face." &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, you just got kicked in the face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just have to say it like normal... Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Perfect. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to sit, so you don't... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I really do, 'cause my, uh... body gives out on me. On that note, have you heard that Scott has gone to rehab? He came here-- I just, like, had no idea he was here. And he was like, "Hey, I came by to see your mom." And, like, we sat and talked for, like, 30 minutes and it was like, he was normal. So I walk in the kitchen and run into Scott and I had no idea that he was dropping by. He wants to really get it together and wants to go to rehab for a long time and I think that it all sounds amazing. I just hope that he sticks with it. Well, he's like, "I'm eight days sober and I just want to, you know, really get it together this time, like, for my kids." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it was, like, really positive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hope he stays and actually, like, does the treatment. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am surprised that Scott has gone to rehab, just because I feel like I was just hearing he was on the streets partying. Kourt knows, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How does she feel? I haven't... she hasn't said anything to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I think she's, like, been really distant from him and just, like, wants to keep her distance. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's over it. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I think she'll be, like, proud of him and, like, hoping for the best. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm surprised he went. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. For 30 days, so hopefully he stays. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He should stay longer than 30 days. Do I want to have a positive outlook on everything and hope for the best? Yeah. Scott has gone to rehab so many times. So who knows? This time, he hopefully will stay and it will work. But that's thepart about life, is we have no guarantees. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't it crazy just to think, like, God, where will we be in a year? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't handle much more, so there better be fairies and unicorns in a year. 'Cause I can't handle much more. I'm gonna go to rehab just to chill out for a second. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You really look like Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kanye threw this surprise party together and I think Kim is going to love it. &gt;&gt; MAN: Here we go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott sent me an e-mail today... and just said, like, "I'd love to see you." I haven't responded. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Lamar Odom in critical condition this morning... &gt;&gt; REPORTER 2: Odom is in a coma and has not woken up or responded. &gt;&gt; REPORTER 3: Lamar Odom fights for his life at a Las Vegas hospital. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How was the transfer to L.A.? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was like I felt, like, helpless. It was really crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so overwhelmed with what's going on with Lamar. It's heartbreaking... heartbreaking. I don't think I've ever felt so powerless and it makes me really, really sad. First of all, we had to find a helicopter that was big enough for him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause he's so tall. Once they secured that, we took him upstairs, on the roof... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...put him into the helicopter and then I was sitting in the car, waiting to hear... You know, when they took off. And as soon as they went back up into the air... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...I raced to the airport, took off, landed before they did. So I got to Cedars, I met all the doctors-- everyone showed up in the middle of the night. You know, we got him settled and then, um, I went home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna go back this afternoon. See what Khloe needs. Take her some fresh clothes. Hopefully, she'll get her hair washed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I feel, like, relieved that he's here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I do, too. You know? I think that Khloe is less stressed out because she's here and she can be at the hospital every day and maybe still sleep at home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I don't think she was leaving his side. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She would have never left. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, that's what I'm saying, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Yeah. It's better. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe has been spending every second in the hospital with Lamar, by his side, and she feels guilty for needing to leave, even if it's, you know, to take a shower. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right now, they have to stabilize all of his organs. And they want to do another MRI, they want to make sure that the dialysis is under control... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause the strokes are, you know, debilitating and they don't know yet how he's gonna... respond to all of it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I think just him hearing our voices and seeing us and having family around is healthy and might make a difference. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is happening here? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's so exciting. Even though Kim really didn't want a big birthday party because of her being so pregnant and with everything going on with Lamar, Kanye still wanted to celebrate her, so he's throwing this surprise party. He had the whole movie theater transformed. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I want to be pregnant. Where do I put this baby bump? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kanye asked everybody to dress like Kim. I put on a fake baby bump, so that she felt more comfortable, and I think Kim is going to love it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, you should be pregnant, too! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is best idea ever. Are you having twins? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You really look like Kim. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Is he... is he, like, conscious? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's in and out, right now. But he had dialysis for, like, six hours and now that everybody knows where he is, the phone didn't stop ringing, so I'm, like, calling the hospital. "Turn off the phones! Don't put another call through." You know? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And so, um, Khloe hasn't slept in over a week. She... she did not leave his side one time. &gt;&gt; LEAH: She's amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't, I don't even know if she's had a shower yet. She's just not gonna leave. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Does he know that she's there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. He knows. &gt;&gt; LEAH: And what does he... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I looked at him, I said, "Hi." And he goes, "Hi, Ma." &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: The doctor at the last hospital said, "He basically came in here dead." &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, goodness sakes'. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The fact that he's alive is, like, a miracle. A miracle. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mine's gonna have to go like that. That's my only option. Joyce, put this in my back. Does this look good? &gt;&gt; COREY: Now you like... you like a sister. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, they're here. They're here. I just saw their car. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: They're here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's just start singing when she walks in. &gt;&gt; MAN: Here we go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe just do the music... Here they are. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Shh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think Kim has any idea. This was so last-minute that I don't think anybody really had time to ruin the surprise. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, we said, "No, he's having a procedure right now," and... &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe has decided to not go through with her divorce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You gotta talk to Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We also need to change the words. Do you want to just start this now? I wish, like, we could get Kanye to help us. We're big on... &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, they're here. I just saw their car. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: They're here. &gt;&gt; ALL: ♫ Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Kim... ♫ &gt;&gt; COREY: ♫ ...Kimberly... ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I told Kanye, my whole family, I wanted to do nothing for my birthday. We all have so much going on. I never get surprised. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do you like that we're all pregnant? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, you guys are all dressed like me. Especially you. I thought we were just gonna go to the movies, him and I, but he had my friends there and my family and had everyone dress up with a big bump, so I wouldn't feel as big as I do. It was just a really relaxing birthday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at the food. &gt;&gt; COREY: Happy birthday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are we really watching a movie? &gt;&gt; KANYE: What's up? Good seeing you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: How did I do on short notice? This is very black, and it's very Kim. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Yeah, uh, it definitely is a Kim outfit. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What do you feel like is a good age to have kids? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: 30's a good age. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Like, 25. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: 30's a good age. Depends on how many kids you want. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like 30's too late; every psychic said I'm only gonna have two kids. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: When you have one, you might as well have two. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: And you want your kids close together. That's why we had you. Might as well have two so they got somebody to grow up with. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; TYGA: Might as well, why not? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So I'm just... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Uh, somebody for Kendall to grow up with. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm the one to keep Kendall company. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. If I'm gonna get to my 30 grandchildren, you got to have at least three. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Four. &gt;&gt; TYGA: You want 30 grandchildren? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: 30 grandchildren, I think, would be perfect. Eggs in the oven. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 30 grandkids? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Oh, I'm happy to call. I can call as soon as... I'm in the middle of Kim's birthday celebration. No, no, it's okay. We're just at the theater. Well, I-I think that a retainer is reasonable. We want him to have the best attorney if they're gonna try and charge him, but on the other hand, I don't know if that decision's been made, you know, because they came to the hospital room, and they served a search warrant... in the middle of, like, his dialysis treatment. And so, you know, we said, you know, "He's having a procedure right now. You got to talk to Khloe." &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe has decided to not go through with her divorce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And she can probably call somebody in the DA's office in Nevada. &gt;&gt; KIM: She has been by Lamar's side, and Lamar isn't really in a place where he can really make these important decisions, so I think that it's just the best decision for Khloe to make the best medical decisions for Lamar. &gt;&gt; COREY: You want anything else? Uh, hey, I'm talking to you. Talking to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? I'm doing... I'm doing something. What, baby? &gt;&gt; COREY: I know you're doing something, I don't give a what you're doing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; COREY: Do you need anything? Want me to get water first, then deal with the popcorn in a minute? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm good. &gt;&gt; COREY: Was everything all right with the other stuff? From the phone calls? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Checking in. Yeah. Hi. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Looks like everybody's working over here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: That's no fun. &gt;&gt; COREY: Hey, chill out. We-we just drinking and eating popcorn and talking to Ena. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You remember Corey. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; COREY: You want a drink? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: No. &gt;&gt; COREY: No drink? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: No, not really. &gt;&gt; COREY: Eh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a question for you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Remember when you used to have bad knees? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I got one right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know why? 'Cause now you're wearing heels. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, the instructions were to come as Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you bring a pair of, like, UGGs or something? &gt;&gt; COREY: The best you can. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: And she... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, a smart girl always has a pair of UGGs in her car. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I-I understand. It's a lot of work, honey. I guarantee as soon as I hit the car, these shoes will be off. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like everyone to head to theater six, please, which is down the hallway on the right. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna wish to be so skinny soon. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Yes, something meaningful to the world. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do I wish that my baby is so cute? I'll take a bad delivery for an extra-gorgeous baby, I'm not gonna lie. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't say that. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Each tier was a different wish. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so sunny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So remaking Mom's song for the video. You don't want to sing on it, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: We... we have a week. We've all been so stressed, and we were gonna cancel my mom's party, but it's her 60th birthday, and deep down I know Lamar, you know, he would want us to have this party. So we're gonna get back to planning it and just make it a really exciting time. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey, what's up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Kenny. Wait, are you with Mom? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, we're remaking the video from "I love my friends." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, no, I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so we have to record it in a studio. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, sing the song? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you have plans tomorrow night? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. No, I don't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, let's get it all done tomorrow night. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That'll be fun. Studio hoes. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. Like, we are the studio. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We are the studio and the hoes. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, love you, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Love you. Bye. We also need to change the words. Do you want to just start this now? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so "riding down the highway." Um... Then what does it say? "We're big on..." &gt;&gt; KIM: "We're big on..." ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "We're big on..." &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wish, like, we could get Kanye to help us. &gt;&gt; KIM: This video just gives me anxiety. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Riding down the highway with her friends at her side." &gt;&gt; KIM: Or should I say, "With her kids by her side"? And we just make it about us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, they're all coming to the party. There's, like, hundreds of people coming to this party. That's who we're, like, singing to. We're singing it to all the friends at the party, like, "She loves you." ♫ ♫ "She loves you." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I guess. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; COREY: Hey, what's up, baby? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, babe. &gt;&gt; COREY: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; COREY: I know it's the middle of the day, but remember when I came to you about the situation of me worrying about your stress levels and you relaxing and everything? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; COREY: Well, today you've been summoned... by your lovely man torelax. We're taking a one-two punch. A time-out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A one-two punch? That sounds violent. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah, but we punching at love and relaxing. ♫ ♫ So you're going to take a time-out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are we gonna relax? A time-out? &gt;&gt; COREY: Don't worry. Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For how long, babe? Whoopsy. Wait, a time-out for how long? &gt;&gt; COREY: Now, now, it's not... &gt;&gt; KRIS: For how long? &gt;&gt; COREY: Hey, what's more important, your life, your well-being, or whatever the this schedule is talking about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: After everything that's going on with Lamar, Corey has been amazing and supportive. I'm so used to taking care of everybody else. I just didn't know what it felt like for somebody else to take really great care of me. I never want to take that for granted. All right, so where are we going? &gt;&gt; COREY: Don't worry, just bring your little fine ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's my keys? &gt;&gt; COREY: Come on and get in the car; we got to go, we losing sun. I'll carry this for you; I'll carry your other purse for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not helpless. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This picture that I'm posting, in the background, there's, like, a bottle of my breast milk. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How was rehab? &gt;&gt; KIM: It was really good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is it far? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's, like, kind of, like, where, like, Caitlyn's house is. And it's nice, like, he has a really pretty view, and it's, like, a nice place. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think Kourtney is really ready to see Scott at this point. And that's okay, she doesn't have to be. Whatever works for her, she should definitely do. You know, she has to also make herself happy and kind of take care of herself. The kids were, like, so excited to see him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: They went into his room. He wanted to show them his room. The wall had a picture of, like, Reign, Mason and P on there. Mason was, like, so excited to see a picture of himself. Like, "Daddy, that's me!" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it was, like, fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am happy and thankful that Kim took the kids to see Scott. I think it was good for all of them. &gt;&gt; KIM: He seemed great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: And here he was like, "Hey, guys, what's up?" Like, he was, like, so much more excited and into it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just, like, happy about life? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm... He sent me an e-mail today. And just said, "Like, I'd love to see you if you would be into "participating in some of the therapy" or something. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, so I haven't responded, but... I'm really proud of Scott for going to rehab and making an effort to get help. But I'm just not ready to go visit. I hope that after 30 days that he'll feel good and, like, want to stay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We are recording the song for my mom's 60th birthday. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We all sound really good together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who's the Beyoncé, guys? We all know it's me. &gt;&gt; COREY: Babe, how about this? It's not bad for a lunch break, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like this lunch break. &gt;&gt; COREY: All right, here we go with a little cold bubbly for the love of my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks, babe. &gt;&gt; COREY: A toast to great health, love. We got women rubbing, 'cause ain't no man touching you. Imagine people just come in here and they stink from, like, all day, and then y'all have to rub them and, put more oil on top of their stink. &gt;&gt; MASSEUSE: It's happened before. &gt;&gt; COREY: I know it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Typically I would never, ever take any time off in the middle of the day-- especially to go someplace and get a massage-- but I'm really glad I did. Feels really good. &gt;&gt; COREY: So you're relaxed and happy. We're winding down to the end of the year. I know that it's been a rough go for you and-- &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll be kind of excited when it's over. &gt;&gt; COREY: You've been taking care of everybody, being there for everybody, and you've just been so great, but it's only so much you can give before you take all your own away. With this new coming year, I really want you to... focus on yourself sometimes, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: At first, I was a little overwhelmed, but Corey's a great guy and I like spending time with him. Okay, I'll work on that. &gt;&gt; COREY: That's, that's a deal? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Deal. Pinky swear. I realized I need to take the time to spend with the people that I really love and the people that really love me. You take that off? Oh, it's the best part! &gt;&gt; COREY: I don't like the way it looks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, just close your eyes. &gt;&gt; COREY: Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then eat it. &gt;&gt; COREY: I like to see what I like. That's why when I kiss you, you know how my eyes be open? It's because I like what I'm kissing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your eyes aren't always open. &gt;&gt; COREY: Most of the time they are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They are? &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah, my eyes are open when I kiss you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; SCOTT F.: Hello, welcome. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you see the video? &gt;&gt; SCOTT F.: I did, I did, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Of what we're copying, yeah, so you don't just think we're nuts. &gt;&gt; SCOTT F.: 30 years ago-- is that right? Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, yeah, it's crazy. Today we are recording the song for my mom's 60th birthday party, but I cannot wait for my mom to see our video and to see what other surprises we have for her. Get ready, Kenny. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, we made up the new lyrics? Who-who wrote this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and I kind of, like, put it into place. Do you want to sit down and sing with us? Kim's, like, too shy to sing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are we all singing together on the track? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I mean, I'll sing if we, like, all do it together. &gt;&gt; SCOTT F.: Ideally, if you can trade some lines, that be great. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Who else is coming? Is Kylie--? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The only person who's not here is Khloe. What do you think? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe. Do you think we don't even need her to come? We really haven't been telling her what we're doing, because we just want her to be able to focus on Lamar, and not have to worry about anything to do with my mom's party or with this video, because we've got it under control. I just hope that she doesn't get upset. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want me to hold your hand? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. This is so intimidating. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Let me join in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get ready! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, God, I hate hearing myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. I hate hearing myself, too. &gt;&gt; SCOTT F.: All right, so get close to your microphones if you can, that be great. So, um, so since there's four of us now, should we stop from the top there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, there's a couple-- Hold on, it says about turning 60, it says, "She's the last to reach that stop." We're gonna change it to "She's the first to reach that stop." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And then should we master the first part all of us together so we get that, and then we start doing this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, luckily with all of us here, if one stops for a second, it's fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's fine. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Exactly, but you just got to be quiet, so, like, if you can't get it and you need to stop, just, like ba-- Don't laugh, just back off and, like, let it happen. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: By the way, we all sound really good together and should consider this. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We should consider this as a real job. &gt;&gt; KIM: Fourth Harmony. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, we get Khloe. We need Khloe, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel so bad for Khloe. I mean, she was so excited about this song. What if we were a group? And what if it was, like, a group of five really super average singers? Like, you know how there's usually one really, one that sings so good, but we're just, like, all really bad singers? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We sound good together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, who's the Beyoncé, guys? We all know it's me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like you think think it's you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She enjoys it the most. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe's the deep, down and dirty voice. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe has just been trying to be at the hospital as much as she can. And this song, you know, is so minimal compared to what she's going through, but I know she's, like, having a major case of FOMO. &gt;&gt; ALL: She loves you guys! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're so good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, does Kourtney want to sing a solo? 'Cause it seems like that's what she wants to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but I'm saying is this even gonna sound good? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, it's gonna sound good. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It also doesn't need to sound like real singers. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's so funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should we have done that one part one more time? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are we gonna listen to it or something? &gt;&gt; SCOTT F.: Sure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think we should. &gt;&gt; SCOTT F.: Here it comes. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We sound horrendous altogether. I think Kim and I have really similar voices. And Kendall and Kylie, theirs are just, like, deeper than ours. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'll walk out with you, because I got to go, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. It-- We're not like a harmony, like, singing group. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye, thank you! &gt;&gt; SCOTT F.: All right, want to check it out from...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It sounds so much better when you and I are singing it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT F.: Here we go. &gt;&gt; KIM: So let's just do the whole thing just you and me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I swear to God we need to, I'm telling you. That's what I was telling you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ours is, like, a hundred times better. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what I told you! That's why! &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's re-sing it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think there's no option. Kim and I have to re-record this song, because it just sounds awful. And don't tell anyone. &gt;&gt; KIM: I almost feel bad, but, like, Khloe won't have to feel guilty. She's not the only one that isn't a part of this song. We didn't even need them here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We could've had Kendall and Kylie do one verse together, because I bet their voices sound more alike. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, because then the whole song is gonna be like, And then 'Cause they really have manly voices. Crazy. Who knew? On the next episode... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This looks insane! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Happy birthday! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Incredible! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom has never had a party be all about her. This is my first time having alcohol in four weeks. KrisJenner. You're about to get your panties moist, girl. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just, like, don't know what to do about T. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: She's working at Victoria's Secret. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The attention is not gonna be on you for one second. You can't come!
