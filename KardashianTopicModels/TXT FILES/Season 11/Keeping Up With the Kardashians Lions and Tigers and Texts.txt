- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; DJ: Kylie, happy birthday! Everybody make some noise for Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: For sure, one of the best nights of my life so far. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What happened with these divorce papers on Friday? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I told Laura, "Let's tell the judge we need to speed this along. I'm not gonna do this forever." I think filing for the divorce is the worst thing in the world. I feel like you're hurting everybody, but I need to do what I feel is best. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: It is so hot in this house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think it's your hormones. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Wait, could I talk to you about something? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, kind of serious? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I just went to lunch, because we were celebrating Sheila's birthday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I went like this, and I pulled out these tampons. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And they were all flabbergasted. They go, "Why do you have tampons in your purse?" And I go, "'Cause I was on my period." And they said, "How the hell could you be on your period?" I said, "Well, because hormone cream." Celeste is like, "Are you on birth control?" And I go, "Birth control? Why in the world, at 60 years old, would I be on birth control?" And she said, "Because you can still get pregnant." I don't think I could get pregnant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, you'd have to ask your doctor. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I am pregnant, I don't know what I would do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just call your doctor. I'm gonna go feed Reign. I'll be back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I'll gonna call Paul Crane. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Paul, it's Kris Jenner. I have a quick question for you. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I started having my period because of the estrogen cream that I'm taking. My question is this. Is there any way that I could get pregnant? &gt;&gt; PAUL: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's good news. Do you make eggs? Would I be making any kind of eggs? &gt;&gt; PAUL: Nope, nope. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scrambled? Fried? Poached? &gt;&gt; PAUL: No, you're okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Never thought I'd be so happy to get a negative, no, you can't get pregnant. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I was loving it that everyone was saying I was faking this pregnancy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause you were skinny. &gt;&gt; KIM: My body is starting to get so big again. I feel-- you know what I feel like? I feel like I'm Buddy Love, and I'm turning into Professor Klump. Like, I look at my hand, and it's like, bloop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love Buddy Love. &gt;&gt; KIM: And it, like, just starts, like, getting big, and then I look at my feet, and it's like, bloop, bloop. I feel like every part of my body is just, like, exploding. So, um, how are you doing and how is everything? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you mean? Like, with Lamar? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. The whole thing just sucks. Like, whatever. There's nothing you can do. I finally decided to move everything forward with the divorce. There's way more underlying issues than if we love each other. That's never been a question, but there's real life that comes in between love sometimes, and as horrible as that sounds, it's true. It's just like, a weird thing to, like, understand, like, so much of, like, that one chapter that was such a huge part of my life is just, like, closed. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I feel like you finally are done. You're way closer to being over it, where before I thought you were so into it. And I was like, "Oh, God." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because you mistaken-- you mistake my kindness for me going back with someone. You don't marry someone, and then you can cut them out of your life that easily. I care about Lamar, so I want the best for him. I just want the best for his wellbeing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But when it starts to become toxic on my current life, then that's when I have to remove myself. I've let our divorce be dormant for quite some time now. Trying to give Lamar time to make an effort. He can't commit to making us better, so I have to now step away, and I have to do what's best for me, and I can still love him, but I have to love and let go, I guess. Anyway... You know? It's just dumb. ♫ ♫ Hey. &gt;&gt; COREY: What's up, Khlo? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so pretty out here. &gt;&gt; COREY: It is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Neverdone. &gt;&gt; COREY: How is this place not done? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All my landscaping I want to get done. I'm supposed to redo my whole barbeque area. &gt;&gt; COREY: This house is so perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. Kendall and I follow this Instagram account called blackjaguarwhitetiger, and it's about this guy who's just, like, this really wealthy guy. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know of him? &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah, dope, dope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And he just rescues, like, mainly exotic cats. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How'd you guys find out about this guy? &gt;&gt; COREY: He got a movement. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He has, like, three million followers. &gt;&gt; COREY: He's got a serious movement, and what he do for the animals is amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He rescues them from, like, circuses or people who buy these animals for, like, pets and then they get too big, and they don't know what to do with them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where does he live? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In Mexico. Kendall and I reached out to go there. Like, he would love for us to go and, like, bring awareness to his place, 'cause it's only gonna add, hopefully, people to give him more donations or whatever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He just rescues them to take care of them, and it's just wild. Just with everything that's happening, it's, like, a good time for me to get away, and Kendall is always just, like, good energy to be around. I just don't want to be here. Just, like, too much drama in the LBC. Right now, there is so much going on in my life that I just want to get away. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, so you're gonna go to Mexico and visit this guy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I just like people that like to do, like, good things for others. He gained followers fast. &gt;&gt; COREY: Fast. I mean,, I've been following the guy since he had 1,000 followers, so I might need to jump on that trip. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you could come. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, so you just jumped on their bandwagon? &gt;&gt; COREY: I'm already halfway. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, they say that it's really therapeutic to do something around animals for people that are stressed. I don't think they were referring to lion, tiger and bear situation, exactly, but whatever floats your boat. &gt;&gt; COREY: I want to play with the big jaguar. He has this big jaguar, and a jaguar can crush your skull. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are living on the edge. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You wouldn't want to go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have so much going on. I mean, when are you going? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, soon. I don't like to give too much information. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; COREY: So, she basically saying, "You either in or you're motherout." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I think I'm motherout. &gt;&gt; COREY: Well, whatever they say. I'm just following the bandwagon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys have fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks, Mom. &gt;&gt; COREY: Uh-oh. Mama's leaving. You should have saw the dog jump, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Gooberstein. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, are you putting your dirty feet on my new white couch? &gt;&gt; KIM: My feet are so clean. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, they're actually... You just walked through the dirty backyard. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Your dirty backyard? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you know, it's dusty. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is a pregnant woman you're talking to. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like she's been pregnant longer than I was pregnant. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't worry. Soak it in. It'll never happen again. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is it, one-hundo. One of each, and I'm good. Wait, so Kylie is, like, hosting parties for her birthday? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not my favorite thing that she does. First of all... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...she has to go to Europe or Canada; another country. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I just don't think, you know, she needs to be doing that. I don't need her to run into a bunch of problems in clubs. Now that Kylie's 18, this will be her first personal appearance in a place where the drinking age is 18, which means that she may not be drinking because she's not a big drinker, but the crowds might get a little more, you know, intense. And so, yeah, I'm very anxious and nervous and worried about my baby girl. I just don't want her to grow up too fast. &gt;&gt; COREY: But she's looking at it as this-- she's doing something fun and it's her hustle; she's practicing her hustle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want to keep her in check. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, totally. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a fast world. It's a lot faster than it was when Kim was doing it, even. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, she's definitely about a decade too soon. Like, I was doing it at 28. What is she gonna be doing when she's 30? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I feel like she's gonna have kids at, like, 22. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, really? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I swear-- she's, like, in such fast-forward that, like, I feel like everything's gonna get so boring-- &gt;&gt; COREY: She's already 26. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had my first baby at 22. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: But those were the old days. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now I'm even more anxious and freaked out, so I don't want to be that overbearing mom, but I'm gonna have to say something to Kylie. &gt;&gt; COREY: Has anybody ever walked through there with you? &gt;&gt; MAN: You want to come? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll do it! I just feel like why not? I've always wanted to run with the animals. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. There are so many people here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Isn't it crazy that I learned Spanish for ten years in school and I don't know anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really? I understand a lot. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are we three hours ahead or two? Dos. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good job! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thanks. Muy bien. I am so excited to go to The Black Jaguar-White Tiger organization. I'm so happy to get away. I think Mexico's gonna be a good distraction with everything that's going on in my life. Isn't it annoying that Mom didn't come? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't if she, she doesn't really like animals. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, my mom hates animals. &gt;&gt; COREY: She's scared of the, she's scared of the cats. I don't know, I think, hey, she just probably having some "me time" anyway. And I'm gonna get some time with y'all, the babies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't feel weird? &gt;&gt; COREY: Feel weird? Uh, what are y'all-- creatures? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; COREY: I don't feel weird. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We took you here to kill you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is nice. I have to get on the Wi-Fi stat. Code for the Wi-Fi! Food! That's the way it goes. &gt;&gt; COREY: So, what's up, Miss Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nothing. &gt;&gt; COREY: It's your first time really getting to hang-hang with me. You got some questions for me? Got anything you want to know? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do I have questions for you? &gt;&gt; COREY: Yes, I'm sitting on your brain. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; COREY: I tend to pay more attention to you and Kylie. I-I think about y'all the most. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Really? &gt;&gt; COREY: 'Cause y'all are babies, yeah. It's my way of seeing about you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie and I are, like, pretty chill for, like, the younger ones. 'Cause I feel like the younger ones usually get really defensive and, like, protective. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But... &gt;&gt; COREY: Y'all do so much, so y'all out on your own and I always just, always want to make sure y'all safe. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; COREY: So, you want to talk about anything, you want to ask, feel free. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Of course. &gt;&gt; COREY: Open book. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Same. Since I'm always traveling, I feel like I haven't gotten to know Corey very well, but he seems very sweet. I mean, there's just definitely a big age gap between him and my mom, so I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Kendall, that's not how you open it! Oh, my-- &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's not gonna do much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look what my friend Alessandro sent me from Hermès. He also sent you a present. &gt;&gt; KIM: He did, really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Baby gift? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: You could've rewrapped it and re-gifted it and pretend like you gave it to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Aw! Oh, it says Baby West. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I love this. I didn't know it had a zebra on it. &gt;&gt; KIM: A zebra. That's so nice, seriously. So we should call him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's see. Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Lamar, he tried to FaceTime me this morning really early. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lamar? Why are you talking to Lamar? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, usually he just texts with me. But I guess he tried to FaceTime me this morning. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe finally realized you cannot change a person. You have to move on. And even though we all love Lamar, I feel like now my mom just kind of set everything back. And now two years later, he wants to reach out? I mean, Khloe was so upset when she left Nobu. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, There he is again. I know you get excited about doing some of these appearances and I worry a little bit. Kylie is finally 18, and with that comes a lot of added responsibility. I always worried about her, especially now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe, don't run. Maybe you should just come back, sister. I'm freaking out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe was so upset when she left Nobu. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, There he is again. &gt;&gt; KIM: So why are you, like, engaging? You don't have to respond right away. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, now that I know exactly how she feels and what she's gone through a little bit more and all this stuff she didn't tell me, she's starting to tell me, so it makes more sense and now I understand. But at the same time, somebody reaches out to me-- &gt;&gt; KIM: But if your child says... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...don't do this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, I get it now. I didn't understand it as much, because I considered him, like, one of my own. And then he tries to reach out to me and I-- Just like I would never not respond to one of you guys, it's just not in me not to respond to somebody that I love. And it literally breaks my heart that it didn't work out. And I know it breaks hers. So it's just been a process. &gt;&gt; KIM: She just, she's ready to get over him and you need to let that happen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: If she keeps on hearing about him from you, it's gonna take longer and she's gonna get sucked back in and she just doesn't need to be in that space. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I got it. &gt;&gt; KIM: But "do you" is the question. Do you really got it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I do. You can take those downstairs if you want. Where should, where should I put this tray? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. You have so many accessories in this house. I would put it in the garage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Never gonna happen. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh! This looks nice. Kylie? Hello. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! You look cute. The house looks great. I especially like the dirty underwear on the floor right there. Those are awesome. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You have really light hair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I did the highlights today. Do you like it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm trying to be like you. 18 years old again, baby. Um, speaking of 18, I know that you get excited about doing some of these appearances and I worry a little bit. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm about to do my first club appearance, for my birthday, in Canada, and my mom just won't stop checking up on me about it. But I'm grown now. I'm 18, I can handle this on my own. I was asked to do this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. And I think it's a great experience, but I just want you to be on your best behavior and watch your Ps and Qs. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Totally. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's, uh... drinking age is 18 in Canada, right? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yep. I wasn't planning on drinking, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Kylie is finally 18 and with that comes a lot of added responsibility, especially when there's alcohol involved. So I always worried about her, especially now. I'm just being your mom and saying... be on your best behavior, missy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Totally. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. And you have these two little babies! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh! Jumpy! Okay. ♫ ♫ Look at him, he's just so cute. Don't try to take my hands off of you, 'cause you can't fly. 'Member? You can't fly! &gt;&gt; KIM: He looks like a little old man. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ♫ A little old man. ♫ He looks like... if P and him were identical twins, like, boy-girl twins... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...he looks like the other half of P. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, boy-girl twin can't be identical, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. Got it. So, um, what are we gonna do about, um, St. Barts? You said that you looked up a cool house that you had? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So where is it? I want to see it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me grab my computer. It's through a company called Sibarth Villa Rentals. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's it called? La... Banana? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Banan? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Banane? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Banane? La Banan? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, look at that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hold on. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's so much going on in the family right now, so I decided it's, like, the perfect time for our family vacation. I think we all need it. This is Kourtney's first trip without Scott and, like, Kendall and Kylie, it would be great for them to spend time together. So I think this is just exactly what we need. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So it has enough room for all of us? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, and that's what we need. I just feel like the point is to all stay together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I'm in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I think we should just do all girls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So that means no Corey? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And kids. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can't bring Corey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can make it all girls. It'll be fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! Yeah! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my stomach is killing me again. Ooh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We haven't even been here for one night, really. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. I am not coming here to not see tigers and I'm not coming here, like, to get on a plane sick. I will kill everyone. Just so we all know the wrath of... I'll throw up on every person here. On purpose. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: When Khloe gets stressed out, she physically gets sick, so I'm worried that maybe this throwing up is, like, anxiety. I'm hoping that being able to spend time with the tigers and the lions and the jaguars and stuff will make her happier. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What else could it be? What was yesterday? Wednesday? Forgot to take birth control. &gt;&gt; COREY: Good morning. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you sick, too? &gt;&gt; COREY: Nah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe's, like, throwing up. &gt;&gt; COREY: Not my poor baby! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; COREY: Sorry you're feeling bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it's so annoying. Thank you. &gt;&gt; COREY: Hey... maybe I'm gonna have another grandkid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Absolutely not. Mm-mm. Oh, &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Squad out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Squad out. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khlo... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; COREY: What's up, man? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: How are you? Welcome. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good. I'm Kendall. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Eddie. Pleasure meeting you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, I'm Khloe. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Pleasure meeting you. &gt;&gt; COREY: What up, man? Corey. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: How are you? &gt;&gt; COREY: How you doing? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Nice meeting you. Shall we go in? &gt;&gt; ALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; COREY: I'm so happy to be here, man. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Yeah, you're gonna love it, trust me. &gt;&gt; COREY: You know, I haven't paid this much attention to nothing since Michael Jackson. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. Oh, my God... Khlo... Hi, guys... &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Yeah, that's a good thing... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is insane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: That's Hector. We have Maverick, Ismond... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Look how they are! They're holding it down. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How long do you have them for? Do you have them their whole lives? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: All their lives. Yeah, all their lives. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Like, uh... this is stage one, where we are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Then we have, like, 60 acres. We'll move them in, like, two months. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How do you find them? Do people, like, come to you? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Yeah, absolutely. Like, two days ago, actually, we just got an e-mail about this lovely couple that made a mistake of getting a tiger as a... as a pet. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh. Okay. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: And now, three months later, she was destroying their house. They made that mistake. But that's how we get most of the kids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you don't, like, get mad at them or whatever. Like, people feel safe... &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Look, if you get mad at someone, they won't listen to you. If I yell at them, start reprimanding them, then that won't help anyone, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People have taken these wild cats to be house cats or circus animals and that's tragic. These animals belong in the wild. Hi, baby. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I told you they like me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; COREY: They like the women. They feel what she's going through. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She doesn't feel well. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But the lions make me happier. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Yeah, I'm surrounded by love all day long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's awesome. What's so awesome about Eddie is that even though these animals are so scarred and damaged when Eddie gets them, all he wants to do is give them love and care. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: So let's start heading out. Now, let me go first. Come on, come out. Stay over here, on this side. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it comes from such a pure love. And he instills that back into these animals and... and the animals just feel that. It's really incredible. Can I touch one of them? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Yeah, come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw... Hello. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Randy, hi... &gt;&gt; KHLOE AND KENDALL: Aw... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop it. The cutest ever. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Best thing is if you just come and pick him up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, Kendall. &gt;&gt; MAN: There you go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Pretty. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Just keep your face away from me. It's my money-maker, here. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: This is the quarantine areas, where we put their immunizations, we deworm them... They have to be over there, by law, 40 days. Cielo! So she's my first rescue. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; COREY: So beautiful... &gt;&gt; EDDIE: She's my first rescue. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I cannot believe he is in there with a panther. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Oh, she's the nicest one. I knew a guy that had her and wanted to sell her to a pet store, to have people take pictures with her. So I convinced him to give her to me. &gt;&gt; COREY: She's so pretty. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Want to go in? He's not gonna do anything, but of course, he's heavy. &gt;&gt; MAN: Go past, go ahead. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you sure we're good? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: It's fine. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Just relax. &gt;&gt; MAN: That's a leopard. Yeah, he is, he's like a dog in that sense. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: He's super nice. Of course, he can kill you in ten seconds. But he's, like, the nicest being on the planet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my gosh! Kendall, take a picture. It's absolutely insane. I'm literally petting a leopard. He's so sweet. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Don't worry, he's gonna go through your leg... your legs, he loves doing that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're exotic and beautiful, and they're loving, and I just like how therapeutic they are. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Uh, I'll show you the big ones. &gt;&gt; COREY: Khloe, Kendall, watch out for your leg. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're scared, aren't you? &gt;&gt; COREY: No, I'm not scared. I just... I got my little boundaries. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: I promise you they won't do anything to you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Look at that one just laying on its back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at this lion. Hi. Look how beautiful this mane is. &gt;&gt; MAN: Here he goes, see? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Hello, papa. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was awesome. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: We-we rescued him from a circus. They were selling his-his fangs for $700. And his skin for $10,000. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But it's insane, like, you can literally see how he wants to kill you in his eyes. He would kill us. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: In one second. &gt;&gt; COREY: What about this one? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Well, we just got them two weeks ago. We rescued 63 from a circus... &gt;&gt; COREY: Which one is this? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: That's Kira. &gt;&gt; COREY: Has anybody ever walked through there with you? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: I will make an exception if you want to come in. Do you want to come? &gt;&gt; COREY: Nah, that's okay. That's okay. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Very sleepy. &gt;&gt; COREY: Except for that leopard. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: But the leopard doesn't do anything. &gt;&gt; MAN: Feel his pulse, he's getting nervous. &gt;&gt; COREY: Nah, nah, my heart not beating, I'm not... I'm just thinking, man, I done lived a good life. ♫ ♫ I got a woman at home I love. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like in the past, I've been afraid of some things or afraid to do things. I'll do it. I'll do it, yeah. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: You-you want to do it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just hold this. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sometimes you just got to do what you want to do. And I've always wanted to run with the animals. So I just feel like, "Why not?" You only live once. If I die, I die with pride. &gt;&gt; MAN: Take it easy. &gt;&gt; COREY: Hold up. I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, sister, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you, Kenny. See you later. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Come over here and walk over there. Yeah. Close. And let's walk over here. No, no, no, no, get in. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe, don't run. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Uh-uh-uh! Uh-uh-uh! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is this a good idea? Should we get her back in? &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Uh! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe is very scared. I can see it in her mannerisms that she's trying to be calm, 'cause if she freaks out, they're gonna attack her. Maybe you should just come back, sister. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: This one's sweet. This one's sweet. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm freaking out. And I'm on the verge of tears. I think my sister's about to die. She should come back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is a messed up situation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe just not make such a big deal out of it and let it go. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're insane, Mom. This is a really big deal. You're insane. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just can't take it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What do you and my mom even do together? &gt;&gt; COREY: Your mom got a lot of energy. Think we do more than you younger girls do. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Uh-uh-uh! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Maybe you should just come back, sister. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: This one's sweet. This one's sweet. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She should come back. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Not yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like I've been getting more brave and strong recently. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey, maybe we should just bring her back in. &gt;&gt; EDDIE: Hold on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In the past, I've been more afraid to do things and how it will affect other people, and I love exotic cats, and I feel very safe with Eduardo. What a blessing that I get the opportunity to be with him. &gt;&gt; MAN: Way to be looking-- a tiger, lions, you did it, hey. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Oh, my God, I clap for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; MAN 3: I am impressed. Good job. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Only when the leopard... I was like, "Ah, the leopard's gonna ... it up for us all." &gt;&gt; MAN 4: Yeah, he did that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guys, this was, like, the best experience seriously ever. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, thank you guys so much for letting us come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's, like, the best experience of our l... Like, we'll never forget this. Ever. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's insane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This trip is exactly what I needed. I feel really proud of myself for going in with lions and jaguars and panthers. And animals are definitely therapeutic. I think I'm one with the animals, and I think they feel my love. &gt;&gt; COREY: That was cool, man. Like, that was cool as hell. That was real cool. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Six Flags Mexico?! Why don't we go?! Corey, I'm happy you came even though my mom didn't come. &gt;&gt; COREY: I like spending time with y'all. I'm happy I came too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, so tell us a little something about yourself. &gt;&gt; COREY: As far as what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just want to get to know you more. So... where did you grow up? &gt;&gt; COREY: Atlanta, Georgia. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What exactly do you do for a living? &gt;&gt; COREY: It's not about a title, just basically making happen in the music industry. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What do you and my mom even do together? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What, like, hanging out? &gt;&gt; COREY: We-we do everything. I mean, your mom got a lot of energy. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So how much time do you spend together? 'Cause I'm not around anymore. I don't live at that house. &gt;&gt; COREY: We spend a lot of time together. Enough. I mean... I don't know. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm just asking 'cause my dad was always away, so, like, they... I don't know. So I don't know the dynamic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They go to art shows. They go to dinners a lot. So they're both into art. &gt;&gt; COREY: Y-Yeah, we do, like, the art thing. We do... you know, she likes to do her-her shopping deal. I feel like being with your mom is better than being with any chick my age or-or younger. ♫ ♫ Think we do more than you younger girls do. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I genuinely think Corey cares about my mom and loves her. My mom has been through a lot, and to see someone taking care of her and really giving her everything she needs is really great. This ended up being a really nice trip. I'm glad that I got to spend time with Khloe and got to know Corey a little more, and all is well. &gt;&gt; COREY: We have more fun than you and your guy and Kylie with her guy-life, I promise. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So where do we land? &gt;&gt; MAN: At the beach on the island. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Like, at the party? It's only, like, a five-minute thing? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Uh, no, it's a little... it'll probably be 20 minutes. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What?! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Okay, so now we're getting in kayaks. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. There are so many people here. ♫ ♫ My mom overreacts sometimes, but now I know that my mom wasn't over exaggerating. This crowd is definitely rowdier than I expected. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's call Mom. That's who I should call. For my mom to give out my phone number just infuriates me, and it hurts me so badly. This whole thing shouldn't ever be happening. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, this is all her fault. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This crowd is crazier than I expected. I have done so many appearances, but no one's really drinking at my book signings. I'm about to faint. This is so uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; MAN: I know, it was so hot. I'm-I'm sweating. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'll do a few interviews and ... in this... &gt;&gt; MAN: And then you'll come back here... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And change. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kylie, you look so good. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: So what does it feel like to be an adult in Canada? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I didn't think... I didn't think it would feel any different, but now everyone is like, "Do you want a drink?" Like, legally, and I'm like, "This is so weird." &gt;&gt; REPORTER 2: Are you still gonna be considered the baby? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm definitely gonna still be considered as the baby. My dad had a whole talk with me. He was like, "You're still the youngest. You're always gonna be the youngest. I don't care." So... I've-I've accepted it. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Let's get ready! You guys ready...? &gt;&gt; EMCEE: We are here to celebrate the 18th birthday of Miss Kylie Jenner! Can we get a Kylie chant? : Kylie! Kylie! &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Kylie! Kylie! Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you, Montreal! I throw them out? I've never been to anything where I'm throwing T-shirts at people, but I guess T-shirts are soft, so I think it's fine. Everyone's a bit crazy, but it's fun. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: All right, guys, happy birthday to Kylie-- are you ready? &gt;&gt; CROWD: Happy birthday! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I am so happy that this appearance went well. I appreciate my mom for being overprotective, but I feel like I have been raised well enough that I know how to handle situations like this. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I love you, Kylie! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Anyone want to go to Bible study tonight? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to go to Bible study? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. Wait, I'm trying to listen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the craziest thing. You and my mom are in cahoots together. I'm not into this. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, Khloe changed her number to have a clean start. And she gets a call from Lamar and she doesn't really know how he even got her number. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you joking? What does that even mean? For the past two years, if I need to reach Lamar, I can't, but he could always reach me if he needs something. I kept telling him I need to move on with the divorce. What do you want to do? And then it was public. Then he started calling me, but only at all hours of the night. It's always a one-sided relationship. Mm, I mean, what should we do? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you still on the phone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, 'cause Mom, she has the text messages from him-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, let's call Mom. That's who I should call. Mom, I need to talk to you. Lamar called me on my new number. How did he get my phone number? If you weren't talking to him or anything, we wouldn't have this to talk about today. Like, I was removed from this whole situation. I don't give a ... you psycho! For my mom to give out my phone number just infuriates me and it hurts my feelings. I mean, I love that love that she has for him. And I wouldn't want to change that for anything in the world. But sometimes you got to keep relationships separate. This whole thing shouldn't ever be happening! &gt;&gt; KIM: But it's none of her business. The fact that you're even getting involved with, like, your kid's drama and secretly talking to Lamar is, like, insanity. Like, insanity. She should feel like a piece of ... like this is all her fault. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what? You want to stay mad at Caitlyn? I protected you and I've defended you. You and I need a major break from each other. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys go on this vacation. I-I don't, I am just gonna stay home and I, I just can't take it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's so bizarre. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Anybody want a Starbucks from 7:00 a.m.? You could probably get typhus or something from this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe's on the phone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is a ... messed-up situation. You should tell your mother. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, she's standing right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just don't even know how it came down to this place. I'm just so, I'm just so upset right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe just not make such a big deal out of it and let it go. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're insane, Mom. This is a really big deal. You're insane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks, Mom, for being great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, she thinks she did nothing wrong. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, come on, Mom. Just take accountability and just say sorry one time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know that Lamar and Khloe have had their problems. He's had so many issues that he's been dealing with. But I also feel like he needs us. Lamar doesn't have a lot of extended family, so when he reaches out, I'm going to respond. That's that my heart tells me to do. &gt;&gt; KIM: For some reason, you would think you would know these things, but you make the worst decisions. Tell me one reason why they should even communicate after she's finally had the balls to divorce him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She doesn't tell me all the information. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom... I don't have all the information. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She doesn't tell me all the other stuff that's going on. &gt;&gt; KIM: You sound so stupid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, then I'm stupid! &gt;&gt; KIM: You are the one that communicated with him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what? You want to stay mad at Caitlyn? I, the first thing I did, I was on your side and I protected you and I've defended you-- &gt;&gt; KIM: We all defend you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never asked a ... question, and that was my dad of 23 years, you crazy ... and now this? You know what, you and I need a major break from each other, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think we need to be separated. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. You know what? You guys go on this vacation. I-I don't, I am just gonna stay home and I, I just can't take it. &gt;&gt; KIM: We all love Lamar. And truly, Khloe has done everything in her power to try and save this relationship. She stuck with this for years. I feel like now that she's finally moved on, my mom just kind of set everything back by giving Lamar her number and not taking responsibility. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you guys better fix your own problems. This isn't my problem! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never asked her to be involved in this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, no one's asking you to be involved in this! We're asking you to stop being involved! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. What are you doing? It's been really exciting over here. &gt;&gt; COREY: So, what's up with today? You want to talk to me about today? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's been the worst day ever. Kim and I are in the biggest fight. Kim's yelling at me like I'm an idiot. She's calling me, "You're so stupid." It's so disrespectful. Like, what kind of ... sensitivity chip is Kim missing? Stop getting into everybody else's business. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah, but, babe, you know, you-- &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's doing the same thing she says I'm doing. So I'm going along as-- obviously my family I'm more loyal to than anybody in the universe. &gt;&gt; COREY: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And they're thinking I'm on Lamar's side and I'm taking his side and this is all my fault for what's going on... Because everybody is so heated and so upset, I am the easiest person to blame for the entire incident. So now everybody's yelling at me, treating me with such disrespect, which is bizarre, you know. And I'm, I won't put up with it anymore. I don't want to be around that negative energy. My kids are my first priority. I think I've proven that for the last, I don't know, 36 years. &gt;&gt; COREY: That's why they take up for you so hard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, when you feel like you're doing the best you can and everybody comes down with an iron fist... it hurts. Like, these kids are screaming at me because I should know better. And all I'm trying to do is love everybody and make sure everybody's taken care of and-- &gt;&gt; COREY: But even though, you know, with loving everybody still comes with boundaries with the big kids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm always, like, asked to smooth things over and then when I do, I catch nothing but hell. &gt;&gt; COREY: And we both know, you know, sometimes you have good intentions and the situation will still backfire in your face. Now you just know you got let them hear how they want to hear. They X-ing people out of they life, they got to be X-ed out of yours, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I get that now. I would give anybody that I love the benefit of the doubt. And maybe that's my downfall. Maybe because I forgive everyone-- I give everybody 15 chances-- &gt;&gt; COREY: Cut 15 down to, like, negative one or something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, that's just what I'm about. &gt;&gt; COREY: But I understand what you're saying, I understand. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is second chances and believing in people and listening and not just assuming-- &gt;&gt; COREY: And just stop talking about this, 'cause you've already been through it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't, you're right. I'm done. &gt;&gt; COREY: And-and you had good intentions, so address the things you, if you want to apologize, do it. If not, not. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... All we were looking for is for you to say ... I ... up! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom said, "Get her out of my house." &gt;&gt; KIM: Write her back and say, "Kim will gladly move out." St. Barts is so beautiful. I've always wanted to come here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Who's that?! I am so excited to see Tyga. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was, like, specifically a girls trip and we had said that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I feel like Kylie's really attached. She doesn't leave his side.
