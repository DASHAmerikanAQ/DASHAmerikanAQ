- Previously on Keeping Up With the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I got the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Maybe you should come. To have my whole family sitting there-- it's a media frenzy. I'm just trying to be professional and not have to worry about anything else. No! You can't. You can't come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall is pissed. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I've already been disinvited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going to therapy today with Scott, at the rehab place. I hate doing that kind of stuff. I know nothing's gonna change overnight, but who knows what next week will bring? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Happy birthday! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Incredible! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's improving little by little, and that's all that matters. I have been asked about Lamar 40 times. It's hard; it's tough. I feel like I need a glass of champagne. Shut theup! Uncle Charlie, come here. You're about to get your panties moist, girl. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Alexa, who is Kourtney Kardashian? &gt;&gt; ALEXA: Kourtney Mary Kardashian is an American television personality... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh! &gt;&gt; ALEXA: ...fashion designer and model. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, Two snaps! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Vroom! &gt;&gt; KIM: Alexa, what do you do when your water breaks? &gt;&gt; ALEXA: I didn't understand the question I heard. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, then, you're dumb. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Bitch! &gt;&gt; KIM: Alexia, how far away is Cedars-Sinai from here? &gt;&gt; ALEXA: 63.5 miles away on N. Robertson Boulevard. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I used to hear stories all the time, like, people couldn't make it, so they'd give birth on the front lawn of, like, some random person's house. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, I've heard all those stories, too. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, we have to time it. Or she's gonna give birth in the car. All right, let's go! We kind of got to be in a rush, that's how it's gotta be. Yeah, I know, let's go. &gt;&gt; KIM: We gotta go. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We don't have time to chill like this, you see? It's got tohappen. Let's do this. Come on, Kim! You're dripping! &gt;&gt; KIM: Shut up. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: The water's about to go. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't even begin to explain the anxiety that you have when you just don't know when you're going to go into labor. They always say your second baby comes quicker, so I just... I hope I make it there in time. So I just want to time it out, like, from Calabasas to the hospital. The unknown just scares me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoa! Guys... &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't drive that fast. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Slip and slide all over here. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Don't worry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The hospital timing. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We're here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna get the camera... So... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So that took 55... 56 minus 12. Hold on. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: 56 minus 12 is 44. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's about what I thought. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: 44 minutes from start to finish. That's better than I expected. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sonauseous. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Don't say it's 'cause of me. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is. No, it is. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: I've never gotten carsick, ever. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I am the best driver, are you kidding? ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. That was the best night ever. Who came back here with you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was by myself. : Jen and Mike put me in a car and sent me home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We went to The Chateau. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, me, Kim, Kanye, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you kidding? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kanye played us all of his new songs. &gt;&gt; JEN: My favorite part was Khloe kicking Charlie Wilson off the stage, 'cause she was over this &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, Kanye said I was a great emcee and... that's a compliment. I definitely don't remember a good 80% of my mom's birthday. I do know I looked really good in my dress. You've got to stop posting these videos I don't remember. I needed to blow off some steam and I just don't feel guilty about getting thatup, because I deserved every glass of champagne. &gt;&gt; JEN: You were grabbing everyone's boobs and hitting everyone in the dick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you kidding? I remember hitting everyone in the dick. &gt;&gt; JEN: She hit Mike, like, three times in the dick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But then I would say... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did youhim off after? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did. But then I would... I would pretend to hit him and I'd go, "Gotcha that time, Mike!" Like, I would do it every time. So he never knew. &gt;&gt; JEN: That was wild. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have to shut this The hearing me saying I hit people in the dick. I'm, like, getting nervous all of a sudden. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want me to pre-interview them about what you're gonna be... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Apparently, I did one. It's just, like... so serious, everything. I have cancelled a ton of my book tour because I just don't feel comfortable leaving L.A. at the moment, because of Lamar's health. But I am doing an interview for and I'm very blessed that they are coming to my home. &gt;&gt; JEN: Did they give you the questions beforehand or no? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but I could guess. I know everyone is curious and wanting to have answers to everything, but the situation right now is incredibly fragile and... it goes up and down so quickly and every day is different. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, why don't you say, "Can we, like, not be so serious?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what you want me to say? "Can we, like, not be so serious?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want me to run in the background in my robe? To liven things up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I don't like that robe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll go borrow one of yours. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, can you change? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Just like that. Might have you scooch in later. Okay. &gt;&gt; NATALIE: Love the cookie display. I would be crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have them all the time, so they're not tempting to me. &gt;&gt; NATALIE: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But if I go to someone else's house with, like, new treats, I get excited. &gt;&gt; NATALIE: Yeah. Yeah, all right. We ready, guys? &gt;&gt; MAN: Um... yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Good. &gt;&gt; NATALIE: Khloe, there are lots of diet, self-help, nutrition books on the market already, written by celebrities. Why did you think your transformation and writing about it was something that your fans would want to know about? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For me, it was really about just telling people that it's not about one size fits all. It's about being, I think, starting with being happy from within. This is a platform where, even if I could help better five people, then that's what I think I should be doing. &gt;&gt; NATALIE: Um, moving on to the crisis with Lamar recently... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. There's so many things going through my head, and I am also nervous, which... I'm not used to nerves. I have to think, like, what would Lamar want right now? What he want me to be saying to people? What would he want me to be telling the world? So it's-it's hard, it's tough. &gt;&gt; NATALIE: You really rushed right there to be right by his side and were there the whole time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, no, I never left his side. I never left the hospital room, um, until we left to go to L.A. &gt;&gt; NATALIE: Were you worried that he might die? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Knowing he's in a coma and having to run these tests or make medical decisions, I... it's terrifying. Having to make these executive decisions is really hard, I think, on anybody, so it was definitely... probably one of the most emotionally stressful times ever in my life. &gt;&gt; NATALIE: How did you get through that time? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I talked to my dad a lot. It's... I have, like, conversations with him. People might think I'm crazy, but I love it. It gives me comfort. But there was a time I didn't shower for six or seven days, and, like, the doctors were like, "Okay, like, if we let your mom in here and watch him while he's sleeping, will you just go take a shower downstairs?" I was like, "Okay, sure." So... I smelled that bad, I guess, they were forcing me to shower. I'm very open and honest, but sometimes I share too much information. And this is a situation I've never been in before. It's sad and it's just a really weird, overwhelming, like, feeling. &gt;&gt; NATALIE: What has life, in this past year, taught you about yourself? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, it's taught me you could never guess what's going to happen tomorrow. And again, going back to you really need to live in the moment. And I don't know how I would live my life without my family. It's... it's the best support system in the world. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You know what I had today? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I had this guy come out to see what it's going to take to put in solar heating. I don't want to waste all of my stuff, so you put solar panels down here and it heats all the water up. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why is it cold? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Hey, not even close to what it's been. Do you know how cold it's been out here? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: For the last week? We can't even go outside. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's been colder than New York. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Speaking of New York... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Victoria's Secret. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, first of all, I have to say I was upset. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Because you said I couldn't come. You know I was going to show up whether you said I couldn't come or not. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. Last week, I walked in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. It was something that I've always dreamed of. ♫ ♫ I literally didn't want anyone in my family to come to the show; I didn't want it to be taken over by a media frenzy with them, but in the end, my dad and my mom ended up coming, and everything turned out amazing. It was nothing personal. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: But you have to realize we take it personal. I love when anybody, but especially my kids, fulfill their dreams. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It was good. It was fun. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Are you gonna do it again or not? What do you think? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Who knows? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Who knows? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We'll cross that bridge when we get there. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yes, cross that bridge, absolutely. But you did good. I was proud of you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That was the worst high-five ever. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so annoyed at every last person. I've been cussing everyone out all day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: Our move-in date is now March. Our lights came in, and they were all the wrong lights, so the whole house, you can't put the floors or the walls or anything in until the lights are done. Hey. You and I are having an emergency meeting tomorrow. &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I told my mom to go look at the house, and she, like, looked at it and said, "You're not moving in until next July." I can't, like, I just, I can't live like this. I can't live in my mom's house anymore. And if there's another team that I have to hire to pay to open up the walls, we'll do that. Just tell me who you think that is. &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: The main problem is, Kim, I could get 1,000 guys in there. I just don't have the materials. You know, I don't have the lights. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I specifically said if the lighting will hold anything up, we don't have to do it. &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: All right, let's talk, see what you're willing to not do. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna write everyone an e-mail. &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: All right, let's move on and we'll talk tomorrow and see what we can do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, bye. My construction is delayed again. I really, really, really wanted to be in my house when I have the baby. It's just so overwhelming. How should I start off this e-mail? "This is beyondup. This is so not fair to do to me and my family." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I am just kind of annoyed with the Victoria's Secret situation. I wasn't allowed to the after party, nothing. Everyone thinks I'm the jealous sister. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why's your house not ready still? What's going on? Your clothes are in a garage right now. Another baby in that house, it's gonna be crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! Scotty! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to end up in the same situation that I just got out of. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so glad I don't have pets. I can't even tell you. Ew. You guys, I'm not into dogs. Literally. I just found out that Khloe's doing a post about me saying the word "literally." I think from hanging out with you a lot, I've been saying the word more than I normally do, which I normally say it a lot. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like I'm saying it even more. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I say it a lot. Just life. So, I'm gonna go to Australia with Kendall. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Because our clothing line is launching. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, that's fun. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, it's pretty cool, but I am just kind of annoyed with the Victoria's Secret situation. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And how she didn't, like, want us to come or whatever. But everyone thinks I'm the jealous sister. And I didn't show up because I was so jealous. Kendall didn't really want anyone else to have attention on the biggest night of her life, which I totally understand, but I feel like we're all, like, kind of known for, like, supporting each other. And now I feel like it almost backfired, and now it's like more attention on me that I didn't go. So I just feel like people are kind of blowing this up. We should just support each other and not worry. 'Cause if I, that was me, I would say, "Yeah, sure, come." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think you should talk to her for sure. Maybe just say that your feelings are hurt and that, like, you really wish you could've been there to support her. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, it's hard to not care, but I feel like, you know, just try your best. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hello. Where have you been? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have been a huge whale, roaming around town. So, I went to the doctor today. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: And the baby already is seven pounds, which is, like, unheard of. It's supposed to be four. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Super baby? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, really healthy. Just, like, a big baby. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why is your house not ready still? What's going on? What are you gonna do? What about the other house? Why don't you guys move in there temporarily? Like, what's... &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, we're gonna be showing the house, so it's like, do we want that? People in and out while we're living there? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You can't be in your mom's for, like, six more months. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Our Bel Air house is done, so I have the option to move into that. This house was the reason why we had to move into my mom's the first time, but I want to sell our Bel Air house. So I, you know, I want that to be available for people to come look at it, and with a new baby, I just don't know if that's the best decision to move into it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's more convenient for you, the kids. Like, it's fine. And it's temporary. &gt;&gt; KIM: The only thing is, I never installed the closets. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Your clothes are in a garage right now. Who cares? You have to understand, another baby in that house, it's gonna be crazy. You need to make, like, a hard decision on it, and, like, do it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; HOSTESS: Welcome to Regatta, everyone. Thank you for being here today for the Kendall + Kylie Collection at Forever New. Can you please put your hands together and welcome Kendall and Kylie Jenner. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm in Australia with Kendall, and our line has finally launched here, so it's really exciting, but I also do want to see Australia and would love to explore it. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Welcome to Australia. It's an absolute pleasure to have you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're excited to be here. It's my second time, her first time. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My first time. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Now, you guys did a collaboration with Forever New, and you guys designed the collection. So tell me about that process. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I think that, uh, this collection was kind of our first more mature collection than stuff we've done in the past, so I think it was something that we really put a lot of effort into. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: More mature, and, like, high-end. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Now, I have to ask you about your show last week. I mean, you must have been so proud of your sister doing the Victoria's Secret Show. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So proud of her. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Tell me how that whole experience was. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I mean, I've literally wanted to do it since before I can remember, and, like, my dad saw the show and afterwards, like, made me cry, 'cause she was crying. And it was just, like, an emotional thing, but it was super exciting. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Now, you must be so proud, but I hear that you got banned from doing the show? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Banned? &gt;&gt; REPORTER: From going, from, to the show with her? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I didn't get banned. I think she just felt the pressure. So now it's like I'm jealous of Kendall and I'm banned from the VS Show. And they're all lies, and it's just not something I want to deal with. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Well, thank you so much, ladies, and enjoy your time in Australia. We absolutely love having you here, and, um, we'll see you soon. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: See you soon. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, answer the question. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I forgot it, 'cause I was so mad. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie is lagging and being snippy. I don't even know why. &gt;&gt; KIM: If it's stuck like this, then I need to have a C-section. The delivery is way more scary to me. Two weeks. I can't deliver any later, they said. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, I was gonna call you and talk to you last night about this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Your whole face has changed. Did you do any... filler? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Craziest laugh. No, I asked her that. She said no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No! I haven't. &gt;&gt; KIM: You haven't done any Botox? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, your whole face changes when you laugh. It's like, I stare at you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, wait. But, you guys, I think it's 'cause, like, I'm forcing a fake laugh. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, you really are laughing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, 'cause you were so laughing so hard. &gt;&gt; KIM: You noticed it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes! &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought she was on drugs. I... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You think I'm on drugs?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, you're gonna die. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, like, I'm, like, freaking out right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's, like, her whole gums and teeth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got to go. Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: How was your therapy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Intense? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Intense. Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, what therapy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I had to go to therapy-- or I didn't have to. &gt;&gt; KIM: With Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Yesterday. &gt;&gt; KIM: How'd it go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, if you are going to therapy with him, does that mean you want to work it out? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: You just want to, like, help him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to have a relationship with him for my whole life. I have committed to going to therapy with Scott once a week. You know, we do have three kids together, and I think it's really important to be friends, be there for each other. &gt;&gt; KIM: What if he was like, "I'm back, I'm normal. Oh, my God."? Would you take him back? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He definitely gets ahead of himself. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: He thinks he's, like, cured already? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Feel like he's always like that. Feel like there's no rush. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott is getting out of rehab soon, and of course we don't have a crystal ball to say what's gonna happen when he comes back. I just hope she's strong. I hope she sees, like, the bigger picture and she's not just gonna jump back into a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need to work on things just to co-parent together. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You guys look so excited. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. I'm just genuinely hurt, and I feel a little neglected. I wish Kendall would just speak up about this Victoria's Secret show and-and all the rumors. She's just really focusing on herself. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, answer the question. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I forgot it 'cause I was so mad. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Uh, could you describe Kendall's style for me in a few words? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Um, it's, like, simple and... sophisticated. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We have tons of press to do, and of course Kylie is lagging and being snippy. I don't even know why she's acting like this. She just needs to relax and enjoy the trip. Wait, Kylie, look around. You have to look around. Look how pretty it is. Like, the sky is so blue. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, the sky is so blue. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, wow, you guys really redid this place. This used to be, like, a barnyard. &gt;&gt; KIM: They tore it down. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This was a chicken coop that you guys made into, like, a modern palace. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, insane. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Love this. I wish I had this house. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is the gorgeous counter. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: You should've seen the paint color they chose. The whole house was painted periwinkle, and I was like... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Periwinkle? &gt;&gt; KIM: Pretty much. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Sick. Wow. People would kill for this. People would sell their children to live in a house like this. This is amazing. Why wouldn't you want to move in here for four months? &gt;&gt; KIM: But then to furnish it all, and then... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You have furniture from your old house. &gt;&gt; KIM: We do, but, like, will it all go? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, for two months. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's not. It's till March now. Then what if it sells? Then we have to move out right away. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I mean, don't have a baby over it. &gt;&gt; KIM: The house is looking amazing, but there's still so much that we'd want to do to it in order to get the house ready to be sold, and it just might be more hassle than it's worth. I just don't think it's an option anymore. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: So I don't see you moving in here. So what's the plan? &gt;&gt; KIM: Ugh, I just don't want to have to live with my mom. We've been living with my mom for, like, it'll be a total of two years, maybe two years and a month. I mean, we're already at my mom's house, so it's obviously easier to stay there, but, you know, my mom's house is really crazy. There's so many people in and out-- just so overwhelming. It's too much to move in here and figure it all out and, like, make it perfect. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: My-my question is, what if it's not March? If it's, like, July, Kanye might lose an arm. &gt;&gt; KIM: He said, "I feel like a struggle rapper living in my baby mama's mama's house." &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: "Mama's mama's." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My face just feels like a little robot. So I was reading everything on Twitter and stuff. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: About what? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: The VS show. I have been a little passive-aggressive towards Kendall. She doesn't seem to be understanding why I'm upset, but we just need to talk. Everyone thinks that I'm the bad guy or I'm so jealous. And everyone was like, "You're so... you're such a jealous sister. Like, how could you not go?" And I know you don't want anybody there, but it feels like turning on me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But, like, it's not like that at all. And who cares what people think? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's just kind of hurtful, because I wanted to be at the show and support you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's a lot to have every single one of you there for me. It's just, like, an extra amount of pressure and, like... I'm really sorry if your feelings were hurt. It was kind of my night, and I wanted to take it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Totally. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I told everyone not to come. I didn't need all that pressure there. Kylie respected what I asked of her. But every day, there's some false story about my family that someone likes to make up. They love to spin everything, so I can understand why it's frustrating. Sometimes things get to me, too. But you know I love you, boo. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love you, bitch. &gt;&gt; KENDALL and KYLIE: I'll never stop loving you, bitch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously, my smile is soup. Watch this. Are you ready? How crazy? It's like it only goes horizontally. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It doesn't go up anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It doesn't go up. Wait, but seriously, like, do you think, like, sucking dick could affect that? I'm not kidding. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I have no idea, but that's the craziest thing I've ever heard, 'cause hookers don't have smiles like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it's the stress from Lamar. I'm not kidding. So this was the day, my photo shoot before, and this was after. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I was very upset to see him. Unbelievable that he looked that good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Guv'ny. Your hair's long again? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, it's extensions. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, you've been in this game way too long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why do you think it's this fluffy? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It looks good though. It doesn't look weird. It's not, like, "Wow, what's wrong with you?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, so I'm, like, to the doctors, "How are you gonna leave this person?" Like, he's gonna leave there on the 24th, so I'm going there tomorrow to meet with, like, four or five of his doctors in the morning. &gt;&gt; KIM: He needs to go to a home, but where is that home? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: On Monday, the doctors were like, we'll need, like, home nursing and blah, blah, blah. Um, and they were asking me if I had an elevator in my house or this, and I'm like... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I mean, if you're responsible for him, that's like, you're locked in for life. Like, at your house, it's different. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The doctors told me that Lamar could be going home as early as two weeks. We could be discharged from the hospital and he would be going home, but Lamar lives in Vegas, and he needs full-time care. So... I just don't really know what to do. I feel very overwhelmed. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Khloe, do not let them con you into it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ah, I just went to the doctor. Someone help me take my boots off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoa, look at that foot. Kourt, look at my feet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's very swollen. Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What does he say about that? &gt;&gt; KIM: He said he thinks it's the preeclampsia coming back. But the baby's breech. My baby is breech. The delivery is way more scary to me because I have to get the baby turned and in the right position. Otherwise, there could be some complications. We basically have to get this baby to term within the next week. If it's stuck like this, then I need to have a C-section. I have a little bit of high blood pressure, and I have ur... protein in my urine, which are both indications of preeclampsia, so I have to deliver before Thanksgiving, November 23. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's so much going on in our family. Khloe is figuring out everything going on with Lamar. Scott is going to leave rehab. And now to find out that the baby is breech. It's, like, one thing after the other. &gt;&gt; KIM: Two weeks. I can't deliver any later, he said. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MAN: Kendall, is there a lot of clothes-sharing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: With us two, we just love to fight, so it's, like, a fighting thing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think we're fighting right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The doctor said they're "disappointed" with the lack of growth that he's had. He's great one day, and then tomorrow he will completely regress. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ANDY: Ah, Kendall, Kylie, thank you very much for joining The Hamish &amp; Andy Show. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, of course. Thanks for having us. &gt;&gt; ANDY: Um, a limited edition Kendall + Kylie collection for Forever New. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; ANDY: Are there some bits that are Kylie and some bits that are Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The cool part about having two people working on a clothing line is that you kind of get two opinions on it, and, for the most part, we have the... we do have the same taste. I think we both really like the same things. &gt;&gt; HAMISH: Who gets the split vote if you guys can't decide? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm, like, a sucker, and I usually end up giving in. If she, like, really hates something, I'll just be like, "Ugh, fine, get rid of it." &gt;&gt; HAMISH: Well, growing up, is there a lot of clothes-sharing that goes on between sisters? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's clothes-stealing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, with us two, we just love to fight, so it's, like, a fighting thing, and we just steal each other's stuff and make it a big deal. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think we're fighting right now. &gt;&gt; ANDY: Are you guys...? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; HAMISH: Damn it, I was gonna say, this is a lovely fight. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Even though Kendall and I make each other mad sometimes, she is still my sister, and I love her to pieces. Now we can finish our appearances and go out and explore Australia. &gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER: How much of a strength, uh, and support have you two been for each other? Because you-you literally have grown up together in this incredibly unique situation. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um, I think it's... it's really amazing, and to have her do it with me, it's, um, someone you can always lean on, it's someone you can always talk to if you're having, like, some issue and, like, figure it out together, so... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Like, I couldn't even imagine doing all this without Kendall. It's like having your best friend with you all the time. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Sometimes I take working with Kylie for granted. In this world, there's kind of a lot of people telling you what to do, what you shouldn't do, who you should invite, who you shouldn't invite. And I can't let that get in the way of me and my family. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's really nice to have someone that can understand what you're going through. &gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER: Thank you very much for your time, ladies. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Up to the room, she can go change. The turnaround's quick. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm obsessed with Australia. I can't wait to come back. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Well, I mean, absolutely awesome... ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you hungry for? &gt;&gt; MASON: A doughnut. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, we don't have doughnuts here. &gt;&gt; MASON: Go to Lovey's house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I have a hug hello? You know the rules. Out of being kind, what do you do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really appreciate that hug. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Give KoKo a hug. &gt;&gt; MASON: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's how we greet our family members. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you greet your family members? With hugs? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Uh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why do you like to say "uh, yeah" now? The kids just called. And Lamar just can't talk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can't talk, like, on FaceTime? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, like, no words were coming out today. It's like, the doctor was like, "You can tell he wants to talk but just can't come out." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that normal to get worse? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The doctor said they're "disappointed" with the lack of growth that he's had. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just really sad. Let's call Mom one more time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, babe, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, I'm here with Kourtney and Penelope. Um... you said you were gonna see, like, some other... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Go upstairs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...facilities for Lam. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We'll be right back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, options that are in Westlake and in Thousand Oaks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There has to be a place closer. I need to see him, like, almost every day or every day, and if I... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, well, there's... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't drive to San Diego. I had a meeting with all of Lamar's doctors, and once Lamar is discharged, he will go to, like, a transition assisted living place, because he's great one day, and then tomorrow he will completely regress, and it's my job to find the best therapy that I can get my hands on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a meeting tomorrow with the head of UCLA. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So tomorrow I'll have answers? 'Cause I'm supposed to tour places this weekend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. I'm doing my best, I promise. I love you, beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you too, gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney is, like, on... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's a new Kourtney. I've never seen anything like it. How is she gonna go back to, like, fake married life? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is there anything else that she could, like, do to, like, get the baby to turn around? There's a lot of issues that she's dealing with. I wish there was something I could do to make it better for her, because I worry. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I have, just, all my skin tags. I got 'em burned off before, but they never came off. &gt;&gt; DERMATOLOGIST: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ugh, they're because of my pregnancy hormones. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Kim, they're not that bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I know they're not that bad, but I just... &gt;&gt; LARSA: You want 'em gone. Do they get stuck on your necklace? Like... &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; LARSA: No, 'cause have you heard that? I've heard people that, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; LARSA: If doesn't get rid of 'em, that's what's gonna happen. They get bigger, and if they get bigger as she's wearing a necklace, it's gonna get hooked on her necklace. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's... that's so funny. &gt;&gt; LARSA: We went out to dinner yesterday. &gt;&gt; KIM: How was it? &gt;&gt; LARSA: It was kind of... &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney is, like, on... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's a new Kourtney. I've never seen anything like it. How is she gonna go back to, like, fake married life? &gt;&gt; LARSA: She's never gonna... &gt;&gt; KIM: She's not, I don't think she's gonna. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why's she in therapy with Scott then? &gt;&gt; LARSA: 'Cause she's helping him. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think she's just, like, help... It's the father of her children. &gt;&gt; LARSA: She broke it down, and she said she doesn't even know what she's gonna do tomorrow, but today, where she is now, she wants him to get better for the kids. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Knock, knock. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Hello. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is Jonathan, this is Larsa. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Hi. Hi. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Hi, hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: My neck again. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Ugh. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Breathe, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, what's that vagina thing you were telling me about? We got to tell Larsa. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Takes about 45 minutes, and it'll tighten the vaginal canal. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look, maybe you should do it. &gt;&gt; LARSA: No, I'm not ready for it now; I'm not spreading eagle right now, not mentally. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; LARSA: 'Cause it's... they're sticking something in your vagina-- you have to be prepared for that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I never have to be prepared for that. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Ew, that's a... ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: So I'm gonna put a plan together for this breech birth. You comfortable? Get your head there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: So let's take this off. Hey, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. How are you? &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: Good. So I assessed her legs and found out that the sacrum is causing pressure on the nervous system. &gt;&gt; KIM: I hope you don't mind we turned this room into a chiropractor's office. &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: The main thing that's happening is that her spine is very compressed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right, 'cause, yeah. I think he's breech right now. &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: Right, he's breech now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim is still trying to figure out where she really wants to be living. She's also just found out that her baby is breech, which puts more stress on the whole situation. It's a very dangerous thing potentially. All right, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: My bed is so high that I have to do a full sit-up every time I get up out of bed. To pee, to move, to switch positions. I get these awful cramps every time I sit up. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I worry. I just, you know, she's so pregnant, there's a lot of issues that she's dealing with, and I don't want anything to go wrong with her pregnancy. I wish there was something I could do to make it better for her. &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: The more distressed you are, the more it keeps it... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: ...uh, locked in its position. The baby wants to move, it's just that all this tension... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're stressed out. &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: So I'm gonna need to see you in two days. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: We'll figure it out. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's getting a little cramped over at the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really hate how stressed-out Kim's been living at my house. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you insane? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Scotty! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Seeing Scott, I just don't really know how to be yet. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JEFF: Let's just pull the rug. A little more. That's good. Kris, do you like this amount of space over here now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. And there's plenty of room over here. It's, like, perfect. I really hate how stressed out Kim's been living at my house lately, and as a coincidence, I was driving around town and saw a place that magically was so familiar to me, because Kim's grandparents used to live there. And I thought maybe this is a sign. &gt;&gt; JEFF: This is definitely a different look for you. I like it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do, too. Buying this piece of property is probably one of the best things I've ever done and I feel so good about it. This way, I can be out of her way. She can have her baby and bring him home from the hospital and be peaceful and have space. And I think it will be really good for both of us. &gt;&gt; COREY: It's time for something to eat. Use my phone right here, up the couch. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Needs something up there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe if Karl Lagerfeld comes over, he'd just sign his name... &gt;&gt; JEFF: In lipstick! In lipstick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'd love that. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You want to rub this on your pants so it goes away? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Will it go away, though? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, like that? Yes! Even though I've canceled so much of my book, plus I'm still doing a few books signings, so I am in San Diego right now. Hi. Hi. This is the farthest I've been away from Lamar since all of this stuff happened. I wanted to go a little further than just L.A., but still I'm comfortable that I can drive there and drive right back in case anything ever were to happen. If my face starts doing something, you got to tell me. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay? Or mycome out, either one. &gt;&gt; CROWD: Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw! I love your glasses. Love them. Thanks... thank you. Hi! How handsome are you? Oh, you are so cute. No crying. But you look, you have a pretty cry, so go ahead and cry. &gt;&gt; MAN: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm great. How are you? &gt;&gt; MAN: Pretty good. How my bro Lamar doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's good. &gt;&gt; MAN: Is he? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, thank you for asking. &gt;&gt; MAN: He making a good recovery? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He is. I have found a great facility for Lamar. Still, there's a long way to go. Slowly, but surely, right? &gt;&gt; MAN: Serious? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, thank you! &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Next, please? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm really committed to Lamar's wellness first. And of course, I have to continue with my life and find the balance between Lamar and work. I got to try to get everything back to normal eventually. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye, guys. Bye, you guys! &gt;&gt; GIRL: Bye, Khloe! We love you! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, boo. Hi, you cute boy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He gives the best hugs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You give, give me a hug. Oh, you are so huggable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that your mom? Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You gonna go give her a hug? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Give Mommy a hug. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want Penelope's comb? No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scotty! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm out! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! You're out! Hi! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. Kris, how you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm happy to see you! Aw... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you come from there straight here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. What's your name? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Reign. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where's Mase? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I saw him go that way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Marty? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I'm so glad you're back. Good to have you back, Scotty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Seeing Scott, I mean, I don't know... I don't know. I'm really proud of Scott, you know, for being in rehab for 30 days. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Was this couch always this uncomfortable? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But he's just out. It's like I don't know what's gonna go on. I don't want to end up in the same situation that I just got out of. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where's Mase? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I saw him go that way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Marty? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I'm so glad you're back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Was this couch always this uncomfortable? Where are the pillows? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you guys sit on this couch like this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Was it weird to leave? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A little bit. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hey! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, my boy! My Marcel Marceau! How you doing, pretty boy? &gt;&gt; MASON: Good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's going on? Why you so clean? I'm gonna find P. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. Happy you're out. Well, I'm gonna let you enjoy your kids and visit with Scott. And I'm going to see you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. I just don't really know how to be yet. It just takes time to figure out, like, how to be with each other co-parenting our kids together. I just don't think the 30 days is, like, enough for me to, like, trust the situation. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Welcome to my new apartment. &gt;&gt; KIM: For who? &gt;&gt; KRIS: For me, because we felt so bad that you were so crazy with all those people at the house that... we got this. And we're gonna leave you alone in my house. This is my new getaway. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you insane? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom is like so crazy. I'm literally four centimeters dilated and the doctor's at the hospital getting our room ready. And she's, like, trying to show me her place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I realized that it was getting a little crowded over at the house and you were... might not gonna leave for a long time. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, the timing's a little off, but I'm so grateful and thankful that she got an amazing place, so that we won't be so on top of each other. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't it good? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And it's right above Nana's. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And the view, Kim, the street... &gt;&gt; KIM: This is really cozy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...is so beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom is so nice. She, you know, has been such a supportive person when she knows that I'm stressed out. I am so grateful for her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This rug looks so good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, wait. Mom, mywater just broke. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: In your new apartment. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your water just broke? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, can I please go to the bathroom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes! This is epic. Oh, my God. This is just spectacular. Did your water really break? &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously, Mom, I'm not kidding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is gonna be an amazing night. Let's go.
