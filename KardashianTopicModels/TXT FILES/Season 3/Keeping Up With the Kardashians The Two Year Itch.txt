- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just pour it on her head. I'll do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Honey, that's not nice. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! Feel anything on your head? Are you drunk? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did you guys do to me...? I can't stand. What's on my head? What is...? It's not funny, Khloe. What's on my head? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, you did it to yourself in your sleep! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't notice the you do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You were sleepwalking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! Oh! Not on my Gucci jacket. Are you insane? Khloe? Khloe? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What a nice way to treat your mother after a long day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm tired and I'm in menopause and I haven't had anything to drink in five days. &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE/KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: How are you doing? So I understand you're here to get your skin checked. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay, great, great. Let's get started. I'd like to take a look at you from top to bottom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to the dermatologist to get my moles checked, which I do every three to six months, and Kim's along with me because she's nosy and just wants to come. I do have a history with skin cancer. I've actually had three to five inches of skin removed on my back, and I have, like, a pretty big scar. &gt;&gt; KIM: She has a freckle on her toe right there. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: She actually has... Oh, that's just dirt. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay, now, has this one been growing or changing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. I've had it for so long. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: See, I would ask that dark spot over here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: And it has multiple colors? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: I think that we need to remove it and test it to make sure it's not melanoma. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Don't tell Mom. She, like, freaks out. But we'll tell her if it's something bad. My mom gets so freaked out about anything. And I don't want to stress anyone out. Right now it's nothing, so why tell? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You ready? Okay, you're gonna feel a little pinch, all right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No! &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Here goes. Some burning. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, this is just a little mole we're taking off, not her foot, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's amputating my toe! &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Touch it or something. Make sure it... &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: All right, tell me if you feel anything, okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Here it goes. That hurt? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, no! &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay, okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I saw it, I saw it. Ew! &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: We're gonna test that and make sure it's not melanoma. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Then what happens if it is? What else do you remove? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Well, let's not get ahead of ourself and just see what the biopsy shows. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See what the results are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really don't know what I'm getting, do you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't say that I do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't believe it's gonna be our two-year anniversary soon. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know, it's crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Isn't that when you're supposed to, like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Elope? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...reevaluate your situation or something? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you want to reevaluate? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I don't know. I think it's, like, a rule. Mine and Scott's two-year anniversary's coming up and I really cannot believe it's been that long. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think everything's fine now, don't you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. No, I'm saying I'm glad. I feel like it's a normal healthy relationship. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is there anything bothering you at this point? Or it's almost 100% perfect? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love Scott, and our relationship is going really well, but there's still that trust issue that hasn't gone away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He has a text message from somebody called "My wife," and it says, "I loved looking into your eyes last night." Then he wrote, "I wish I could come to L.A. for a week and not tell Kourt." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank God, it's gone to a perfect place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, good, I get the street. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm starving. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I wanted to talk to about what's going on with Dash. Even though Squidge really isn't my deal, I feel like we need a new location. We need to make it bigger. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I agree. A fresh start. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, it just doesn't represent us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys need a fresh start. &gt;&gt; KIM: I set up a really big meeting today with my sisters and my mom to discuss the future of our stores. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you talked to Khloe? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She didn't come home last night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She knew this was a big meeting for you guys and we need to get organized. &gt;&gt; KIM: Call her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What time is it? Where's my Blackberry? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just... it's not okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Normally, I talk to her all day long. She hasn't even called me once today. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's gonna kill me for saying anything, so you guys have to promise that you're not gonna tell her that I said anything &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, obviously, tell us. &gt;&gt; KIM: I went with her to her doctor's appointment... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and the doctor was concerned about something and wanted to do a little biopsy on something just to make sure that it was okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but I don't think that has to do with this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why would she tell her not to tell us if nothing was wrong? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think you're just too dramatic. You have to promise you will not say anything to Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I won't say anything, Kim. The fact that she didn't show up today is totally out of character for her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, that's a little weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's weird. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello? Hey. Um, I don't really know, like, exactly, but probably, like, tomorrow, I don't know. Everything's good, though, with it? All right, so I'll talk to you tomorrow. All right, bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who was that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was just Tom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That did not sound like how you guys talk. You guys talk ten million times a day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right, no, but he was just asking me something random about talking to him tomorrow about something. I told him I was about to go to bed, so I was, like, "Talk to you tomorrow." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whatever. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whatever. Look, last call. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: TM? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So when do you put Tom in your phone as TM? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He got a new number, so I put it in as TM because I already have stored as Tom Tom and Tom Wall. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: "Okay," nothing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, you're right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you talked to Khloe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I haven't heard from her today. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: I've been trying to get a hold of her since, like, yesterday afternoon. Her phone's been off. It's really weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you call Dash? &gt;&gt; KIM: I've called everyone at Dash. None of the girls know where she's at. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on with her? &gt;&gt; KIM: She didn't sleep home last night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So Khloe's had a biopsy. It's been days since the results, and I know they're in. It's really normal for me to think something could be really wrong. I went through that whole skin- cancer-scare thing with her, which was really serious. For all I know, Khloe could be in a hospital somewhere getting a treatment for something. Khloe's been down this road before, and it's always been an initial scare, but everything always turns out okay, so I know that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, you've reached my voicemail. Leave a message. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going to get out of here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going to run a couple... just random things I got to do, nothing big. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, just stupid stuff-- like not a big deal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott tells me he's got to go run an errand. Things are getting really shady around here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I got to run. I'm late. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going to get to the bottom of this, and I'm going to follow Scott until I know what theis going on. I drive by and I see him talking to another girl, giving her a hug. Oh, my God. I don't even know what to do. I'm so in shock. I'm so over this. I'm just done with Scott and his stories. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not cool to lie. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't believe I caught Scott with my own two eyes with another girl. I'm so over this. I'm over Scott. I've just got to get him the out of my house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney, what the ?! Hello? What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you go to your girlfriend's house that you've been hanging out with? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you even talking about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Figure it out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Figure what out? I didn't do anything, and you always think I'm doing something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You put those thoughts in my head a long time ago. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So you're going to throw myon the ground? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He is just lying straight to my face. Like, get theout of my house and out of my life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I try to frickin' do things for you and this is the way you repay me. Fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I finally get in touch with Khloe. Because I'm not supposed to let Khloe know that I know she got a biopsy, I'm going to have to figure out another way in. What do you think this is for? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a light to look up your vagina tunnel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Va-jay-jay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so glad you came with me to the doctor today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I'm supportive. What else do you want from me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, if you ever needed me to go to a doctor's appointment with you, I would go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What theare you talking about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you ever wanted me to go with you, I would go with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go with me where? &gt;&gt; KRIS: To like, any kind of an appointment you might have. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did Kim happen to tell you anything about a doctor's appointment? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean did Kim tell me something? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, why are you being all inquisitive about doctor's offices and stuff? Where is this coming from? You just randomly thought about this off the top of your head? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we're sitting in in a doctor's office, and I just wanted you to know that I'm always here for you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I think you are beingshady. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, what about the huge business meeting? You don't show up, and Kourtney said you didn't come home the night before. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, honestly I really thought you brought me here to spend time with you and like, it's like a bonding thing and you really wanted to take me to lunch and hang out, but obviously, this is not really why I'm here. And you're trying to like, getout of me. And it's not cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who gets that angry if there's nothing wrong? Khloe wouldn't be this mad at me trying to get into her business if she didn't have something to hide. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to lunch with my real sister. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's so not fair. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, why are all of Scott's clothes here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because he is cheating on me with some nasty whore. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. This girl-- I saw them. I saw it with my own eyes. &gt;&gt; KIM: You saw it with your own eyes? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I called you. You don't answer your phone ever. I called you like three times. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tell me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He was talking on the phone, and I could clearly hear a girl's voice and he was like, "I'm talking to Tom." And I looked in his phone. It says "T.M." And I just knew that something was going on. And then I followed him, and I saw him with my own eyes with a girl like clearly right in front of me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Scott really wanted to surprise Kourtney for their anniversary so last week he asked me to go to a jewelry store with him. Let's look at the watches. We find the perfect watch for Kourtney. It has the yellow gold and the diamonds that Kourtney's always wanted. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm Scott. &gt;&gt; NATASHA: Natasha. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, I'm Kim. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And this is Kim. &gt;&gt; NATASHA: Hi. Natasha. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, so perfect. &gt;&gt; NATASHA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Two days? &gt;&gt; KIM: So I've been talking to him on the phone, and I said pretend that I'm Tom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh! &gt;&gt; KIM: He just wanted to give you a nice gift for your anniversary. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Iup. Oh, my God. I just feel like such an idiot. I didn't trust Scott. &gt;&gt; KIM: This has to be a lesson for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel awful. What do I do? Please tell me. He's not going to answer my calls. &gt;&gt; KIM: You just call him and you just say... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm sure he's at Sean's house. Like, he has no other friends here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Go there and talk to him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know, what if I get there and he's like, won't speak to me or something? &gt;&gt; KIM: Then he's so dumb, and you shouldn't be with him, seriously. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just scared that he won't even want to talk to me, and that I don't know what to do from there. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna go call him and give him a heads up of what's going on, and that I ruined the whole surprise. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Will you find out if he's at Sean's, and then I'll go there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, for sure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, Lisa, you can be here tomorrow? Okay. All right, yeah. Yeah. And then Khloe will show up after everybody else. Khloe's having a really hard time telling me what's wrong. So I've asked her friends and some family to come over to offer their love and support for Khloe. I'm just going to let her know that we're here for her no matter what. So she's in a place where she feels safe and loved and once and for all tells what's going on. All right, bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I totally understand if Scott doesn't want to talk to me for a while, but I really hope he does. &gt;&gt; SEAN: Hold on, let me see if he's ready to talk to you 'cause I don't... you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SEAN: Hold on one second, okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, okay. I just feel awful for not trusting him. &gt;&gt; SEAN: Come in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SEAN: I've been taking care of him all day. He's like a sad little puppy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just had to tell you that I'm really sorry. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You couldn't have called me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I wanted to talk to you. And I just found out from Kim that you were trying to get me a surprise for our anniversary, and I had no idea. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I didn't try to explain that to you while you were going crazy on me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. You were acting so shady. And, like, our past history, like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But that's the past, and we've left that there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And you're right. I mean, I feel really, really bad, and I obviously made a big mistake. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Big. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. So are you ready to come home? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What am I gonna do, sit here with Sean for the rest of my life? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I hope not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Keeps asking me if I want to sleep in bed with him. He's sick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You probably love it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you. Thanks for trying to grow up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel awful for not trusting him. If I want to be with him and move forward in this relationship, I really have to let it go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi, Sean. &gt;&gt; SEAN: Okay, I can see you guys are all better now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, she came to her senses. &gt;&gt; SEAN: I mean, he almost left you for me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You would love it. &gt;&gt; SEAN: I would. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I acted like a psychopath. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Crazy. &gt;&gt; SEAN: It's okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For no reason. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I told him the story. &gt;&gt; SEAN: This is so cute. This is like a romantic moment. Let me see you guys kiss, kiss. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I am happy to see this, brother. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, look, it's Maria, everybody. &gt;&gt; MARIA: Hi! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, how are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good to see you again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, you're almost ready to pop. &gt;&gt; MARIA: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you feeling? So I brought everybody here, friends and family from all over the place, to lend Khloe love and support. And I don't know how she's gonna react. I'm really, really grateful that you guys all came to be here today because I'm really worried about Khloe. Couple years ago, she had her breast biopsy. She had pre-cancer cells. She's had things removed from her back. So I know this time that something's wrong. &gt;&gt; KIM: What if Khloe is totally fine and this has nothing to do with being sick or anything like that? My mom is nuts. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't force her to tell me what's wrong with her. &gt;&gt; MJ: Why don't you just ask her? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I tried. &gt;&gt; MJ: Obviously, she doesn't want to tell you right now. Maybe she's a little afraid, you know, scared. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, exactly. And that's why I brought all of you here together. Because if she is afraid, we need to let her know that we really love her. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, what's going on here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here she is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's happening? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Malika, why are you here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, I've asked everybody to come over today, because I really feel like you've been hiding something from me. And this is really hard for me to say... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this a joke? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...but I want you to know... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is this, like, an intervention? I'm more than lost. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we are here to tell you that it's okay for you to tell me if you're sick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, mentally sick? Like what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, Khloe, not mentally sick. I know you've been to the doctor. You wouldn't tell me about your biopsy that you got. Khloe, you can tell me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim. First of all, you guys are all freaking nuts, and I'm so sorry all you guys had to come out here. Are you, like, this menopausal that, like, you just need something to do to put all your energy to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What about the meeting we were supposed to have? You don't show up and Kourtney said you didn't come home the night before. What was that all about? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who cares? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Explain that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was at a boy's house! Why do you care?! &gt;&gt; MJ: A boy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A boy's house? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not dying! This is ridiculous. This is the time that we need to be concerned about Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you not sick? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm, no, I'm not. You knew I was dating someone. You let people come here, and you didn't feel the need to say anything? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I had no idea I was gonna see all of these people. And I didn't think you wanted me to tell them your business like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I don't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, Malika knows and I don't? What about us? I want to meet him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would rather have you guys meet him than this one. &gt;&gt; MJ: I know. Bring him down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She gets to meet him and I don't get to meet him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're a nightmare when it comes to meeting boys. You're like, "When are you getting married? How many kids? The house is gonna be right next door to mine." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Am I that bad? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris can meet the guy I'm dating after my honeymoon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, no. You don't deserve a hug. You are... Seriously, someone, the next intervention is for her. We're gonna admit her. &gt;&gt; MJ: We're just glad you're all right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm excited to meet Rashad. Are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'm excited to meet Khloe's new man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. I'm excited to meet Rashad. Are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'm excited to meet Khloe's new man. What do you think he's gonna be like? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I cannot believe that Khloe and I live together, and she's kept this a secret from me. I am so excited to meet Rashad. I feel like she must like him. She never introduces us to anyone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, she is on a lot of... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like ever. Like, she won't even mention... Oh, here they are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; RASHAD: What's up? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so nerve-racking to introduce the guy I'm dating to everyone. Rob... &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Wait, you're being real, right? &gt;&gt; RASHAD: I'm being real. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: See, I told you. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm actually having a really good time, and no one's really hassling me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys! Who's this lucky man? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. Rashad, Kim. Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; RASHAD: You, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rashad plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves. And he seems like a really nice guy. But I'm definitely gonna step in and make sure that this guy does not take advantage of my sister and treats her really good. All I'm telling you, Rashad, is if you hurt my sister... &gt;&gt; RASHAD: You're gonna kill me. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...I will hurt you. Do you understand me? &gt;&gt; RASHAD: Do you want the fork and knife? I don't want you to stab me, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: Buddy old pal, do you understand me? &gt;&gt; RASHAD: I do, I do, I do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The pressure of dating freaks me theout. That's why it's private. And this is stressing me out even more. &gt;&gt; RASHAD: I like that. That feels good. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, we're gonna be good friends then. &gt;&gt; RASHAD: Ah... &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Next onÂ <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>with the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't not go to Reggie's first game. &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie's gonna have to understand that I need to focus at my career right now. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Really, really not cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? My publicist Beth offered me this amazing opportunity to go to New York and host a fashion show. I'm going to move to New York. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not going to New York.
