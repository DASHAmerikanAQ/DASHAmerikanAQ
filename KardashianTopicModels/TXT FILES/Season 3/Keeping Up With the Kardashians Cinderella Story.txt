- &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, would you help me do the dishes? Thanks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm the red-headed stepchild. "Khloe, do this. Khloe, do that." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Robert. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you feel like getting a CD out of my car? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Ask Khloe. She's the stepchild. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is sick. Who washes plastic? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who wants water? Kourtney, you want some water? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can I have it with some lemon, please? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Lemon? Sure, sweetie. Here, can you just throw that away? Thanks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I-I'm thirsty, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No ice? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I do anything for you, Kourt? Rub your back? Mom, what would you like: a manicure, pedicure, bikini wax? &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's just a few more plates here, Khloe, and then you'll be done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I'll show you done, bitch. &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; -- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, where? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This. Wow, you guys all look like whores. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at Dad. I am so not a part of this family. Look how big my nose is. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Look at my shirt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, your skin color, your hair color, everything. I do not look like you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, yes, you do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I don't. You and Kim look identical. I look like I am adopted, I swear. You guys, just show me the birth certificates and I'll be fine. I am going to go find my real birth parents. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Khloe's adopted. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Give me my... I want to see my birth certificate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She is not adopted. She is just different in every way. You had different color hair, different color eyes, different color skin. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe needs a DNA test. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, let's take a DNA test. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna take a piece of your hair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Then you're going to have to get a piece of my hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get Bruce's. I swear I'm probably his kid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, I didn't even know Bruce at the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow, Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: We have a specimen of Khloe's hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That really hurt. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, I'm going online to see where I can get a home DNA test. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys think I'm joking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They don't have a home... this isn't an AIDS test. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What, you think they have home AIDS tests... &gt;&gt; KRIS: They do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...but they don't have a home DNA test? &gt;&gt; KIM: $80 million. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I knew I was adopted. I told you from day one. &gt;&gt; KIM: HomeDNA.com. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would my godmother go, "When are you going to tell her that she's adopted?" Why would someone say that if I'm really not adopted? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you mental? You really... you've been saying this since you were five years old. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just can't believe that I'm really, like, legitimately a part of this family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe that I'm legitimately a part of this family. I would like to make a toast to Rob. Daddy would be very proud of Rob, and I am proud, too. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Aw... that means so much when you're proud of me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Happy graduation. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob has just finished the last of his finals, and our whole family is getting together to celebrate. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Maybe you could, uh, loan me that Bentley of yours as a little gift-- graduation gift. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not a chance. If you want cars like Bentleys, honey, you're going to have to get a job pronto. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you're going to run around on your friends' private planes, at their hotels in Vegas, and blah, blah, blah, then, you know, start thinking along those lines. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, that's nice to do to your son and put that kind of pressure. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Growing up the way I did, surrounded by, you know, my parents' friends and my sisters' friends, everybody has a lot of money, so I just have the mindset to make a lot of money, and that's just what I have to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If I set up an internship, like if I can-- I'll ask some of my guy friends, do you think that's cool? Do you want...? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I would rather get a paid job. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll get you a paid internship. You're not going to work for free; you went to college at USC, business school. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: SMU, go Mustangs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A lot of people go to USC because they have such a great, you know, camaraderie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course she knows a lot about USC. She boned half the football team and the towel boys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, very funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's why I don't look like you people. I look like Rob's science teacher. Uh, hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is this mattress for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Move this... Somebody sent it to me. I think we should just put it on top of my bed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you just lay it on the floor and you sleep out here for a day? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you kiss my ass? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you want me to do with this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want you to drag it in the house somehow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You think I'm like a camel, and I can just throw this on my back and it'll be fine? &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's a way. Wait a minute. There's a way... yeah. There's a way... Let's just drag it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, move! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? Khloe, just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, it can't fit through a door. My mom definitely relies on me more than Kourtney and Kim. Like, I'm always the go-to girl and the fix-it girl. If you do not push, I will kill you. Push! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm trying, Khloe. Thank God for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, that's why you adopted me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't adopt you, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Free slavery. This is like the craziest thing. I should DNA test your ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, my pictures are kind of falling down. Khlo? Have a little respect. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, are you okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, suck it! &gt;&gt; KIM: So I just went to 14 Carats with Mom, and I totally found my engagement ring. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So what does that mean, you're engaged? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm just saying I found it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! Are you joking? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, God, I have to call this guy for Rob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How much is this? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, $300,000. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, how are you? I actually have a favor to ask you. My younger brother, Rob-- I think you've met him before. He is about to graduate from USC Business School... I'm calling my college friend, Ben, to set up an interview for Rob so he see what it's like to work in the real world. Okay, so this Wednesday? And then I'll call Rob right now. He'll be so excited. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...paternity test done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just looking at all this DNA testing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, this isn't even funny. You've seen the stories. You've heard them from your grandparents about the day that you were born and how exciting... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I haven't. No, I haven't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And everybody thought you were going to be a boy, but it was a girl. And then everybody got over it after 15 minutes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you guys, like, were disappointed when I was born? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was not... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that why you treat me the way you guys treat me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How do I treat you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just get treated differently than how she treats Kourtney and Kim. When I was ten years old, I would make dinner, set the table. You could always count on me. When you're ten, that's not really something you want to be doing. And I was doing it for years and years and years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, you're so obsessed with this whole thing that I think that you're going to be disappointed when you really find out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I... &gt;&gt; KRIS. Go do it... Go do it, find out that I'm your mom, and then what are you gonna do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not that big of a deal. If you are, congratulations. You have an amazing child. But if you're not, ta-ta. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm done. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where theis my car? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sure it's in the shop, like where it is every day. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. No, it's not. I just drove it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is Reg? &gt;&gt; KIM: He's out of town. He wouldn't have my car, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: My God, my car is not here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, I'm sure you left it at someone's house. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, I have two parking spaces in the... I left my Bentley at someone's house? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You left it at someone's house. Who's gonna take your car? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a Bentley. Who <i>wouldn't</i> take her car? Are you joking? Oh, my God, calm down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shut up, Khloe! When you have a son with a tattoo the size of Alabama on his chest. It's not okay! &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: Okay, so when did you notice it was missing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, 20 minutes ago. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: What kind of car was it? &gt;&gt; KIM: When I get home, I see my Bentley's missing, and immediately I call the police to file a police report. Oh. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: Is that it? &gt;&gt; KIM: That is my little brother. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What is going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? I... I called the police. I thought my car was stolen. How-How did you even get my key? I work hard, and I thought... Rob, get out of my car. I can't even believe Rob stole my Bentley. Kourtney? Khloe? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob is out of control. He had my car this whole time. He was out with my car. Rob? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What? What do you want? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. He'll come in. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sit down. Seriously, what is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Mm, nothing. I took your car for a little joy ride. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't think there's anything wrong with that, when I told you, no, you're not allowed to? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Uh, I didn't think it was that serious. I've taken Mom's car. I've taken... I mean, I've taken all you guys... It's not that big of a deal. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've told you. It's not even the car. It's just... &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You have all these things... I mean... &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think Rob is definitely going through a phase in his life. He's about to graduate college. It's just a weird time in your life. &gt;&gt; KIM: You sound like the biggest spoiled brat. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I took your car. You're being selfish. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not even that. No, it's not even that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not all. &gt;&gt; KIM: I called the police. I thought my car was stolen. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You're right. I need to go to rehab. You guys are right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Even though Rob stole my car, he's still my baby brother, and I can never stay mad at him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm a lot fatter than Adrienne. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hey, what's up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I got your suits, your dry cleaning. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would wear the striped one. Today's the big day when Rob goes in for his interview, and I'm just hoping that he gets the internship. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: How much money do you think I'll be getting at this job? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, a paid internship. I'm sure you'll get, like, a little bit more than minimum wage. It's a starting job. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I had a minimum wage job in high school. I need to be getting a little more... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Robert, it's a starting job. You're going for the experience. You can say you have other jobs. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: My dad always, uh, told me, "Time is money." So, you know, I'm 21 years old. I would love to, you know, have a couple million dollars by 25. So I'm not going to waste my time doing some minimum wage job. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, call me right when you're done. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. It's my paternity test. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, not, like, to see if I'm pregnant. Like, to see if my parents are my parents. I don't think Kris Jenner's my mom. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Someone that psychotic cannot be blood-related to me. "How it works. Using the enclosed cheek swabs, rub inside the cheek..." &gt;&gt; KENDAL: How are you going to get that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How the hell am I going to get a cotton swab into my mom's mouth without her thinking anything weird? What are you eating? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um... &gt;&gt; GIRL: Fake Swedish Fish. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Testing... I just saw Nicollette Sheridan buying these. So I thought if she can eat them, I can eat them. Oh, this is just horrible. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Spit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just bought it 'cause Nicollette Sheridan was eating it? That's really celebrity- influenced. Just open your mouth. &gt;&gt; GIRL: That bad? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to see your caps. I just want to see what they look like. Unh-uh, like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, what are you doing?! She is out of her mind. What was that all about? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is my mouth. My mouth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, I have boundaries. Warn me! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm busy getting your drug test results. I really don't know what you've been up to these days. You have the chills? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, you tested me to see if I'm your real mother. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How did you know? Who told you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And if you don't think that I'm your real mother, then there's something wrong with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There definitely is something wrong with me. That's already been discovered. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, honey. Get your little test off in the mail. And when you get your results back, we'll pop a bottle of champagne and celebrate. Okay, so get ready. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tubular. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It just depends on how happy you're going to be that I'm your real mom. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm not a stranger to tattoos. But I just... I've always been wanting to get another one. &gt;&gt; J.J.: So how did you settle on this one out of everything? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: It's my dad. Love him. I think it's perfect just to do, uh, do his face right there on my forearm. &gt;&gt; J.J.: Dude, Kourt's calling. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Just ignore it. I don't want to talk... &gt;&gt; J.J.: Ignore her? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Don't pick up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, Khloe came into Smooch today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She shoved a swab in my mouth to get my... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A swab for what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: To get a sample of my DNA. My DNA. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To get a... well, for what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because she wanted to see if I was her real mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, Khloe has a tendency to... be very dramatic, very over the top. I, honestly, think it's kind of funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not funny. It's... she's upset because I treat Kourtney differently than I treat Kim, than I-- you know, treat Khloe. But she's got to stop the bitterness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, well, well... How the hell are you people? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe? Remember the language in my house... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, psycho. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...I don't want... you know, you can... Khloe, Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You said around the kids. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The language... no, I said "on my property." You didn't actually go out and have your DNA done, or you were just kidding about that? That's, like, the stupidest thing... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Her DNA? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I swabbed Mom's. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She swabbed my mouth. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, why are you being like this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just wanted to, like, prove a point, 'cause Mom, like, kisses Kim and Kourtney's ass. And she makes me, like, always take care of Kendal and Kylie. "Make this. Wash these dishes. Go get me this. I need to talk to you about Bruce. I'm a newly... my husband and I... Well, I love him, but he won't have sex or like..." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. I think Khloe's probably doing this whole "I'm not your child" thing, you know, the whole DNA thing, really to get Kris' attention. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to be treated like you guys bought me into this family, so now you guys can just treat me like a redheaded stepchild. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So you like me better than Mom? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, that's probably not an appropriate question at the time since Mom's about to cry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ugh, I am so pissed right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because Rob totally flaked on an internship that I set up for him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He got a tattoo today of, like, this huge thing of Dad and it's covering... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? Why would he get more tattoos? He has huge tattoos now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have no idea. Call him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob is usually really responsible, and usually a really good boy, so I'm shocked that I hear that he gets this huge tattoo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's not answering my phone calls though, but Adrienne and Kim both told me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you seen Rob's tattoos? He's got them all over, all over... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He added another one here-- this big! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Both of his arms are filled like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now here and here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, he's a, like, he's a... &gt;&gt; KRIS: "City of angels"? Wait a minute! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, calm down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. "Calm down"?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, now you're being dramatic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Calm down"? Shut up, Khloe! When you have a son with atattoo the size of Alabama on hischest, and then you tell me to calm down! It's not okay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, drama. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Am I the only one who hasn't seen it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, we haven't seen it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys are going to die. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously, we need to hold him down and laser that off his body. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: He likes the portrait. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, but what... who came up with "city of angels"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you think? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Certainly not me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is that, like, a motto of his? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I don't know anything about the city of angels. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that, like, his... You don't just think of a random slogan to put on. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: No, one of those thug guys that Rob wants to be like said it was hot, and then it became hot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All the thugs have one.. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: And I'm a cornball 'cause I'm just a Cheetah Girl. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hey! &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Hey. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Why are you guys all looking at me like...? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: So why are you guys all looking at me like...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I'm kind of annoyed with you personally. Because you, like, completely just ruined your body in my opinion. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Show us. Just show us the tattoos. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that coming out of clouds? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah, clouds. That look exactly like the picture in the hallway. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The hair looks exactly the same. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's weird. Wait, let me see the other one. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: This one, I'm getting... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you getting to it, Rob? Tell me what are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me just see it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't even know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me just see it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so stupid. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Look at your lower back. You just-- Rob, I have a cross with angel wings and it's small. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just calm down, Khloe. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: And what was under it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at you. "C.A., city of angels"? &gt;&gt; KIM: I definitely think that Rob getting a tattoo of my dad's face is definitely some kind of yearning for my dad. And he's graduating from the school that my dad graduated from. This is a very difficult time in his life, and I think he really wishes my dad was here for him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can figure out how to get a job on your own now because I made a phone call for you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, you're just up. You're marking your body, all these tattoos. You do not think it through. You listen to everybody else 'cause you're a dumb, so now you're going to live with this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't call him a dumb &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He has to know when he's a moron. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: When I make my first million, you won't be saying , Khloe, seriously. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob, this is getting out of control. Come with me in the other room. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No, I don't want to hear you guys just yell at me and always trying to keep me down. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just come with me in the other room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at you. You &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are totally going about this the wrong way. You are not making any sense of what you're saying. You don't earn respect by... having money is not respect. How many people do you know that have tons of money and they're not respectable people? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You guys always... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Money doesn't earn you respect. Okay, 'cause we worked hard to do so. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You guys are always out of town and in hotels and all this stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I realize that, like, you're trying to keep up with us, but you have to put in your time, too. You need to start from the bottom, just like we did. I just hope that you remember, like, you know, where you came from and... &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...keep the values that you were taught. Honesty, like, why did you blow off that interview? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I just didn't want to go to an interview for an internship. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should have talked to me about it 'cause that represents me. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You know, Kourtney's right. To succeed in life, you got to start at the bottom. You know, that's what she did. That's what Kim did. And I'm sorry for, you know, blowing it off. And I'll definitely be willing to do it again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, we could make up some kind of excuse. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm willing to, you know, take that job and work my way up. Money will come in due time. I'll take that internship. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: If you set it up again. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hey. &gt;&gt; MAN: How's it going? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Good, how are you? I'm not going to be some big shot, you know, right out of college, but... eventually. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guess what I got? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What'd you get, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tests! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Surprise, surprise. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have no STDs, but you have a child. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, I was there when you were born. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you stoked? You were? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Uh, a lot of pain that day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And you're still getting on my nerves. I love you very much, and as you guys grow up, you're going to end up... we're all going to have different relationships. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you got to stop, "Khloe, do the dishes.
