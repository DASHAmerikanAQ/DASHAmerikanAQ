- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why are you getting this? You don't need lipo. You have not a dot of cellulite on you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It doesn't matter if I have cellulite. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But isn't this what you're getting? You're delusional. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: <i>You're</i> delusional. I hate you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, is this the thing Kim got? VelaShape your body? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I might want to get this. Hi. &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Dr. Shalini. How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: As far back as I can remember, Khloe's always had body issues, and I'm always having to remind her how beautiful she is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I wave, nothing should wave back at you. I was just looking at your lipolysis, but Kourtney won't let me do it. &gt;&gt; SHALINI: Well, if you don't want anything invasive, the VelaShape procedure is a great route to go. You can actually target those areas that are bothering you. It's almost like you're a sculptor and you're whittling away or contouring away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is just an obese, fat cow that's stuck here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: People compare her all the time to Kim and I, and when she's standing next to us, she's five-foot nine, and I'm five-feet tall, so I'm actually really short and small. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bellybuttons, I have a fear if you touch them, they're gonna unravel. &gt;&gt; SHALINI: Do you mind if I go over your bellybutton? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, it's totally unraveling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, when you're born, it's where the food goes. Like, that's not weird? &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; I love this. I'm really into belts. Do you like that with the circle or not? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love this. I have to get this. That I love. &gt;&gt; She really knows how to shop, huh? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whenever I shop with Kim, I always get super nervous 'cause she buys, like, everything in sight. &gt;&gt; Your total is $19,723. That's after your discount. &gt;&gt; KIM: $19,000? &gt;&gt; Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim's always had a shopping problem. It's just escalated as she's made more money. &gt;&gt; KIM: How dope is it? Is it not the sickest thing you've ever seen in your life? &gt;&gt; I've got 12 boxes here for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 12 boxes?! What the hell do you have? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim has that, that, that, that and that. No one has to shop this much. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I love this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The title of this blog is Tranny Farouche: Sexy and Thrilled. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't read it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It says, "Every time I visit this site, I have to close my eyes when a picture of this beast is posted, and it keeps scrolling." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, tell her to stop reading this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "I'm not usually the one to say this, but she's one ugly" &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, you're not ugly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that it definitely breaks down Khloe's self-confidence when she constantly is hearing that she is an Amazon creature. She does get insecure about her body when she hears what people say. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: After reading this , I want to kill myself. They're probably like, "Look at that gorilla." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That person's either anorexic or a thousand pounds. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Yeah. Who's this? You know, I actually, like, I know about the organization. I don't know a lot about it. I'm not really, like, a vegan. I don't know if there was a misunderstanding. Yeah, that's great. I would love to set up a meeting. Um, I like to do mornings if that's possible. Thank you. And I will talk to you later, Michelle. I don't know if that was, like, a joke or what, but the people from PETA just called me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Pita Kitchen? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, PETA like the animal organization place. PETA is interested in having me come down to their offices. I'm actually very skeptical. I don't know if they want to talk to me about wearing leather or fur. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do they want you to do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have no idea. Maybe they want to hold me hostage until Kim gives up her chinchilla coats. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and I were just at Kim's house, and that bitch has a problem. And maybe she gets it from you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She does. Who else do you think she gets it from? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, that's not normal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She shops a lot. Okay, she's got a problem. She's spending too much money. The first step... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...is accepting that you have a problem. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you have to admit that you have a problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She spent 20 grand at a store. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 20... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In one store. &gt;&gt; KRIS: $20,000? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This isn't, like, a joke. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who do you go to for a shopping addiction? I mean, you don't go to AA. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim definitely has a shopping problem, and I think we all need to try and fix it immediately. I'm not sure if there's such a thing as a shopping addiction specialist, but I'm gonna try and find out. &gt;&gt; Weintraub and Smith. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Do you guys have interventionists for people with shopping problems? &gt;&gt; We mainly deal with alcohol and drug abuse, but, uh, yeah, we have a couple shopping addiction specialists. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would like to set something up with you if possible. &gt;&gt; All right, great. And, uh, your last name? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kardashian. &gt;&gt; Okay. And are you the one with the shopping addiction? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's actually my sister. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: PETA is having me come down to their offices. When I think about PETA, I think of extremists and people throwing red paint all over people's coats and vandalizing property, so I'm kinda nervous. Is Michelle here? &gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Michelle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: Very nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you for having me. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: Absolutely. Thank you for being here. Come on in. So we're huge fans of yours, in particular, um, so we're stoked that you're here. I read somewhere that you wanted to be a veterinarian when you were younger. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: I was, like, "This girl must be, like, really compassionate." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I used to want to, like, buy an RV and, like, go around the streets and, like, pick up lost animals. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: Oh, that's sweet. I want to ask you a question. We have a campaign called the "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" campaign. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: Might you consider starring in one of these "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" campaign is this huge PETA campaign that so many amazing celebrities have done: Christy Turlington, Eva Mendes, Pam Anderson. I really don't know if I have the right look for this. I'm just not like that supermodel type of girl. I don't have that skinny body. I just think I want to think about it, like, for the night. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: Well, if you don't mind, while I have you here, which is great, I was hoping to sit down with you and show you a couple videos about animals and their experience. And I have to warn you that some of the footage is a bit graphic, but, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's okay. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: You're sympathetic to animals... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: ...and you seem interested. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Michelle is showing me the fur video, and it is so sick, so violent, so vulgar. They just don't even give a And they beat them and they skin them and fry them and burn them. Oh, my God, oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: Do you wanna stop? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get it. I'll throw away all my fur. Is that what they do to bunnies, too? &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: They do that as well, but they'll also break their necks first, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: Another common practice is anal and genital electrocution. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: After seeing these videos, I don't ever want to wear fur again. I just don't think it's right. Certain things hit certain people, and this one really struck hard with me. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: Your influence alone will save countless animals. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'd be stupid to not do it, so I'm gonna do it. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: We would be honored. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've always kind of chosen to not go the nude route, but this is so classic and for such a good cause. Anything for a good cause that I believe in, I will do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I'm sure Kim will be pissed and feel, like, attacked. But sorry, we've already tried to talk to you on our own, and you obviously don't listen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, those-- Did you see the amounts of boxes she had? That's just not a normal scenario. Is that the guy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Someone's at the door. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; EVAN: Hi, I'm Evan. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? Kourtney. &gt;&gt; EVAN: Hey, Kourtney, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming. &gt;&gt; EVAN: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kris. &gt;&gt; EVAN: Hey, Kris, nice to meet you, I'm Evan... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi, I'm Bruce. &gt;&gt; EVAN: Hey, I'm Evan. If we were to really put this together and then actually confront Kim, but in a very loving, compassionate and truthful way, we would be able to then share with her our concerns. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; EVAN: And if she's having a hard time-- Look, the last thing that this family wants to see is, at the end of the day, this person who you all love sitting there with nothing. That would, that would drive you bananas. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think this intervention tonight is so necessary. Kim just needs an awakening. She needs somebody else that's an outsider to tell her, "Honey, you got to put down the credit card." Hi, Kimmy! I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you very much. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is my friend Evan. &gt;&gt; EVAN: Hey, how you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; EVAN: Good, good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go sit between... &gt;&gt; KIM: Go to my mom's house, and I walk inside, and they're having a little family meeting with some guy. &gt;&gt; EVAN: So my name's Evan. I'm a psychotherapist actually, an interventionist. Your family brought me here because they love you very much, and they're concerned, and they want to share a few thoughts with you. And if it's okay with you, can they do that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; EVAN: Okay. Why don't you tell Kim what makes her such a special person to you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; EVAN: What's some of the things you admire about her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love your kindness. You're sweet and a cute girl. However, you tend to overspend your money. You have a shopping problem. &gt;&gt; KIM: This guy is here to give me an intervention on shopping. &gt;&gt; EVAN: Good, excellent. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm so proud of you, and you work so hard, and good for you. You spent a hell of a lot of money on a Bentley, you spent more money-- It's like it's gonna last forever. It doesn't last forever. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys are acting like I'm going broke. The idea that I need professional help for a shopping addiction is so ridiculous, I cannot even-- Where would they even find someone like this? &gt;&gt; EVAN: Okay, so-so great. That's wonderful. You've agreed to accept the help, and that's exciting. And you've also agreed that you would trust Kourtney to go ahead and have your credit cards to make sure everything's working and everything's cool. And once again, your family's doing this because they love you, and they just want to see the best for you, and that's all. &gt;&gt; KIM: This was the biggest waste of time not only for me, but everyone that put this together-- my mom, Khloe, Kourtney-- everyone wasting their time to talk to me about this addiction that I have. I'm gonna spend the afternoon shopping. Seriously, that was really funny, but give me back my credit cards. I don't have a problem. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No! &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, that was amusing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sit, aah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What, you gave her back her credit cards? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I didn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was amusing. I do not have a problem. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you really don't have a problem, let's go to a sale and see how long it takes before you start buying up the whole shop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I dare us to all go there and watch Kim not spend a dime. We want her to see what she's doing and what she's doing to herself even when she's not conscious of it. So what better way to prove that point than to take her to a department store where it's irresistible? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll be there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll drive. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll be there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll get shot for bringing this up, but don't you think you could lose a few pounds? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ladies. A day of torture. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom and I have challenged Kim to come with us and watch us shop, and she's not allowed to buy one thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: These are really cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So sorry. Do you like this? Do you like this? Do you like this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe I'll get this. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that they're just being really insensitive at this point. They're kind of taunting me, showing me all these things that they're getting. And I'm just plain bored. The challenge is complete. I haven't shopped. You guys are shopping, that's fine, but I've been here for a few hours now with you shopping. I've had enough, I'm gonna go. Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, drama. Kim is definitely an addict. I mean, you're getting mad and defensive at us over shopping. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, we got to keep an eye on her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, we're not keeping an eye on her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what she does do, right? She totally puts stuff in the dressing room in her size. Okay. Kim can't get out of the store fast enough. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's a chance that Kim's back at the store shopping, and my gut says we should go check on her. There's, like, a chance that she's there, so pull them... Ooh, busted! Busted! &gt;&gt; KIM: I am an adult. I can do whatever I want. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what an alcoholic would say, when they're confronted with the problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's got to know that she has a problem. I mean, there's no way she can't know. She has to sneak back in and buy something. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys are crazy, crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're crazy? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You should know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, I don't know if, like, people want to see me, like, naked on, like, a billboard. Like, I'm known as, like... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I have seen you naked all the time. What are you talking about? If I love it, someone else will. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But apparently everyone in the world thinks I'm, like, a transvestite and a large and in charge woman. I really don't want to do a nude shoot. But I know how important the PETA cause is. It's so much more important than my personal insecurities. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Only your family has a dog named Gabbana. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Come on, Gabbana! The bitch almost took my fingers off! &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I've really been thinking about it. I feel really guilty for going back and shopping when I promised my family I wouldn't. This was my one challenge, and I should've stuck with it. I'm almost 30 years old. I shouldn't have blown up on my family like that. I shouldn't have gone behind their back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Bruce... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're doing this PETA thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I saw, like, how they make the fur coats, so I really don't want to wear furs anymore. That's why I want to do the campaign "Go Nak-- I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Another nude shot. Yeah, yeah. I'm real excited about this one. I've seen some of the other ads that PETA has done. You know, they said, "I'd Rather Go Nude Than Wear Fur," or whatever it is. And they're, um, about as tastefully done as I think you can possibly do a nude shot. I'll get shot for bringing this up, but don't you think you could lose a few pounds? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't you think you should lose a few pounds? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't think she should lose anything. She's perfect the way she is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm just saying. Do you think so? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have a rock-hard body. I'm just a bigger individual. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you are a bigger individual, but you could lose a few pounds. I mean, it's not major. Khloe, don't walk away. That's why... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm done. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's why you're running around wearing black. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was wearing black 'cause I was depressed! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Somebody needs to buy me a new label maker. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have one, it's right there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well I need a backup. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This isn't mother-daughter bonding mood. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're really cranky today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, look what the wind blew in! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh! &gt;&gt; KIM: I just wanted to say I-I feel really bad for walking out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What?! &gt;&gt; KIM: I think you guys are taking it a little bit too far. I'm not an addict. I definitely have a compulsive shopping problem, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's all, we're trying to help you save for a rainy day and learn how to invest some money in something other than the color of a blouse. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to have to sneak behind anyone's back to do anything or feel guilty, and I was feeling like I was doing something that I shouldn't have been doing, like I wa... I was feeling guilty. I-I think this time, I just want to promise myself that I'm not going to go crazy in a store. Every store I go into, I don't have to buy everything, so... I've had time to reflect on what my family's trying to say to me, and it probably wouldn't be such a bad idea if I put myself on a budget I just don't like lying to you guys, and I'm really sorry. I felt really bad, and I love you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We love you, too, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love you, too, biatch! &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you! Anyone want to go shopping? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today's the day of my PETA shoot. This is my best friend Malika; this is Michelle. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi, Michelle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The look of my shoot is kind of like cavewoman-ish. I'm a little nervous. I wish my body was, like, in a little better shape. It's awkward! I'm posing in front of like millions of people naked. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Khlo! You look skinny Minnie! Your little booty! Stop what? I'm just looking! I'm not doing anything. Look at that flat tummy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, I am. Bible! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It is! How come I can say it, but she can't? &gt;&gt; KIM: I go, "Look at that flat tummy..." What, do you want me to, like...? No, I'm saying you-you, like, lost some weight. You look great. Khloe is so nervous for this shoot. Khloe needs to not be so insecure with me, and I'm just there to support her. &gt;&gt; TROY: Khloe, you're gonna stand right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; TROY: And that's your beauty light. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can just, like, be like... &gt;&gt; TROY: Okay? Y'all set? Okay, come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look sexy. &gt;&gt; TROY: Drop the robe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think I want to do it anymore. &gt;&gt; TROY: Very funny. Drop the robe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really don't think I'm comfortable. &gt;&gt; TROY: Come on, Khloe, come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, now that I'm... &gt;&gt; TROY: We're all here, everyone's here, you're ready, you look gorgeous, you look beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: You chose a time when you're really comfortable... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm like a fat I don't want to be, like, nude on camera, and like, everyone be like,: "Kim Kardashian's fat, funny sister." No, I don't feel comfortable doing that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe! &gt;&gt; TROY: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KIM: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm just like... This is a lot of pressure. &gt;&gt; KIM: Take that robe off and go out there. &gt;&gt; Khloe what's wrong? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm just like... This is a lot of pressure. It's a lot right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but you've thought about this for, like, weeks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I knew this day was coming like... yesterday we spoke about it, like, everyone said, "Are you nervous?" like... "Wait, stop!" Like, "It's real!" &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, he's just like, "Drop the robe." No matter how nerve-wracking it is, trust me-- I did the same thing in <i>Playboy.</i> Taking off your clothes in front of dozens of people... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's why I'm so grateful you're here, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: You just have to like take a deep breath, and just like... inside, be like... Find the inner you! I've been through this. I did <i>Playboy.</i> I know exactly what it's like having to pose in front of all these people and you're naked, so I totally get it and I'm just there to support her. You're representing the animals. Just think you're, like... imagine that you just got skinned and all your clothes was your fur and your skin and they skinned you alive. Like, that's what happens to them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Take that robe off and go out there and show them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's the weirdest thing I've ever heard. Thanks for that pep talk. &gt;&gt; TROY: How you feel? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fine. Take it off? &gt;&gt; TROY: Take it off! &gt;&gt; KIM: Take it off! Whoo! &gt;&gt; TROY: Gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're so... Push out, like... Oh, my God, Khloe looks amazing. Perfection, it's heaven. Your body is bangin', baby! &gt;&gt; TROY: Actually, yeah. Right there, beautiful. Look more confident. Okay, look here, right in my lens. Really connect with the lens. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm really, really happy that I decided to do this campaign. Even though my body's not like Eva Mendes' or those other beautiful people, I have to be comfortable in my own skin. I cannot always want something else, it's just... I'm never gonna have it. I need to learn to love myself, and I feel like through this shoot, I really did, and I do think I'm beautiful anyway. &gt;&gt; TROY: And I want to see a touch of the breast underneath the arm. You okay? Eyes on me. Don't lose that energy in the face. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: Well, thank you guys all for being here today. I'm Michelle from PETA. We're so excited to be here, with the support of the Kardashian family, to release our latest "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" campaign with Khloe Kardashian. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS AND KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Khloe, you're beautiful. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: By doing the shoot, it definitely made me just feel beautiful, and I'm gonna have these shots forever. It really helped me be comfortable in my own skin. And in turn, I really hope this'll help animals keep their skin. It took a lot for me to do the ad. I'm not a typical stick-skinny girl, as you can see. I got a booty, I got boobies, I... you know, I have it. So, people need to know that you have to embrace your curves and embrace everything and love who you are, and that's what this is about-- "I'd rather go naked in any way that I am than wear fur." &gt;&gt; Next on <i>Keeping Up With the</i> <i>Kardashians...</i> &gt;&gt; Seems like you haven't had a colonoscopy yet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been avoiding it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really excited to start rehearsing for The Pussycat Dolls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you squinting? &gt;&gt; KIM: I need eye surgery. &gt;&gt; Give it up for Kim Kardashian! &gt;&gt; KIM: If I fall, it is gonna be humiliating.
