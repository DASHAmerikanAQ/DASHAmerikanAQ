- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who? I know. I want to know what the you need to talk to... Kylie's having a crisis. I'll call you right back. Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're using foul language in front of the kids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What did I say? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The "F" word. You don't even know you're saying it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I didn't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You just did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did I just say the "F" word? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You just did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I didn't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You just said... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The "F-U" word? That word? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I didn't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, in front of Kylie, you did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did I just say that? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, you did. Don't back her up. I heard it. Did you hear it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're old and crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If I hear one word coming out of either of those two girls... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie says it all the time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She better not. If I hear it, she is getting her mouth washed out with soap. You're to a much higher standard, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're at a higher standard than me. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it. We're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Guess what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My friend Lisa Falcone-- you know, that I've known forever? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She just calls me and wants me to be on the cover of <i>944,</i> a magazine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The cover? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All by myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What'd you tell her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, obviously I said yes, but I was like, "I've never done a cover." But they want it to be kind of like, "Who is Kourtney Kardashian?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, who's going to do all the... you know, sort of the details for you? I mean, do you get paid? Do you have hair and makeup? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you need me to help you, you know, with some of that stuff, I obviously do it all for Kim, so if you need any help, I'm happy to help you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom has been managing Kim for almost two years now. And I can totally see how, you know, she would be a great manager. Yay, my first cover! Whoo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo. Good job. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, I'm going back to Dash. You cute little momager you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's an amazing manager. I think it's a great idea. I think there's no other way to do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And you think it's not a good idea? She manages Bruce, Kim... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is my opinion. She kisses Kim's ass. Kim's her first major client. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe she'll kiss mine now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm actually shocked that Kourtney wants to take on Kris as a manager 'cause Kourtney talks so much about Kris and Kim's kiss-assing relationship. It's kind of shocking, but go ahead. Join the dark side, Kourt. So obviously she cares... &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce is her first major client. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce was 20 years in the making before she ever married his ass. And the only reason why she's his manager is 'cause Bruce is terrified to turn her down. It's like a high-paid prostitute. They sleep together, and she gets ten percent. I mean, come on. What kind of life is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, it's nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, I'm Kris. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is my mom. &gt;&gt; MARK: I'm Mark. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Mark. How are you? &gt;&gt; MARK: Welcome to our place. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I decide to hire my mom as my manager. See how things go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney's telling me you guys have asked her to do the cover of <i>944?</i> Is that a guaranteed cover? &gt;&gt; MARK: Guaranteed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause I've had issues before when, you know, Kourtney's really not interested in doing something that's not a cover shot at this point. &gt;&gt; MARK: We try and find the people that are about to like really blow up. And that's what we really see in Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And what kind of photographers are you planning on using? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom definitely knows what she's doing. She asks all the right questions. She actually does know the business. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. So that went really well. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, I thought it went really well. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's up? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, nothing... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's at home. I'll have to e-mail it to you 'cause I don't have it in front of me, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I just finished <i>Disaster Movie</i> with Carmen Electra and Vanessa Minnillo, and our first big promotion is Comic-Con in San Diego. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I'm excited. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Oh, my gosh, please try not to smack me in the face with the box. &gt;&gt; ROB: Adrienne and I have been together a little over a year now. She is a Cheetah Girl. I love her, and I really wanted to make it work. So Adrienne and I are moving in together. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I have never lived with a boyfriend before, so this is a huge step for me, and um, we just want it to go really well. Please don't tell me you actually packed one pair of your sneakers in a box? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm real anal. I clean all the counters at like... from the floors to the bathtub to the toilet. I think it's a good thing. I'm just very organized. No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: No, I'm gonna put your stuff on the top 'cause I can't reach it, babe. I'm like literally like on my tippy-toes. &gt;&gt; ROB: The colors are not color coordinated the way that I always do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, I couldn't sleep all night because of my shoot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're worthless. It's the morning of my <i>944</i> shoot; it's the big day. I'm really nervous and excited. Hey, Mom, I just got up. I guess I will just meet you at the studio. Okay, love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim and I are at Comic-Con today, which is a convention in San Diego, California. And Kim is there with Carmen Electra to promote her movie, <i>Disaster Movie.</i> &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: That's it. That's it. Lean into it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is so cute. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: That's right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey! &gt;&gt; TROY: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? Good to see you. &gt;&gt; TROY: How's it going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I get to the <i>944</i> shoot and start looking at what my looks are gonna be for the day. We start going over clothes. &gt;&gt; TROY: What I'd like to do and don't be scared... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes? &gt;&gt; TROY: I wanna chop your bangs. I'm gonna dirty the roots so it looks really, you know, white trash. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. All these questions and decisions are coming at me. &gt;&gt; TROY: We have you in bras and panties. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And this is when I really need her, especially in the beginning when we're getting everything set up. Hopefully she'll be here soon. &gt;&gt; TROY: Relax, okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm starting to really wonder, "Where is she?" I'm sure there's just traffic or something. &gt;&gt; MAN: Ladies, thank you so much for sitting with us. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: If one of you decided to jump the fence, would you consider marrying each other? &gt;&gt; CARMEN: You didn't know we were engaged? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're engaged. This ring is actually a ring I gave her. &gt;&gt; CARMEN: It means so much. &gt;&gt; MAN: See, lesbians are spontaneous. &gt;&gt; CARMEN: I love lesbians. &gt;&gt; MAN: Did you meet on Harmony.com? &gt;&gt; CARMEN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: We did. &gt;&gt; CARMEN: Yes, we did. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm calling my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've been at my photo shoot since 9:00 a.m. Aren't you coming? You said you were gonna be here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh,! I forgot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you joking? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You wanted to be my manager and I'm here literally by myself. How do you think that feels? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney's <i>944</i> cover's going on. She's in Los Angeles. I'm in San Diego, and it's bad. Obviously, I made a mistake today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, yeah, you shouldn't take on too many responsibilities that you can't handle. &gt;&gt; KIM: Go in the other room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you mad at me for it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm mad at her. She's supposed to be here. How am I supposed to know what to wear, like I don't have someone to tell me. They want me to not wear my top in one thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've dealt with this a few times when she's like, you know, double-booked me on things and you know... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you selling me down the river? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're selling me down the river. &gt;&gt; KIM: I told you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I heard exactly what you just said to her. That's not cool either. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I said it in front of your face earlier. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but I'm here with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I hired her to be here, and I'm really starting to get pissed off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, I don't even know what to say. 'Cause I blew it so bad. I just, I feel like I'm just torn in too many different directions, and I completely forgot and I just am asking you, you know, to forgive me. I don't know how to explain to Kourtney that I literally just forgot. I have no excuse. I can't blame it on anybody else other than myself. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's no way I could ever forgive you. You're so disappointing. This is such a joke. This is so unprofessional. Like, I can't even believe that people act this way. All you care about is Kim. So, go crawl up Kim's ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, why don't youpunish me because I'm not there. That's wrong too. You're making me feel really bad and there's nothing I can do about it now. It would take me three hours to get there and we're not... We can't leave for another two. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Leave me alone. You! I don't even want you here anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who needs Mom at a time like this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm never gonna forgive her for this, and I'll never get over it. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I wasn't raised with a maid like you. Maybe we moved in a little too soon. Maybe I'll just go back to New York. Bye-bye! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, I've got a problem. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can you hear me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have like the worst phone in America. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I do. I have the worst phone in America and I'm in a really bad mood so can you just try and listen to me? I literally forget to show up at Kourtney's <i>944</i> shoot. All I can think of is, where's Khloe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, we missed Kourtney's first photo shoot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom missed Kourt's first photo shoot, not me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can you go over there, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And help us out with this one? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom has overbooked herself, so, who does she call? Me. The best child in the world. Don't worry about Mom. Focus on your photo shoot. Who thecares? I'm gonna be so much more like inspirational than Mom could ever be. Mom would try to jump in your photos. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then be like, "Troy! Troy! Look at me!" Like where I would be like, "Go, Kourtney! Sexy bitch!" Kourtney is really pissed off about my mom not being here. And once you tick her off, it's like there's no turning back. &gt;&gt; TROY: Okay, go step in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I tell them they can't cut my hair, but I'm letting them shoot me in my underwear. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who needs Mom at a time like this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm glad that Khloe's here, but that doesn't take the place of my mom and I'm never gonna forgive her for this and I'll never get over it. &gt;&gt; ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Close your eyes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I forget that she's got amagazine shoot? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, I'm sure she's fine, and you never know, the magazine probably has... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just wanna cry. Kourtney is so mad that I'm actually afraid to call her back. And when Kourtney gets mad, she gets really mad. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ugh, what am I gonna do? Just push "ignore." Right there on the... Right there. I'm ignoring that beeyotch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, Kourtney! Look how pretty they are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me see, ooh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Divine Design. May I open it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Please do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's from Mom! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't say "ew." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I said, "ew." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom has a lot to look forward to from Kourtney now. Kourtney is gonna completely ignore her. Kourtney is dragging this out a little... long. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe! I don't care! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Dearest Kourtney, I am so so sorry." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't need to hear, thanks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "I didn't make it to your photo shoot." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop! I don't care! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "My heart, my heart is heavy, and I love you so very much." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "And I hope you will forgive me! I love you!" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love, look! It breaks my heart to see them fighting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can't just buy my affection with flowers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would hope not. But this is our mom. Like... it's family. You got to let it go. She's reaching out. You just, like, hold onto things for life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, I can't talk about this anymore. I got to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course you can't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ta-ta. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hide your feelings. Hi, babe! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, pretty girl. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Oh, my gosh, you guys have got to take those shoes off. Your brother's gonna flip. You have to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Who wants to take their shoes off? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: For my sake. I swear, Rob will walk in and be like, "Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. Somebo... Adrienne, who had their shoes on in this house?" I promise it to you. When things get rough, usually the people I call are Kim, Khloe, Kourtney or Kris, just to vent. And I know they're the ones that know Rob the most. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's so crazy. Like, every night before he'd go to bed, he'd take a yellow Post-It and write in, like, the neatest writing. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: What was he writing? &gt;&gt; KIM: He was writing a to-do list for the next day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Remember when you hugged him and he thought there was glitter on his suit? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: You hugged him one day, and you got, like, blush on his shoulder. Oh, my God, when we got back in the car, he was like... Vroom, vroom. He was like... Like, the whole way home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: He has, like, obsessive-compulsive disorder. He's so OCD. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Oh, my gosh, with everything, with everything. He's a little baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's a bitch. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob is the most obsessive-compulsive neat freak on the planet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If Scott has, like, a bottle of water, when he's done, he'll just be like... Throw it on the floor. Hey. I just hung up with Lisa, and I was like, you know, have you seen any of the pictures, and she said they wouldn't show them to her. Yeah. No, I know. I saw that you e-mailed it to her. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, isn't this what your manager should be doing? You shouldn't be calling, approving pictures. I mean, that's, like, they bring that to you and then you just check, check, check, check, check. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See, Mom would be doing all of this for you. But since you're not talking to her, you know, Mom can't help you. Kourtney literally has no emotion. She's a coldhearted snake. She does not care about other people's feelings. And once you tick her off, it's like there's no turning back. Mom's been calling you. She's trying to make it right, and you just ignore her. So how could she make up for something that she did wrong? Everyone makes mistakes. Are you that perfect that you can't accept it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Obviously. All right, I can't talk about this anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, then I feel bad for you. Get over it. &gt;&gt; ROB: What up? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Hi, baby. Did you play basketball? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Yeah. I'm so sleepy. &gt;&gt; ROB: So you cleaned up a little bit? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Yes, I did. I'm starving. I just came from dancing, so I'm like... made myself whatever's the quickest thing I could find. &gt;&gt; ROB: Use a frickin' coaster. That's disgusting. Babe, put this stuff away. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Baby, I'm not finished eating. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but you said you just cleaned, right? And... &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I did clean. I wiped down everything and I just got back. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, now you're gonna have to wipe down again. So I come home and Adrienne is eating on the couch, of course, making a mess. Yeah, this is annoying. I have to rip this paper off, for real. You got to learn to do what I do. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Rob automatically starts pointing out what's wrong in the apartment, what's dirty, what's not in place. I live here, too. I'm making my house rules, too. Starting with how about we not hear your voice so much. &gt;&gt; ROB: How about I could've been down to USC way... &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I could've been in New York. &gt;&gt; ROB: ...way out of the way. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I could've been in New York, where my mom's perfectly fine with the way I live. &gt;&gt; ROB: She cleans up for you, too. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: That is not true! I keep... I can't even take you right now, honestly. &gt;&gt; ROB: You want me to call her? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: No, I don't care. Okay, my mom helps me out, but she doesn't do everything for me. I wasn't raised with a maid like you. I know how to clean. I know how to cook. I know how to keep a household together. And I'm starting to think that maybe we moved in a little too soon. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, the crumbs are all on here. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Great! You can clean them up. Since you love cleaning so much, you can clean it up, and you can figure it out yourself. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm gonna have someone come, a couch cleaner. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Okay, Rob, maybe I'll just go back to New York. &gt;&gt; ROB: You-you're making marks on the wall. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: All right, bye-bye. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Rob. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: Just got into a fight with Adrienne. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know. She, like, just stormed out of the apartment. Adrienne's gone; I have no idea where she went, and I'm very worried about where she is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why do you think? Do you think it's 'cause you guys are spending way too much time together now that you guys live together? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know. It's just, she's all up in my space. Like, her makeup will be on my bathroom count... like, my side. Or, like, her hair extensions... &gt;&gt; KIM: Your side? You guys live together. There's no sides anymore. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but there's two sinks. I just don't... I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well... &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know why I'm, like, being such an ass, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob needs to realize that he's now living with someone else. They might not be as clean as he is. He needs to just chill out. This is, like, your first grown-up relationship, and you have to just make compromises. So you really need to think about how you're gonna compromise. You don't even need to have a huge talk. I would just apologize and make it better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, guys. My mom and Kourt are still not talking to each other. So I came up with an idea. Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And we are gonna sneak Kris into the house so Kourtney is forced to talk to her. Do you want to go get a snacky from downstairs? Kimmy's here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What kind of snack do you have in mind? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm kind of nervous 'cause I'm scared Kourtney's gonna, like, beat me with her little palms. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're gonna make a little snack. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; Hey Kourt So, Khloe goes upstairs. I'm downstairs, sneaking my mom in the kitchen. All we want to do is get Kourtney and my mom in a room together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're gonna make a little snack. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kid's snack? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look who's hiding in the kitchen, desperate Mom hiding there 'cause I won't talk to her. : Are you that desperate? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, pretty much. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You didn't call me back. They brought me over here so I could talk to you. You know, I just want to get on with this and apologize in person. I've been working so hard... &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, any normal manager is not just gonna have you and only you as a client. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a big surprise for you 'cause I want to prove to you that I can be a really good manager. And today I got on the phone, and I got you a three- to four- page spread in <i>Maxim Magazine</i> that pays crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, yay! I wanted you to be really excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not just gonna forgive you because of those things, though. And we'll move on from it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can move on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, we can move on! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hug your mom and manager. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe I have been a cold-hearted snake. It's not healthy in that it's not nice. People makes mistakes. I definitely need to be more forgiving. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you're so lame. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Hi. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, baby. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I missed you. &gt;&gt; ROB: My little girl, little girl. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: What did you do? What is this whole ambience situation we have going on here? &gt;&gt; ROB: Sit down, Princess. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Are you serious? Rob has been leaving me voice messages. I think I kind of freaked him out. &gt;&gt; ROB: I love you. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I see you left a little mess over there. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: A little bit of a mess? A bad thing? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. I have been really stupid about the whole thing, being way too anal. I got to make some changes. I'm really sorry for being crazy psycho. It's just really different, so you got to, like, you know, bear with me. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I'm totally down to learn how to do things his way, and decide to go to the Container Store. I'm not even happy is that the door-- they're, like, black ones that I got. I'm just gonna, like, cream colors.
