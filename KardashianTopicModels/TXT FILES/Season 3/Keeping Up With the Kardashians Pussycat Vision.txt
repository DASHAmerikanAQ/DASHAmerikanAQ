- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Were you there the other day when Kylie, or who was it-- Kendal got bit by a spider and she thought it was a black widow? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At the beach, yeah, they called me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And they were like, "Are you sure it's not a black widow? What if I die? How am I going to know...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They sent her home. I wish I could stay home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, Robin. Hi, Robin. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, mamacita. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: We might not be the Pussycat Dolls, but we're the Dash Dolls. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Oh, that's funny that you say that. You know, we talk so much about, like, you being a part of the Pussycat Dolls, and we need to you have do it right now. Like, you're just, you know, you're the biggest star in the world. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, Robin. I'm really excited to start rehearsing for the Pussycat Dolls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And it's actually perfect for Kim because she could maybe like recover after doing <i>Dancing with the Stars.</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I'm going to call you first thing in the morning. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: All right. Bye, girls. &gt;&gt; ALL: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It'll be good. I just... if you sing, I can't attend this fiasco. &gt;&gt; KIM: ♫ Don't cha... ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ♫ Don't cha... ♫ BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it. We're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Hi, Kim. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; MIKEY: Are you excited? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm nervous. I was telling Mikey. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: You are? Don't be nervous. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know everyone's done it before, so... &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Yeah, you're gonna... You're gonna be amazing. Trust me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm in good hands. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Don't worry. &gt;&gt; MIKEY: So we're gonna have you warm up in the bathtub. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: With my heels on? No way. &gt;&gt; MIKEY: Yeah, it's like a technique-- a bathtub warm-up technique. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you serious? I have never taken any dance lessons, ballet, tap, nothing. So I am extra nervous about this. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Okay, ready? And... Hey, everyone, good evening. Thank you so much for being here tonight. And you're going to go over... swish, swish, and up, and a little... mm, a little taste. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MIKEY: There you go. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Okay, keep posing. And open. And over. Don't look down. Hot, hot. Yep. Okay. Okay, and right, left, right, left, right... No, don't look at me. You have to look... you have to look at yourself. &gt;&gt; MIKEY: Look at the mirror. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Yeah. Okay? Don't... I know that you want to watch me, but you can see me through the mirror. Like, if you're looking at me here, you're never going to see yourself, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm rehearsing with Robin, and the mirror's really far away. It's hard for me to visualize, you know, the stuff that she wants me to do because my eyesight just really isn't that good. &gt;&gt; ROB: All this stuff, like, it's so important to see the shape of, like, what your body's doing. So that's why I just need you to see that, you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: Okay, so, and pull up. Don't look at me. Do not look at me. Look at yourself in the mirror. Yeah. Why are you squinting, though? You're like... it's so weird, I never... I never ever noticed that you're a squinter. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, I can't really see that good far away. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: But it's not far away. It's right there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kind of far. I know that my vision has been getting worse and worse. I never really did anything about it. I've just kind of dealt with it. She just thinks I'm doing it all wrong. I just know that I'm not myself right now, and I just feel like if I went home and just like regrouped, I would just get it together and feel so much better. &gt;&gt; ROBIN: If you can, when you're home, go and get in your bathtub and try to rehearse it on your own, you know. 'Cause I don't want you to come back and then not know what you're doing, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing, honey? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I just came from Robin's house. We had dance rehearsal today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's it going? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's awful. Like, I just want you to cancel it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not canceling it, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was so bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're being dramatic. &gt;&gt; KIM: I couldn't do anything. I cannot see what she's doing in the mirror. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't see anything? Your eye vision is that bad? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, obviously not blind, but it's going to be in a nightclub. It's going to be dark. It's hard for me to see at night when I drive, let alone stand on a huge platform. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, I have been telling you for 18 months that it's probably a great idea to get LASIK surgery. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to get LASIK eye surgery. It slices your eyeball open. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, I had LASIK eye surgery 12 years ago. It's not a big deal. &gt;&gt; KIM: I haven't even worn contacts because they itch my eyes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you have to do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to do it, Mom, please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They've already advertised you dancing with the Pussycat Dolls. You can't just back out. That's unprofessional, and you'll never be thought of in the same way again. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm going to have a rehearsal and I'm going to look like I'm like, this awful dancer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to pretend like I'm your doctor. This is your eye. And this is how he's going to clamp down your eye. They're going to hold it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Seriously, Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And they-they take a thin layer of the top of her pupil and they lift it up. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, they don't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, Khloe, I can't let you play with like knives and tools. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's exactly why I'm not doing LASIK eye surgery. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're dangerous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, please just call and cancel. Please help me get out of this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: I do the Pussycat Dolls or I go blind. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're doing the Pussycat Dolls, Kim. We have a contract. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nope, nope, nope. &gt;&gt; KRIS: End of story. Kim has always been really stubborn, even as a child. So at the end of the day, I know Kim will come around because what other choice does she have? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that why your clothes don't match 'cause you can't see? &gt;&gt; KIM: Shut up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls, girls, girls, sit down, be good. I'll be a few minutes. Hello. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's Bruce for Dr. Lam. You know you've got to get your annual physical, and I've got to do it again. Unfortunately, there's no one to watch Kendal and Kylie. They're going to have to go along with me. Shouldn't take too long. I'll be back out in a minute. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Be right out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; LAM: How are you, sir? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, my wife says I need a physical, I need a checkup, I need to get whatever I need to get done. Whatever that means. &gt;&gt; LAM: A couple things we should talk about. Any major medical problems that you have? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've had absolutely none. &gt;&gt; LAM: Seem like a pretty healthy guy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Strong heart. &gt;&gt; LAM: I'm looking through your records here. Seems like you haven't had a colonoscopy yet. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been avoiding it. Probably at this point, I probably should. &gt;&gt; LAM: You're over 50 years old now, correct? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I passed that one. &gt;&gt; LAM: The procedure itself lasts about 20 minutes at most. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I hear that the night before is the tough part. &gt;&gt; LAM: Absolutely, yeah. Probably about 100% of the patients say that the bowel prep and the whole clean-out process is really the worst thing about it, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, I got to go for a colonoscopy. I was supposed to go a couple years ago. So I've been putting it off for a while. Well, let's just get it done. &gt;&gt; LAM: Great. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: All right, Mr. Jenner. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you much. It was very nice meeting you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: We'll see you next Friday for your colonoscopy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Stay away from the food the day before. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: No cream in the coffee. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. We are out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Does Dad have colonoscopy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Colonoscopy? Why are you asking me this? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Because... &gt;&gt; KRIS: He doesn't have colonoscopy. He's just really conservative. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, that's what the doctor said. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The doctor didn't say Daddy had colonoscopy, honey. Daddy is very private. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Is it... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And he's very shy. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Is he sick? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, he's not sick like that, okay? Everything's gonna be okay. I'm gonna go have a chat with Daddy. Honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Practicing with my little computerized simulator for my helicopter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what, can I talk to you about something? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendal and Kylie... Well, can you just not play with your helicopter? 'Cause this is important, and I need you to hear what I'm gonna say. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sweetheart, uh, you're gonna make me crash it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sorry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It crashed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. Honey, listen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendal and Kylie think that you have colonoscopy, this new crazy disease. And you need to tell them exactly what's going on with... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want to talk about... That's kind of embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not. Why are you so weird this way? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you're weird. It's weird. You need to sit down with your girls and tell them exactly what you're going to do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'll tell them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, right this way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When the time is right, I'll tell them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When the time is right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, you heard me. The actual colonoscopy procedure is kind of, kind of gross. You know, I don't want to really talk to the girls about it. I'm kind of just putting this thing off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. This is what I look like now when I read at night. These are my new... I'm channeling Alec Baldwin. What do you think? &gt;&gt; KIM: Those are ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? No, I love them. They're fabulous. These are my new glasses. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I'm, like, in love. But you're gonna end up with these all the time if you don't do something to get it together. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a really big deal to me. You know, Robin and I have planned this for a long time. And I just know that in order to have a perfect performance, I definitely need to do LASIK eye surgery. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I think that you really need to get it done. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, I know. I'm gonna do it. This is, like, a one-time thing, and it'll be done with. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, the guy does it all day long. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here we are. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. So today I'm going for my LASIK eye surgery, and I'm gonna bring Kourtney and Khloe along to support me. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: So that's good. Tilt your head back. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are these the numbing drops? &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: These are antibiotic drops first that I'm putting in. The numbing goes in when you're inside. Close your eyes for me. Lean all the way back. Good. Do not open during the time I apply this around the skin, okay? 'Cause if it does get into the eyes, it will irritate. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it hurts. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just let me show you. I'll go, "I love you so much." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't do that to me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Easy. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys are really annoying. I mean, I obviously brought Kourtney and Khloe for support with me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KIM: But they're actually making me more nervous. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay, ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm ready. I'm getting really sleepy. Is that normal? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Good, that's good. We gave you Valium, so you'd be relaxed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I personally think Kimberly is a nut job. She is getting LASIK eye surgery the day before she has to go to Vegas to perform with the Pussycat Dolls. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So we're gonna lie you down on this chair right here, so come have a seat. And, ladies, stay there for just a sec. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good luck, Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good luck, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe and Kourtney, if I hear so much as a "ooh" or "oh" or anything... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, I can't promise you. I might get grossed out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, try your hardest because I'll jump off the table. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I'll try my hardest. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What about... &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Ladies, ladies, I... in all seriousness, I need you to be really quiet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, we will. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will be. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We won't even... You won't even hear us breathe. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Open your left eye now, and look down. Good. Good. And look right at me, Kim. Look in my eyes. &gt;&gt; KIM: It feels like your eye is about to come out of your head. So I go under the machine, and I was like, "Oh, my God, what if my vision never comes back?" &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Good. Very good. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Give it to him easy. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's up, Las Vegas? I'm feeling really dirty tonight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Good. Look right at the flashing light. Good. Doing beautifully. You'll feel me touching your eyelids a bit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's so sick. Khloe and I were cringing, like, about to vomit. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Watch the flashing light. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can they stop? 'Cause I'm not done. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: What's that? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just wanted my sisters to not talk. I just kept on thinking, "It's over soon. It's over soon." Then these noises they're making are freaking me out, so I'm just like, "Shut up." &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Perfect. Great. Right at the flash. Perfect. And, Kim, we are done. That went perfectly. You did just great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I can sit up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sorry, they didn't cut your eyeball off. They just laid it back. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So what'd you think? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's weird. It's weird. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Pretty wild, isn't it? &gt;&gt; KIM: It is. So right after surgery, my vision is way more blurry than what I started out with. And I just hope that I can actually see before my Pussycat Dolls performance. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. What is with the glasses? Is that what they put on you? I don't remember that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God! Don't touch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not in her eyes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come this way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your boobs don't look huge at all, Mom. That's really appropriate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They grew while you were gone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's already seeing double; she doesn't need to see bigger of that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just need to take an Ambien. And I'm shivering 'cause I'm freezing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've got to go to a meeting. I love you, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just really hope that I wake up and things are a little bit more clear. I have to be totally recovered by the time my performance is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you guys talking about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're saying, "What's colonoscopy?" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I didn't want to talk to you about this 'cause it's kind of personal, but... In the other room. Come on. We'll explain. All right, I know you guys have a lot of questions. You're always worried about everything when it comes to my health; I am absolutely fine. Nothing could be better. I'm perfectly healthy. Okay, a colonoscopy is for colon. Your colon is <i>all</i> the way up at the end of your intestines, okay? Where the poopie comes out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew, Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay? So, what they do is they take this <i>long</i> tube, okay? Little thin little-- looks like a little hose, okay? And on the end of it, it's got a camera, and they put you to sleep, and then they slide that baby up your butt, and then they work it <i>all</i> the way up your intestines, <i>all</i> the way to the end, and they look at your colon. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is sick. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you can see all the pictures of all your intestines, what the insides... It's not sick. The tough part is the night before, you got to take this medicine, and it, like, cleans your insides out 'cause you can't have any, you know, poopies there. Okay, so it cleans your inside... That's really probably the toughest part of the whole thing-- is the night before. Okay? You're good? You're okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think so. It was a little too much information for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I wake up, and I can see so clearly, better than I ever have before. The only problem is, it's super slippery and there's gonna be water in the bathtub and I'm gonna have heels on, and I need to practice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is terrible. I got to smell food, and I can't eat. All right, let's do it. The worst part of the colonoscopy: getting prepared for it. Man, does it clean you out. Not bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, can somebody get me some more toilet paper! Please! &gt;&gt; KIM: Tonight is the night with the Pussycat Dolls. I have been practicing a lot, so I think that I'm getting a lot more comfortable in the whole routine, but I'm definitely just anxious to have it over with. Oh, my gosh! ♫ Rain Man suite Rain Man suite ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get off this. &gt;&gt; KIM: ♫ I'm in Caesar's At the Rain Man suite. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is she on? I can't help but think that I'm here in this beautiful Caesar's Palace, and poor Bruce, he's got to do a colonoscopy tomorrow. &gt;&gt; NURSE: Okay, everything off. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Story of my life. The girls are off to Vegas, the Pussycat Dolls, you know? What do I have to do? Good-bye, Rob. &gt;&gt; NURSE: Sorry, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, no worries. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have a heart. I got to do this by myself. &gt;&gt; ROB: Give it to him easy. &gt;&gt; ROB: How did it go? You don't even know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fabulous. &gt;&gt; NURSE: He did great. &gt;&gt; ROB: You drop the soap? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was here just a second ago, and I'm back. I can eat again. &gt;&gt; ROB: What was that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can eat again. &gt;&gt; ROB: They spiked the IV with Patron. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I like that. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have a drink. Let's get this show crack-a-lackin'. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: So, ladies and gentlemen, all right, please put your hands together 'cause we are the Las Vegas Pussycat Dolls! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, this club is so packed. Everybody showed up. It's, like, so much pressure to try to impress, and Kim is actually gonna be the finale tonight, so... Oh, my God, I'm shaking. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I'm walking up to the stage. This is the moment. We've put so much into this. I've done the LASIK. I've tried to rehearse as much as I can with as little time as I've had. If I slip and fall or anything does not go perfectly in this Pussycat Dolls performance, it is gonna be humiliating. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Give it up for Kim Kardashian! &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Give it up for Kim Kardashian! &gt;&gt; KIM: What's up, Las Vegas? I'm Kim Kardashian here at the Pussycat Dolls Lounge. Well, I don't know about you guys, but I'm feeling really dirty tonight, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...I think it's time we take a bath. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim finally takes the stage. The crowd is going crazy. I'm so proud of her. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited to finally be doing it. It's all so surreal. I'm just loving everything that's going on right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim really nails her performance. She does such a great job. I'm so proud of her. She didn't miss a beat. She was just perfect in every way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How was the Pussycat Dolls? &gt;&gt; KIM: Really good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She was amazing. Amazing. She looked like heaven. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You mean, she looked better than my colon? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not really. She kind of looked like your colon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Bruce, look. Look. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What is that? &gt;&gt; ROB: I-I think it's... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, is that it? How'd you get that online? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's on the Internet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew, why do you have those yellow spots? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It looks like an eyeball. &gt;&gt; ROB: They're called blasphemy... blasphemy spots. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're called blood veins and flesh; it's good. Are you all leaving? That's it? &gt;&gt; ROB: We'll see you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just left with me and my colon? &gt;&gt; ROB: Your ass, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My healthy colon? Have a wonderful life! &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Next on <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>with the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: I was approached to launch my own perfume. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's gonna be called Dashing by Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me? I will sue theout of you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you insane? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not stealing your name. You guys are not good businesswomen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't give a &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want you guys to be proud of me; I really do.
