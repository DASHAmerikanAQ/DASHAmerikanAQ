- &gt;&gt; KENDAL/KYLIE: Dad! Dad! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDAL/KYLIE: The fries are burnt! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, calm down. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mom put them in there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, sorry. Are they squished? Oh! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Making some French fries. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you always dressed like that when you make French fries? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going out to dinner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you mean we're going out to dinner? I'm watching the game. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going out to dinner with the Katzes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I thought we had the night off, the-the game is on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was a bad throw. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I wanted to watch the game. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Take me out to dinner, I'm begging. Every time we go out, Bruce makes it feel like so much work. And it just brings me down. Dinner is not drama. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Dinner's drama. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dinner is-- you get dressed, you look nice, you go out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The faster we go, the faster we'll get back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Going to dinner with Grandpa-- this ought to be fun. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, do you like either of these shoes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Those. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And not these, right? <i>944</i> magazine is throwing me a party to honor my first magazine cover. &gt;&gt; Bruce, what if you really start feeling it? What if when T.I. hits that stage...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who's T.I.? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A rapper who... &gt;&gt; A.K.A. "Tip." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, this is going to be really exciting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm looking forward to this. Don't want to go. I know what it's going to be like when I get there. Just stupid people talking. Nothing's going to happen. It's just like a waste of my time. Honey, how are we getting there? Are you going with them? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I will go with you. We're going in this car. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What car? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They have a car for us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I'd just as soon drive myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll go in the car, you drive yourself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you want a car for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause they sent it for us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We can actually drive. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going to take a car. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why would we sit in a car? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because gas is expensive. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Gas is expensive. So are those earrings you're wearing, honey. You can buy a lot of gas. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney's hosting a big <i>944</i> magazine party, 'cause she is the new cover girl. And of course, when one of us is doing something that's really important, we all go in support. So tonight is Kourtney's night. &gt;&gt; PEREZ HILTON: Perez. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know whether to hug you or kill you. Every time we go to these parties, everybody is having so much fun. But I know it's just a matter of time before Bruce is asking me to leave. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you ready? Let's get out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In a minute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, let's get out now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce is just a very mellow guy. He likes to stay home. I think Kris is very selfish when it comes to Bruce's needs and wants. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I've been working with New Wave Fragrances for about a year now, and we're finally getting close to releasing a Kim Kardashian perfume. &gt;&gt; I think between you and your name and your elegance and the product, we could have something really amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Two years ago I trademarked the name "Dashing" in fragrance... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Waiting for this moment. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: All we need to do now is to perfect the scent. I just love it, "Dashing by Kim Kardashian." &gt;&gt; It has a certain ring to it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, you're like, you're always slurping. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Please, Kris. Please, just don't criticize. I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, can I just talk to you about one thing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just feel really bad. Every time you go out with me and the kids... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...or just me, you are just always bored to tears. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am bored. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's sad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Like the other night. It's like a bunch of people running around talking about nothing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's like you're not with the program. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But that's not my kind of program. Sometimes it just drives me crazy. So often, it's not her coming over to me in my life-- it's me going over into her life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You were like sitting in the chair bored. I mean... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was bored. Boring. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want you to have a good time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But I have a good time doing what I want to do, not what you want to drag me to. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, you've got a stick up your ass right now. I got into such a fight with Bruce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because, you know, I'm kind of over him going to every single event with us and being so bored to tears at all times. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He doesn't have to want to go. He's a 60-year-old man. He doesn't have to go to clubs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All he wants to do is play with his helicopter. I'm married to a 60-year-old man who wants to play with his toys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, well, he's married to a 50-something-year-old woman who wants to go to events and clubs. Bruce is like an active guy, and he would rather do active stuff. Well, why don't you do, you know, some Bruce stuff, and if he sees that you're trying, then maybe he'll try. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a good idea. I could. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, I'm going to do some filing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Got it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm at the Givaudan perfumery, where they actually create the scent that will be bottled up. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: So come on back. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lauren, who runs Givaudan, pulled together from our conversations, different scents that she thought that I would love. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: So these are the three they've made for you based on the comments, to make it a little bit stronger, adding a little bit of the Vixen elements into the Velvet Rope. &gt;&gt; KIM: First you come up with the juice that you feel best describes, you know, your personality. I can't smell the green one as much. &gt;&gt; We can add more musk. Musk is very creamy and very sexy, very skin-like. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney and Khloe are going to be so excited. I really hope that after we get my perfume, we can do one for the store. This process for them-- they will love it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, Kim. Did I put too much? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is perfect. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! Good job, everybody. All right, Kim. &gt;&gt; Cheers! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY &amp; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guess what. &gt;&gt; BOTH: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just finished closing a perfume deal for Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What perfume deal? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: With New Wave Fragrances. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The perfume deal that she's doing with New Wave Fragrances. We just closed the deal. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's cool. Well, what's it called? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Her first fragrance is gonna be called "Dashing by Kim Kardashian." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me? Excuse me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's cool, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't think that contradicts itself having our store being called Dash and that we were supposed to have a perfume called "Dash" together? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We thought the first fragrance that Kim would come out with would be "Dashing," and then the second fragrance would be with you girls. We've already discussed it with everybody... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and it's gonna be Dash with the three sisters. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How the hell does that make any sense, "Dashing" and then "Dash"? Seriously. My sisters and I have always said we're gonna do a clothing line together, a perfume line together, a makeup line, everything that has to do with something that we can incorporate into our stores. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think when you have a chance to hear our reasoning and what we have for the whole big picture... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How do they go two years and not mention this perfume deal? Like, that's just shady. When we hang up the phone, Lily says every day, "Have a dashing day." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We need a commission 'cause this is our name as a trio, we trademarked it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, m... You know what? Now you're going too far. You're not getting commissioned on Kim's fragrance deal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, are you? Are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Of course I am, I'm her manager. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course you are. This was how it was supposed to be done from day one, the three of us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And now you come in the picture and you go ahead and you get Kim her own deal first, and then it's the three of us? that Who theis gonna want a secondhand perfume? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I disagree, and I'm usually right on with these feelings. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you're not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I am. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I am. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will sue the out of you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Suing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you insane? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I will sue. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna sue, you're gonna sue me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, I'm gonna sue. I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They came to us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm out of here. sucks. I don't want to have this discussion. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're being really unreasonable, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't give a flyingwhat I'm being. This sucks. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're not joined at the hip, I'm allowed to do whatever I want. You guys are not good businesswomen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you in business with us then? &gt;&gt; KIM: When Mom first told my sisters that I got a perfume deal, they just were so pissed off. I think that we really just need to sit down and talk about this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is the drama about using the name "Dashing"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because Kourtney and I work every single day at the stores, and let Kim take the credit and talk in all the articles about Dash. Everyone thinks Dash is only hers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you guys have to stay united and realize that anything that either one of you does builds the whole Kardashian brand. &gt;&gt; KIM: My sisters just really need to understand that I need to do this perfume on my own, and then it'll lead to a perfume with the three of us. We're working to do-- in my perfume deal-- our second perfume doing a Dash perfume for the store. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want charity work, people. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's no charity work, Khloe. This is a long-term plan that's been discussed. &gt;&gt; KIM: Dash could not get a perfume without me doing my perfume first, and that's what you have to realize. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not true. If they want you, they want you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want us to ride on your coattails? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Are the calls coming in for you to do a perfume? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're really shortsighted if you're going to begrudge Kim from doing this, and we've worked too hard. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, get over yourself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm really sorry you feel this way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Obviously, you leave when you don't want to hear what we have to say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, Kim. We're going. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom and Kim are like this dynamic duo when they get together, and they always leave Khloe and I out of the equation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're so twins. It's amazing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, honey... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hmm? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...these are not easy to fly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris is actually coming over and wanting to do some of the things that I like to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, it's a joystick. I've been waiting for this all my life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, wait, wait, wait. You have no... You really gotta take your time. This is just a little beginner helicopter, but it's kinda scary to put the remote control in her hands. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is it gonna go up? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Pitch and throttle. There you go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm doing it, I'm doing it. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh-oh-oh! The poor... Okay, let me do it again. Let me do it again. I got it. I got it. I got it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wait, wait, what are you doing? No, no, you gotta get it back into the field. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, this is great. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get out of the way. Let it down. Let it down! Now a little bit of gas. A little more, a little more! Now too much! Too much! Into the tree! Give it some gas. Give it some gas. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm crashing! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wait, wait. Maybe I can get it back. Maybe I can get it back. Give it to me. No, that's over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, it lost its little legs. Uh-oh. I hit somebody's car. I'm really sorry. &gt;&gt; I thought it was a bird. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you broke a blade, too, see? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There is absolutely no way she's touching any of my big helicopters, my real expensive ones. It's the end of her helicopter experience. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are we over this top? You like it or no? Are we over it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a little cha-cha-cha. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't even tell Scott 'cause I couldn't even get into it about Kim's doing a perfume when she's calling it "Dashing." I just can't believe that Kim thinks that's okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Screw Kim. I can't believe Mom thinks it's okay. Can I show you how she walked in? "Oh, my God! Guess, guess what I just did today. I just signed the deal. I finalized it and it's done. And the name is 'Dashing.' And, okay." And we're like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So do something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We tried. We were jokingly gonna sue her, but... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're not gonna sue our sister. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't you just make pretend you're suing her? Either send a fake e-mail or call. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you call? You have a guy's voice, and I know you could, like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: His voice is so obvious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but you could disguise it. I know you could do other voices. Kim would know our voice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Call. So we blocked Scott's number, and Kim's gonna have no idea who's calling her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes, hi. I'm looking for Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is she. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is Patrick Bateman from Goldstein &amp; Fuller Law Firm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. How can I help you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What this is regarding is to inform you that Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian have filed a suit against you in regards that you are trademarking the name "Dashing" out of the ordinary into a perfume deal. &gt;&gt; KIM: A subpoena from Dash to me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I get your number and call you back? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, it's Scott's voice. He sounds ridiculous. His accent is going in and out, and the worst part is is that Kim is believing every single thing Scott says. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's shook. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've practiced that before. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you practice that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause that was like you obviously do that to people. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't do much, so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you sit home and prank call people? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I do, huh? Fuhgedaboutit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fughgedabout it, eh? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How ya doin'? This is Pauly Franknuts and I got a subpoena after you, huh? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is Mom. Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Want to tell me what's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just got a call from your sister Kim, who said she got a call from an attorney, and you're going to sue your sister? You better explain right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was a joke, you psychotic &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Talk to my lawyer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you talking about, Kourtney? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi, I'm gonna speak on behalf of Kourtney Kardashian. This is Patrick Bateman from Goldstein &amp; Fuller attorneys offices. Is this Kris Jenner? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott, this is not funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You started this, so until you give up your 20% and give Kourtney and I ten, off. Ta-ta. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, you got to help me with the bike. You got to get the back end, I'll get the front end. It's so long. The one thing I enjoy about mountain biking, the peacefulness. Out there with Mother Nature. Now, let's go! Years ago, Kris had this beautiful tandem mountain bike made. She's been on it maybe twice. She loves working out. This could be pretty good. This might work out. Up this hill, up this hill. Come on. We're not gonna make it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I told you my feet were gonna get stuck. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's get a little speed going, come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want to get speed, you're scaring me. Stop it. You're going too fast, you're going too fast. I'm feeling uncomfortable. And my ass hurts. This cannot be going any worse. Instead of making my husband's day more enjoyable, I actually made it worse. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Once we get to the top, just the view will be worth it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, the only view I've had all day is of your ass. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But it's a cute ass, isn't it, honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, sweetie, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you ready for bed? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yep. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was your day at school? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It was good-- hectic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hectic? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It means that you had a really crazy day. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hectic. Hectic it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Trying to bond with Bruce has been really a failure today, so I know where to go when I need a little silliness in my life. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How was your day, <i>madre?</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it was all right. I'm just kind of a little confused, because I think that Daddy doesn't think I can do things that he likes to do. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Father likes motorcycles. Motorcycle plus hot mama, plus Bruce, equals chemistry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, Kylie makes a good point, because when Bruce and I were first married, he bought me a Harley Sportster. We used to have so much fun. You are brilliant! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys. Want to see my new perfume bottles? If Kourtney and Khloe think that prank calling me is funny, then two can play at this game. I wanted to put these out here and do little testers. I pretty much got the final scent, but I want to test it out with our customers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, can you not come into our store and start placing things on the counter? &gt;&gt; KIM: Your store? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We just cleaned our store and put our counter... &gt;&gt; KIM: This is my store, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We don't want a bunch ofon the counter. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's not gonna be a bunch of There's gonna be a few samples. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For what? &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause I want to test out my new perfume. We have candles, we have water bottles. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but this is not a sample sale. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your perfume with our name? Clearly, stealing our name. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not stealing your name. I'm not stealing your name, I trademarked it two years ago. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You've been keeping this secret for two years from us and not telling us about your...? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're not triplets. We're not joined at the hip. I'm allowed to do whatever I want. You guys are not good businesswomen. You don't know anything about business. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you in business with us then? &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what? You're right, you are so right. I'm gonna talk to Mom and talk to our attorneys and get out of our partnership, because there's no reason why the three of us have to be in business together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ta-ta, see you later. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not worth it, you guys don't get business. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You'll miss us later, honey, when no one else will do your dirty work. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This perfume battle has gotten so out of hand, that I think I need to bring the girls together to have a meeting face-to-face. So I've invited them all to lunch, and they don't know each other's coming, so this ought to be interesting. We have another guest. Hey, Kim. Come on in. All right, listen, you guys. I have a plan. I'm really sick and tired of you guys behaving the way you've been behaving. I can't take it anymore. I'm not gonna be a referee. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom tries to trap us in a room, so we can all be forced to talk. Like, I have nothing to say to Kim right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're not making a lot of headway here. You guys need to be maybe a little bit more mature and work it out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't give a I don't know anything. All I know is someone comes into my store, really energetic. "We just got a perfume done for Kim Kardashian Dashing." What do you want me to do, jump forjoy? For what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, some days, so much happens in a day that I can barely keep up with myself. You know, and I-I just want you guys to be proud of me. I really do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, we are proud of you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't think, like, you are. Every time I try to do something, I feel like one of you is getting mad at me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not mad at you. I feel like you're a mom, just doing all you... Are you... Kourtney, are... I am shocked that Kourtney just starts crying. I, like, never see Kourtney cry. That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really do appreciate my mom. And whenever I see my mom cry, it just makes me sad. I just think this wasn't really explained to us. If you guys would've came at us that way instead of Mom racing in the store, screaming and cheering and how the name is Dashing. That was the first we'd heard of it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, that makes sense. I definitely think both of us, you know, should've communicated better. All of us should've communicated better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I won't let that happen again. I'll keep you in the loop. I feel really bad. I want our family to stay tight-knit. I don't want anything to pull us apart. Let's all do our best. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really don't think this fight was about perfume. I think this fight was about the connection that my sisters and I have. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you, too. I admit that I might have reacted a little too quickly to Kim's perfume deal. But I do know that Kim and my mom have my best interest at heart. Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. I don't like when people cry. Boo-hoo. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, babe, how you doing? Yeah. This woman is up to something, and I don't know what it is. All right, I'll meet you up there. All right, love you. See you in a little bit then. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. I used to ride motorcycles back in the day. And now I just need to remind Bruce that I can really shake it up when I want to. I'm gonna throw you on the back, and now you can ride on the back when I'm driving. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Every relationship develops throughout the years. I got my thing, and she's got her thing. We meet in the middle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I found something that I love to do that you love to do, so we can do this together. I'll take you for the ride of your life. Here we go. I just can't... Here we go. Whoo! This is so great. And I don't know what I was ever worried about. Bruce and I still know how to have some fun. This is a big turn. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're going too fast. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not going too fast. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brake, brake, brake! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yee-ow! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Next on <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>With the Kardashians.</i> I am adopted. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe needs a DNA test. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! Let's get a DNA test. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, what are you doing?! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm not a stranger to tattoos. I've always been wanting to get another one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My God, calm down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shut up, Khloe! When you have a son with a tattoo the size of Alabama on his chest! It's not okay!
