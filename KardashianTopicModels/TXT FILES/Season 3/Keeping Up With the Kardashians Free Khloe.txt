- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello, Mother. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, you guys. How was the trip? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was so much fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was so much fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to show you some pics. That's the opera house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, look. That's a great shot. Look at that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's the koala bear that attacked Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look! It's attacking her! Look at its nails right there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. It scared me so badly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's worse than Bruce's manicure. You guys want something to eat? You must be starving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you know that I got kicked out of my DUI class while I was in Australia? Two years ago I did something stupid: I got the DUI. &gt;&gt; OFFICER: 'Kay, do me a favor. Step out of the car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And it seems like every year rolls around and the anniversary of Daddy's death, and I think everybody doesn't know how to deal with their grief, including myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a long process, and I just feel bad that I have to put everybody through this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, how do you get kicked out of a DUI class? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because I missed two consecutive weeks in a row by going to Australia. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, if you're okay today, Khloe, you should probably go get that taken care of right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have to make a court appointment. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So go make one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It says, "Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch some more." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wine made after your own heart. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So guzzle it up. Guzzle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! Is that what happens when you give Bruce? Is that the noise you make? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, don't even say that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's so sick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To imagine Mom and Bruce having sex is disgusting! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to go make a call, so you get on that right now. Don't make me worry about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The sex master is here! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Take care of the DUI! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take care of your sex! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just, like, hate going to court, in general, like, even if... I literally just have to go in, get an extension from the judge, and then we should be done. My best friend Malika is driving me to court. Whew! It's <i>caliente</i> in this bitch. All I need is an extension from the judge and I'll be fine, so... I don't think it'll be that big of a deal. I don't get it. My judge is not very happy with me. And I'm kind of, like, in a state of shock. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's really unreal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He thinks that my job is a luxury and that there's no excuse on why I got kicked out. So I now have to serve 30 days in jail. I don't know how I'm gonna tell my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guess who's going to jail on the 18th? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why would they send you to jail, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not lying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't go to jail on a first offense. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not lying about it, Mom. Why would I lie about something like this? Seriously? Do you think that's.. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not calling you a liar, Khloe; it's just shocking that it has come to this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What the? It is what it is. I cannot go and analyze every situation; I'm going to jail. I could have gone without you even knowing, but now I have to stress out more because now youris making a bigger deal about what it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Any mother would react like crazy if their daughter calls them and says, "Hi. I'm going to jail." How do you think I feel? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, how do you think <i>I</i> feel? Like, ugh! I just got to go. I can't even deal with this. I've got to go. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Call me. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm sorry, Khloe, but you're wrong. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, the stress. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: How else do you expect her to react? She's your mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. I want to talk to you first. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't even want to be there when Bruce receives this news because I honestly don't know how he's gonna take it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did get arrested before... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...in '07. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The DUI. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So now on Friday, I have to go to jail. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's telling you congratulations, you're going to jail? It's not a joke. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't think it was a joke. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She got sentenced to 30 days in jail. Khloe and Bruce are so casual about her sentence that it's sort of shocking to me. Because as a mom, it just weighs really heavy... on my heart. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm sorry, my little Khloe. This is like <i>The Neverending</i> <i>Story.</i> You know, she's a good kid, made a mistake. She's gonna have to pay for it. It's gonna be very difficult on her, but I can guarantee you she's never gonna have this problem again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It says, "Is she drunk? Khloe Kardashian is due to check in to jail this Friday for violating her probation, but before that, she's gonna party it up." I mean, people are just retarded. The stories that the tabloids are writing, they're so bizarre and crazy and elaborated. ♫ ♫ I have a drinking problem, and now I'm an alcoholic. I just need to go to rehab. It's, like,off, get a life. The press. Out of everything from this DUI, that's probably been the hardest thing for me. It just bothers me 'cause I feel like there's no way for me to redeem myself; there's no way for me to be, like, "I'm not an alcoholic." &gt;&gt; KRIS: All of us are under enormous stress. As a mom, I've never had a child go to jail before. It's weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, listen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We don't know how to act. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's weird for all of us. It's especially weird for me. It's happening to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes, you know, I just wish Daddy was here because he probably could give us all a lot of really good advice. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom... Anytime my dad is brought up, his name is brought up, a picture, my mom gets extremely emotional. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you're just making things harder. You just shouldn't talk about that right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just sad. You know, this is one of those times when I just wish that he was around to kind of tell us what to do. My ex-husband, Robert Kardashian, who passed away five years ago, was an ace lawyer, and I really feel like if he was alive today, we wouldn't be going through any of this. Tomorrow's gonna be a long day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not right to do. Khloe's going to jail. You're gonna make her feel bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I have a moment I get really sad when I think about Daddy, and this is just, like, overwhelming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I can't think... I'm sorry, but I can't think about Dad about this. I just can't even fathom the thought of Dad knowing that I'm going to jail. I mean, I love my mom, but come on, please, just, like, don't do this to me right now. Do not suck me into your little emotional train that you're going on. Oh, I can't think about Dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'll do my best to keep my emotions in check. Oh... it's all right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're doing okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. Today I'm going to jail, and I just want to get it over with and never have to worry about it again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: TMZ is stationed at every gate with their cameras. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is kind of serious. We have ten minutes... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, suck my! &gt;&gt; KIM: I think all of us just are trying to be as calm as we can for Khloe. But I think at this point my mom is a wreck. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We could go to, like, IHOP. If we get really close and we have a whole bunch of time, do you want to have breakfast? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What up? Were you not gonna call me to say ta-ta? What am I talking about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your sister's going to jail. Have a little compassion. Kim, would you stop taking pictures of yourself? Your sister's going to jail. &gt;&gt; KIM: We need the effect of everyone on what we're doing... right while Khloe's gone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here, Kim, this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like I'm gonna barf. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. Throw up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ready? &gt;&gt; How's it going, Khloe? &gt;&gt; Going to jail-- how long you gonna be in there, Khloe? Been drinking this morning, Khloe? &gt;&gt; Did you ask Paris for any advice? &gt;&gt; Khloe, right over here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now I'm getting freaked out. Swarms of paparazzi are starting to come. &gt;&gt; Khloe, Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the last thing I want to have to worry about and have in my face. &gt;&gt; Any advice for the youth of America? &gt;&gt; There's no happy hour where you're going. &gt;&gt; Khloe, Khloe! &gt;&gt; Turn around. Can I get one here? &gt;&gt; Kris, Kris! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I never thought I would be walking into a courthouse to surrender my daughter, you know, to stay in jail. It was so surreal. &gt;&gt; Kris, how do you feel about your daughter going to jail? &gt;&gt; KRIS: All these memories are swarming around in my head of the O.J. Simpson trial. After our divorce, my ex-husband was on O.J. Simpson's defense team. And Nicole was one of my dearest friends. Was probably one of the hardest things that I'll ever go through in my whole life. &gt;&gt; Khloe, you worried? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because it tore my family apart. It did, it caused a lot of friction between Robert and I. &gt;&gt; Good luck. Be strong. &gt;&gt; Cheers to you, Khloe. &gt;&gt; Khloe, Khloe! &gt;&gt; Is the justice system fair? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Shawn, we were just getting a little anxious about Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: Now that Khloe's gone, my mom just is all freaking out. She doesn't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Inside, it's just eating me alive not knowing exactly what's happening with Khloe. We're just trying to wait it out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, towards the end, he really wouldn't swallow food, you know. And all he wanted was my cream of wheat, and he could not, like, hardly talk, and he'd be like, "Cream of wheat. You make me cream of wheat." And I'd be like, "I got you." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Robert and I were obviously on two separate sides, um, of the O.J. Simpson trial. &gt;&gt; Congratulations. &gt;&gt; Hi, Debbie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I think that it made it really tough for me to be nice to him on certain days because I was so angry about what was going on. Khloe, are you okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe is going to be released, due to overcrowding, and we just like... we really can't believe it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so... I'm just hyperventilating. Kim, let's roll. Come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here she comes to save... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't be weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe walks up those steps, and I've never seen a more beautiful face in my entire life. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo, put your hands closer together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your shoelaces are gone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They didn't want me to hang myself. I was only at Lynwood for about three hours, but you don't want to go there. It's not fun. Like, being in there for 30 days, I would have died. They, like, search you and, like, touch yourand everything. It's so odd. I mean, over your clothes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do they do it inside? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, they just have to make sure you're not, like, holding anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That wasn't stressful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney's under more stress than you are from hanging out with you that long. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you celebrating tonight? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I only have one word for tonight: vodka. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'd say, don't say that to Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have a drinking problem! I can't drink and drive. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm out of prison, and I'm so happy to be out. I just want to eat, and then bathe. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Can I have a wine list? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Yes. Let me get it for you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: We're celebrating. &gt;&gt; WAITER: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're actually numbing. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah, really. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not in the mood to drink, but my mom and Kourtney decide to order rounds of shots for everyone. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Kourtney, if you take it, I'll take it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh,! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Little Miss Kourtney gets soup. Like, how appropriate is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The officers were really, really sweet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tell him what happened. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe got &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She gotin the butt, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, shut up! I just got out of jail for a DUI. I can't be surrounded by drunk people right now. So, is everybody ready to leave? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who says you can't swallow twice? Who said that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, that ain't funny. No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just hate... like, these things are ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, here it says, "Khloe Kardashian served her jail sentence in record time." &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY AND KHLOE: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We've been reading all these stories about Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm an alcoholic. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so depressing. Makes me not want to even lift a finger. I've been out of jail for a couple days, but, you know, I don't really want to go out and give people anything else to say about me. It's... it's not worth it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, I'm starving. When I'm feeling funky about something, one of the people that I always find great comfort in talking to is my mom. I just... I... I feel like I'm going through these weird feelings, you know, concerning Robert Kardashian, you know. And every time his name comes up, I get really, you know, sentimental and... &gt;&gt; MOTHER: I know you do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Emotional. &gt;&gt; I mean, I still feel that way about Papa, that, you know, I didn't spend enough time there, and, you know, everybody goes through that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel so desperately guilty about the fact that I wasn't there enough in the end when he passed away, like there was something I could have done. I was the one who initiated the divorce, and Robert was really unhappy about it. It's probably one of my biggest, biggest regrets of my life, but after the O.J. Simpson trial, he got really, really sick, and I never really got the opportunity to express to him the way I actually felt, so I feel like I really let him down. &gt;&gt; I don't think so, Kris. I don't really... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I did. &gt;&gt; We let people down, but they come back up and they still love us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How did this happen? How is it that he's gone? &gt;&gt; It is not your fault, sweetheart. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like it is. I just wish that I could come to a place where I was okay with these feelings. &gt;&gt; You need to talk to him. Talk to him and say, "I hope you forgive me" 'cause I talk to Harry all the time. You've got to let it go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean, you're not going out? You don't have to, like, drink and go crazy. You can get dressed up and look cute and go out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to deal with it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, you have to just, like, own up to it. The thing about Khloe is she's so tough on the outside, but on the inside, she's way more sensitive than people think. &gt;&gt; KIM: You need to face it, get it over with and not worry about what people are going to say. You just cannot live your life that way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: At least start by going out for, like, dinner or something. &gt;&gt; KIM: We want to go out, we go out. We want to go to dinner, we go to dinner. We want to do whatever we want to do, we do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know I'm not a bad person. I know I don't have a drinking problem. Kim's right. I should go out. I should enjoy my life. Love you, ladies, whoo! I don't need to sit at home all night doing nothing, bored out of my mind. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You hear that music? &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: You guys been drinking tonight? Khloe, have you been drinking? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your questions don't get old at all. I shouldn't be afraid of what the paparazzi's gonna say. They're gonna talk, regardless. Not getting into the driver's seat. I mean, you're such a loser. Go away. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you guys, I've been talking to Grandma, and I'm just really struggling with a lot of stuff, and I wanted to see how you guys were feeling about me going to visit Daddy's grave. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's been almost five years, and with everything going on with you girls, it seems to be really more present all the time. I can't really resolve, and I just think I need to... pay him a visit, that's all. &gt;&gt; KIM: My dad, I think, to the day he passed away, was always in love with my mom, and I think my mom always knew that. And, you know, I think she felt guilty inside over it. I know that she probably needs to do this just for herself. I think it's a good idea. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think the idea sucks. I do not think that I want to remember my dad laying in grass, where there's a plaque that says "In Loving Memory." I don't choose to listen to this conversation. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so don't partake. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I'm not. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just why are you being so, like, judgmental about it? She's not asking you to go with her. If you don't want to go, you don't have to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's asking for my opinion; I think it's a stupid idea. I think you're going to go there and make yourself cry more. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe that's good for you. Maybe you should go there and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I always have to hold my feelings in because you guys are always so critical if I just even say one word. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It just upsets us when you get emotional, and that's why... &gt;&gt; KRIS: But you're mean about it. I just think that you make fun of me, Kourtney, and it's not nice, and Khloe, you're just disrespectful. You know what, all of you think about what you say to people because it's very hurtful, and I'm done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Think about what you say to people because it's very hurtful, and I'm done. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys are honestly so rude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Wh-Why's that good that you're rude to your mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think no matter how you lose someone or how long you loved them, the loss is still profound and unbearable. To come here is symbolic 'cause it's a place where I can find some closure, do something that I've been struggling with for the last five years. I think that you go through life, and... you don't want to have any regrets. But I think that the one thing I wish I could take back in many ways was getting a divorce. It was a very selfish thing to do when I looked back on it. And I'm so sorry for... you know, ruining that perfect union that we had. I feel like you still probably carried some of that pain with you when you got sick, and the one thing that I'll never be able to change is that I wasn't there for you. And I'll always live with that guilt and that pain, but I came here todayto leave it here so that I can go home and be a good mom and a good wife. And I'm really sorry. And I'll always love you. And I just want all of us to find peace. It was like the most freeing thing that I have done. It was something I needed to do to move on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Krissy! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kriss Jenner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and I send our most sincerest apology. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim's right: we should let you have an outlet to talk about things. We should be there for you like you're there for us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Finally. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really glad that Kourtney and Khloe have apologized to my mom because I just don't think sometimes they realize how difficult and harsh they are with her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you guys with all my heart. You're my whole life. You really are. And we've all lost something that connected all of us. The best thing of all is that he gave us all-- look what I have-- the four of you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everybody in life has a history, and you know, sometimes it's really difficult to deal with things in the past. And Kris deals with that all the time, especially with her ex-husband. We've talked about it a lot throughout the years, and I know, you know, the more she talks about it, probably the better it gets. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want you guys to know that I'm really trying to be there for you, and every time you're there for me, it means the world. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to be more there for you... &gt;&gt; KIM: Another hugger, but I'll give you a hug. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you guys. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: This season on <i>Keeping Up with the</i> <i>Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm feeling really dirty tonight. &gt;&gt; I wasn't raised with a maid like you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Push in the tush! Push in the tush! I was at a boy's house. Why do you care? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're going camping. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm Reggie! I love you so much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to move to New York. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want you to grow and conquer. I just want you to do it in L.A. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're doing this PETA thing, don't you think you should lose a few pounds? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is such a joke. All you care about is Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you punish me. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, are you not good businesswomen? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I will sue the out of you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; So does that mean you're engaged?
