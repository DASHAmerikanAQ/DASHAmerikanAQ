- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lately, Kourtney's been talking a lot how she wants to expand the store. We feel like we've made our niche, like, in Calabasas. Let's move on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think we should just, like, open up another store in L.A.? 'Cause I did get a call from the Plaza Hotel in New York. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She wants Miami. And who knows, but I do think it is a good idea, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Rob. You broke up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who broke up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who broke up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Put it on speakerphone. Kim, put it on speaker. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But why? What-what happened? You guys were fine a couple days ago. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Always running back to your sisters. &gt;&gt; KIM: I get a phone call from Rob, and he's in tears. He just doesn't want to talk about it, he just wants to get my approval that he can move in with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, load up your car and come over to my place. &gt;&gt; ROB: I got to get going. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Was he crying? &gt;&gt; KIM: He sounded like it at first, and then he got it together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's get going. I want to go talk to Rob. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm hungry. &gt;&gt; KIM: What happened? Wait, tell us. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's no, like, drama. It's not, like, bad. She's moving to New York, so it's better that I just graduate and figure my life out here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I love you very much, you can obviously live with me, but I have some rules. And I'm gonna take you around and show you what my rules are. All right, so let's go, and I'll show you. I definitely will manage, having Rob there. He's my baby brother, and I wouldn't have it any other way than have him live with me, but it definitely will be a little bit tricky, 'cause I'm so picky and so particular. 'Kay, starting off in the kitchen, everything in here-- like, the soda cans, someone had a soda and this Pepsi's turned the wrong way. It all has to be this, and then we have to move these forward. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is gonna be a disaster. A disaster. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here's the laundry room. These are the candles that I like to use. The green flavor, the pink flavor and the white flavor. All the rest, you can use. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: So green, pink, white-- mine. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim is psycho, literally. I don't even know what to say, she's just crazy. My stay with Kim definitely isn't permanent. &gt;&gt; KIM: These towels are white, and I don't want them to get dirty. All my stuff has to be dry-cleaned. This kind of drapes over the side. This chair right here, it's, like, I don't want it covered up. I mean, I know you just put that there. All right. &gt;&gt; ROB: I appreciate you letting me stay here for now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. Oh, you're welcome. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROB: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls! Come on! You can't be late for school. Let's move it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm coming. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where's Kylie? Hold it, hold it, hold it... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, that's not gonna work. Look at the makeup on you. You got eyeliner on, you got lipstick on, this and that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad, everyone wears makeup. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're in sixth grade. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad! We're gonna be late... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, we're gonna be really late, 'cause you're gonna go in that house right now and you're gonna wash your face. You hear me? Go wash your face. You're not getting in the car. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They don't even allow makeup in sixth grade! All this makeup, the hair, the outfits. Kylie's only 11 years old. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, what are you doing here? You're gonna be late for school. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad's making me and Kendall late because he thinks I'm wearing too much eye makeup, so I have to take it off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, okay, well, so hurry it up. Let's get downstairs, get in the car, let's go! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, you're no help, either. Will someone just be on my side for once? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, let's go. He's always gonna be old-fashioned. Get downstairs and don't forget your backpack. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like the appropriate age to wear makeup is my age, middle school. None of the other girls' parents at school or teachers care if anybody wears makeup. But <i>my</i> dad... yeah, he cares. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, come on. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is totally normal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She has red lips. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 11-year-olds don't wear red lips. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have a lot of guy friends, and I hate how my dad always makes such a big deal out of it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who are you talking on the phone with? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dylan. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Give me the phone. Give me the phone. This is Kylie's dad. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad, that's so embarrassing... Why does my dad always embarrass me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I love this. This is really cool. I love this, too. I travel so much that I don't have the time to pick out my outfit sometimes, so my stylists, Monica and Angela, come over and put these outfits together. We can do this for Chelsea Handler, this for <i>Extra.</i> But I want to, like, put little tags on them and say exactly what event they're for. We label them. We put the jewelry and the accessories with the top and the skirt. It's a long process. This is so perfect for the, um, <i>TV Guide</i> party, 'cause it's, like, that sexy party, it's spring now. Ooh, I love that jeweled beaded belt-- I've been dying to wear it. Okay, yes, that's what I'm gonna wear. Oh, my God, I love this. It's so sexy, and it's the <i>"TV</i> <i>Guide</i> Sexiest People." I love this. Let's, like, put it all together with exactly how I'm gonna wear it. You can mark, like, <i>"TV Guide</i> party," like... All right, perfect! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes! Another carpool done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How late did you make the girls? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't make them late at all, but they were about 20 minutes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, they can't show up for school when you want them to show up for school. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie spent an hour in there on her hair and makeup. I mean, it's just... she's 11 years old-- this is absolutely ridiculous. Kendall, she's fine. She doesn't wear makeup, she doesn't care, she just wants to ride her horse. Kylie is the problem. Kylie is the problem. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie is not a problem. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's 11 years old. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It doesn't mean she's gonna be a problem child because she's 11 years old. Kylie's a girly girl. She likes experimenting with clothes and with jewelry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's plenty of time in life for hair and makeup and boys and all these types of things, lots of time. You don't have to do it now. Sorry. I'm the dad. I make the decisions here. No boys, no makeup-- she's way too young for this stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's play, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not when she goes out that way, it's not play. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I'm not gonna allow that stuff to happen. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Kim. I am so not excited... &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, you're wearing... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, sorry, I had to borrow your shirt last night. I had to. &gt;&gt; KIM: But... it's in the section that my stylist set up specifically... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You never told me there are sections. I borrow your stuff all the time. &gt;&gt; KIM: &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I need to borrow something right now, 'cause I'm going to the movies and I just want to be casual. Can I borrow a sweater or something? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but just please tell me which one, so that you're not, like, wearing... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't care which one, as long as it buttons down and covers my ass when I'm wearing leggings. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney thinks that my house is a bus stop. Every time they go out anywhere on this side of town, my house is just the stop-off place where they can leave their stuff, borrow stuff. I just think Kourtney's taking advantage of it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What about this cream one on the top that has brown buttons? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I've never worn that before. I just got that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What about this colorful one that looks like Missoni? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's way too big. You won't like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What about the red and white striped one? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, that's cashmere and I don't want you to ruin it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. Okay, so, tell me which one. I don't care. I just need... I'm going to the movies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just take whichever one, Kourtney. I need you to, like, dry clean it and have it back here because... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I always dry clean it. &gt;&gt; KIM: But, like, a week later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm late for the movies now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, I've never worn that before. I've never... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, I have to go. I'm late for the movies. I've asked you 100 sweaters and you will not give me an answer. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have to go or I'm going to be late. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want the respect. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't get people that are so selfish like you. It's disgusting to be related to you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I pissed <i>you</i> off? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Seriously, I'm going to have to leave. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want anything to drink, a snack? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Fix me up something good. Every time something frustrates me in the family and I have no one to talk to, I usually call Khloe because she's, like, the best sister ever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have a lot of homework? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Math. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why did you want to come here to do it? What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 'Cause Dad's being annoying. I was wearing a little eyeliner and he was like, "Oh, go take it off." Blah, blah, blah. It really frustrates me that my dad always treats me like a baby, 'cause I'm not. I'm almost a teenager. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See, I don't think it's bad because I know your friends wear it and you don't wear, like, a lot of makeup. Like, do you know Kimberly and Kourtney used to wear black lip liner with, like, nude lips and, like, they used to go crazy. I found out Kylie was wearing just, like, a little eyeliner and I was like, "Kylie, I didn't wear makeup till I was in the sixth grade." And she was like, "Hello? I am in the sixth grade." And I was like, "Oh, then you can wear that." I mean, all this stuff is natural. Okay, so do your homework. You need help with math? I'm really good at math. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'll wash my hands. They're really sticky. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really don't know any of this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just going to borrow a shirt 'cause I'm going to dinner with my friends and I need a cuter shirt. &gt;&gt; ROB: You should probably ask Kim. Did you ask? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm going to tell her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've been wearing this all day and I'm on this side of the hill. Why would I drive all the way back to Calabasas? &gt;&gt; ROB: Just so you know that she has, like, her certain outfits. Kourtney walks in and just takes one of Kim's brand new outfits that, like, her stylist just had and, like, if I was Kim, I would be furious. Seriously, if I get in trouble for this... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why would you get in trouble? If Kim came over, I would, like, let her take anything she wants, even if it's new. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm just covering my ass because I know she'll yell at me. She always yells at me for the dumbest things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, new Chanel. Fabulous. &gt;&gt; ROB: I especially tell Kim whenever Kourtney comes in there, I always tell Kim. I tell Kim... I'm a tattletale, that's what I am. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, tell her. Ta-ta! &gt;&gt; ROB: You are not... I'm not touching you. You are trouble. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, we probably should order. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll wait a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; WAITER: We'll give your guests a few more minutes to join us? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll wait. Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Sorry we're late. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where were you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, Kylie. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look beautiful tonight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Doesn't she look gorgeous? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are a superstar. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie and I had a little bonding day today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie's a really strong little girl. She's our little angel. We couldn't ask for anything better, but at the same time, Kylie's not going to roll over and play dead for anybody. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, that is so gross. You just drenched it in butter. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's dressed like a 30-year-old and eating like an 11-year-old. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm meeting my friends Jonathan and Simon for dinner who do amazing PR in New York and they're actually opening an office here in L.A. soon. I didn't know Kim was coming. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm always invited with Jonathan and Simon. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Kim's automatic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I thought you had a business dinner with Mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney shows up with my purse. She knows it's my favorite Chanel bag. Nice purse. Are you putting my purse on the floor? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't need to borrow your bag. Like, I have plenty of my own bags. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you don't need to borrow it, why did you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't have one with me that matched my outfit. My bag was navy. Kim and I are so different. I would let her borrow any of my stuff. Whatever I have, I don't care, she can borrow. So, I think it's just really frustrating that she gets so angry at some bag. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why are you being so quiet all of a sudden? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim just pisses me off. &gt;&gt; KIM: I pissed you off? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Did you tell her you were taking... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I didn't know she was going to be here, to be honest. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not appropriate. Kylie should not be dressed like that. You're dressed like a 30-year-old. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 13 going on 30. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I don't like it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've got to deal with your kids growing older. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. She's 11 years old. And she shouldn't be wearing all that makeup. She shouldn't be wearing that outfit, and that's the bottom line. It's over. It's done. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My friend Dylan likes the way I dress. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everybody's jumping on me like it's my problem. It's not my problem. It's Kylie's problem. She's got too much makeup on. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How old was Kourtney when she got a boob job? Mom? How old were you when you got a boob job? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, we're leaving. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We just started eating. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I'm done. Kylie, come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, stop. Come on. You're going to make a scene. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm not making a scene. Not only is she wearing all this makeup, but all of a sudden, her attitude is changing, too. That's not good. Right now. Let's go. I don't care what everybody else is saying. I'm going to do it the right way. I'm going to get her out of here. Khloe, let her out. Come on. We're out of here. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wow. Oh, my God. What is that? &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: This is the snapper. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is what I ordered? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. So, what events do you have coming up this week, Kour? What are you going to? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to know, so I can lock up my closet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ba-dum-bum! &gt;&gt; KIM: This new hairdo with the little braids is very different. Who'd you steal the style from? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm going to find my watch inside. &gt;&gt; KIM: And my purse. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's going to be a Kourtney beehive. Kour, where are you going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Be right back. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are you going with my purse? Where's my purse going? &gt;&gt; SIMON: Psychos, you went totally ballistic on her. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She stole your purse 'cause she didn't think you were going to be here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. That's, like, the whole point. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Simon, you're a thief. That's my fish! Turn around for one minute, he Kourtney-ed my fish. Oh, my God, she's back. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, you're stealing some more? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's mine and I don't need your bag. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't need to borrow your stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, come on. We're kidding. Stop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now I have my own bag. &gt;&gt; KIM: Take the purse. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. I don't want it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Take the purse. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I will never again borrow your stuff. I don't get people that are so selfish like you. It's disgusting to be related to you. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're joking. I just wanted her to know that it's not okay. She can't just show up and meet me, and not even acknowledge the fact that she has all my stuff on and my bag. Seriously, it's not fun anymore. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to leave. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, please go. Please go. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not fun anymore. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We didn't get dessert yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: And now you're humiliating me having to carry two purses, though. &gt;&gt; SIMON: Make light of that. Have dessert. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You can't leave before we have dessert. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I can. And I am going to. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Do something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. She's the one making fun of me. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She's totally kidding, though. &gt;&gt; SIMON: I mean, it totally like escalated way out of proportion. Over a stupid purse. It's like embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad hates me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean Dad hates you? Sooner or later she's just going to get really angry with you and rebel. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was awkward. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That was terrible. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and I have had these problems though, like, literally-- forever. Like starting in, like, sixth grade or something, we'd just share clothes. This one time, I was in eighth grade and Kim was in seventh grade and Kim, we shared this one pair of jeans. Like one weekend was mine, one weekend was Kim's. And then it was my weekend and she took the jeans. So I made my nanny, like, drive me to her school. And I went into Kim's classroom in the middle of class, and I was like, "My sister stole my jeans..." &gt;&gt; SIMON: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "...and I need to get them back immediately." And I, like, was screaming. &gt;&gt; SIMON: You pulled a Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In front of her entire class. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This story, by the way, it sounds very familiar. It's what happened tonight, except with a bag 20 years later. Are you kidding? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, it actually is. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you kidding me? You started this game. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, bye, dolls. &gt;&gt; SIMON: Bye. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Where's my car? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right there-- my car's right there. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Bye, honey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: So good to see you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SIMON: Thank you for an exciting dinner. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Let me just check to make sure I have my wallet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, what are you doing in here, honey? It's time to get up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad hates me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean Dad hates you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He grounded me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Daddy doesn't hate you, Kylie. Daddy just wants you to grow up to be a perfectly fabulous young lady, and he thinks that perfectly fabulous young ladies don't wear makeup to school. Would it make you feel better if I talked to Daddy? Yeah? Okay. I love you. Don't be sad. I still get to kiss you, even though you're growing up. I love you. Honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you grounded Kylie? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For what? I don't get it. You need to tell me what your thought process is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, parenting is not always easy, okay? I don't want to be like their best friend. No. If you just let your kid do anything, they have no respect for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie's just growing up. And you're going to push her away so dramatically and not let her really kind of experiment and be herself with these little things. Sooner or later she's just going to get really angry with you and rebel. And you have to learn the difference between a little girl growing up and trying to find her way and having a little fun, and really being in trouble. If you keep doing this to her, she's going to rebel. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. Remember when Khloe snuck out of the house? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do remember when Khloe snuck out of the house. See, they're all going to do something to mess up. And we just have to be there to pick them up at the end of the day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Go tell her I'm, uh, she's not grounded any longer. But I want to talk to her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, that's cute. &gt;&gt; MONICA: It's perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: I like that. Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Kourt. Thought you were mad at me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I, um... &gt;&gt; KIM: You couldn't resist. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm definitely not the girl that apologizes. I hate apologizing. I just always like to think that I'm right about everything. I realized that I could be a little nicer about borrowing your stuff and maybe not just taking without asking, and taking your new stuff that you haven't even worn yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would let you wear it as long you just asked, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe I'll be a little nicer and ask. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney walks in as I'm getting ready for the <i>TV Guide</i> party, and at first I think she's just coming over to borrow another outfit. But she actually is coming over to apologize, which is really rare for Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I decided to come to the event with you tonight. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I didn't want you to go alone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, for being so nice, let me let you borrow an outfit, 'cause that dress is hideous, honey. I'm excited that Kourtney's going to come with me now to the <i>TV Guide</i> party, because who wants to go to a party by themselves? It's to die for. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, that is fab. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't it? It's way more you, so you should wear this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love this. &gt;&gt; KIM: By me letting Kourtney borrow this dress, I hope that Kourtney realizes that I would share anything with my sisters. It's just the principle and the respect factor that I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can find something else to wear. Okay, Monica. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's get ready. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; Kim, look over your shoulder. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney looks amazing in this dress. It definitely suits her better than me. I'm so happy that she can wear this and look amazing. &gt;&gt; One more time, ladies. Get real close, real close. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can we talk? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've seen a lot of girls grow up. I know the process, I know how it works. But Kylie-- she's still my little girl. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just don't think you understand that since I'm your last one, that everyone grows up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I understand you're growing up, and I don't mind. Just a little bit of eyeliner is fine, maybe a little... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And talking to my friends? You're a boy. You were a kid once. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't get carried away with all that stuff, that's all I can say. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I promise that I won't grow up too fast. But you have to promise that you will accept that I grow up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I can live with that. But I'm still going to be watching you. Kylie is just a smart, good little girl.
