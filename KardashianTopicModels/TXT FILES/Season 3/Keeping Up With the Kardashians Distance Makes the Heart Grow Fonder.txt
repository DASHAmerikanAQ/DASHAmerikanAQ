- &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Previously on <i>Keeping Up with the</i> <i>Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, I love the store; I'm so passionate about it, but sometimes it does get boring. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Dash. I would love to just do something creative. &gt;&gt; KIM: These have got to go. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: No. I like those. &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe... &gt;&gt; REGGIE: I like those. &gt;&gt; KIM: These have a flower garden with some doves. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: You're not gonna see that. The shirt's gonna be... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, but then why do you like them? &gt;&gt; REGGIE: <i>Because</i> they're blue jeans. &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie and I have been together a little over a year and a half. We're in a strong, committed relationship. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Did you really leave this salad sitting here all day? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I forgot about it. Sorry, babe. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Come on, Kimberly. Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, shut up. He lives in New Orleans, and I live in L.A. We used to see each other a lot more, but because of my schedule, it's gotten a little tough to see each other and spend that quality time, but I guess that's the price that you have to pay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What, a town hall meeting? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, did you know we're going to New Orleans? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're gonna cheer the Bush on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie really wants me to be there for his first game. He needs the support. It's like, a really big deal to him, and if I go, he says I'm his, like, good luck charm. He said if I go and they lose, then I'll be, like, the bad luck charm of all time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, I get asked the question all the time: Does having sex hurt your performance on the athletic field? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Please don't answer; we don't want to know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The only time it's gonna hurt is if you do it during the competition. &gt;&gt; KIM: What?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then it slows you down. After that... before and after it's fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bush in the tush! Bush in the tush! Bush in the tush! Bush in the tush! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wasn't Kim's booty so much more jiggly? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Why is it not jiggly anymore? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause Kim is becoming anorexic. Before it used to hang out of her jeans. Remember it used to, like, roll over? And now look: it's not even. Nothing. There's nothing going on. This is, like, a boring piece of ass. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! Slap it, slap it, slap it, slap it... BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it. We're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, babe. I miss you. You are so cute. See that face? That's the smile I know and love. We need to... I'm just kidding. Um... babe, you know your brother's birthday party? I don't think I'm gonna be able to come. I have this photo shoot, and it's for this magazine, and it's a cover, and it's a really big deal, and I just... I really have to do it. Thank you, babe. Thanks for understanding. So much is going on. My life is so crazy busy. I'm doing everything from great photo shoots in magazines, another calendar, my shoe company with Robert Shapiro, Shoe Dazzle; I just finished filming a movie; my career is just on the up and up, and I've got this momentum going. So no matter what it is in my life-- Reggie, you know, my friends-- right now everyone's gonna have to understand that I am on this train that's not gonna stop. I need to be dedicated and focused at my career right now. All right, babe, I love you. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This castle's amazing. Look at this castle. That's where I should be living. Hey, Beth. &gt;&gt; BETH: Hey, Khloe. What's up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not much. What are you doing? My publicist Beth calls me and offered me this amazing opportunity to go to New York and host a fashion show. &gt;&gt; BETH: Oral-B is the sponsor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BETH: And it's actually during Fashion Week. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In Fashion Week, like New York Fashion Week? &gt;&gt; BETH: Yeah, and they want you to come and make an appearance. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way. Thanks, Beth. Yeah, I'll call you back soon. Okay. Okay, bye. I mean, how cool is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, so what is it, exactly? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She wants me to do the fashion show to promote our stores, to bring a different audience there, since everyone in New York obviously doesn't really know about our stores. My stores will get credit, and they're allowed to use my name for the flyer, and I go in, kind of take a bow, and I leave. Who wouldn't want a free trip to New York? NYC, baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fashion Week is literally my favorite time in New York. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it's so amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I already miss Reggie so much. &gt;&gt; When was the last time you saw him? &gt;&gt; KIM: I went there a week ago. &gt;&gt; Oh, so that's not too... &gt;&gt; KIM: But then after this I won't see him till the end of October. I won't even see him on my birthday. We're gonna have a lot of time apart, but it's gonna be okay. We can totally do it. Lots of iChat. &gt;&gt; iSex. &gt;&gt; You told me you guys... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, we don't. &gt;&gt; Kim takes vibrators to herself while they're on iChat. &gt;&gt; Wait, she takes what? &gt;&gt; Vibrators. Look at her smile! You told me. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I don't. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Just a little more. Beautiful, beautiful. Beautiful. Good show. Great. &gt;&gt; PILAR: Carol Baum just called, um, wanting to book you for the week of, uh, the weekend right around the sixth, the weekend you're gonna be away with Reggie. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm supposed to be there. &gt;&gt; PILAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know I should go to his game, and I want to go to his game. Um... work comes first, so it doesn't matter, just book it, and I'll talk to Reggie. &gt;&gt; PILAR: Okay. I just wanted to make sure you're okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel really bad, but there's no way I can go-- I'm so busy-- and I just hope he understands. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: You look really nice. And, oh, take a step back. Right in there. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Wow, that looks great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: These are cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Beth just called me, and she was, like, "Hey, what are you doing next week? Do you want to go to New York and host this fashion show? We're gonna make it, like, to promote Smooch and Dash and..." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want me to go with you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe has never done anything like this alone. So you're gonna go to New York by yourself? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. It's okay. I can manage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I could go. I could help you out if you need me to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What the hell is wrong with Kris? I mean, I can't even go to New York by myself for a week without her just being so neurotic and crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just get anxious, Khloe, when you tell me these things... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're way too controlling. You really need to focus on your other kids. New York is fine. I could go alone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, babe-o. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, babe. I'm leaving you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, babe, I miss you. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: I miss you, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: You look so cute on... So how hard has the training been? &gt;&gt; REGGIE: It's been pretty tough. I'm really, like, I'm sore at all times. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Can't miss our first game... &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't wait for your first game, too. I'm gonna be watching on TV. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: You can't come? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, my schedule is so hectic. I don't know. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: It's gonna be a pretty big game. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I don't think I can get out of everything that I have going on right now. Don't make me feel even worse. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: I'm not trying to make you feel worse, babe, but you know, it's really, really not cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so exciting. It's so glamorous. &gt;&gt; AUBREY: Are you gonna move here, then? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. I'm debating. &gt;&gt; AUBREY: I think you'd be good here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khlo. What's going on? Wow, how much stuff are you taking? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a little messy in here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, these are cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I'm packing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Have you got all your outfits together? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm doing it now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All I feel is this hot breath down my neck like, "Oh! Get your breath off of me." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love this color. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are not helping right now! I'm stressed out. I'm doing something by myself, and now you're, like, invading my space and touching all my Stop touching my! Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you should... Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Back off, bitch. You need to get a life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Breathe! Let me help. That's what I'm here for. Kourtney, are you gonna call those people and see if they can get me some mediums? Hello? Somebody pay attention to me. I'm the mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I'm doing something. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, if these Spanks don't fit me, you can have them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, thank God, I got a pair of Spanks. So, Kim, are you going to Reggie's game this weekend? &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't go. I have that appearance. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm looking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's his first game. You can't not go to Reggie's first game. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She has an appearance. What do you want her to do? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have a contract. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She has a contract. She can't break it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I can't get out of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim is definitely a workaholic, but at the same time she doesn't leave a lot of room for her personal life. Kim, you just say to him, "Hi, I know it's your first football game of the season, and I'm not going. I have something to do." &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I mean, I have a contract. I can't get out of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What if he loses? &gt;&gt; KIM: So my mom explains to me how important the season opener game is and how supportive I need to be for Reggie. So I'm gonna try to go to the game, but it's killing me to have to break out of this appearance. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've gotta be there. That's important to him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom's willing to give up her ten percent to go? &gt;&gt; KIM: If she's telling me to go, I have to go. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This place looks nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hear it's divine design. Jonathan Cheban is a really good friend of mine, and he owns a clothing line called "Critic." And he's also a publicist. He does events for amazing people like Jennifer Lopez, P. Diddy, Pink. Jonathan knows everything about New York. He's like my personal tour guide. What is the vibrating on the table? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's over the subway. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't like the subway. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I mean, no one <i>likes</i> the subway. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if you get stuck underground? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's the best part about the subway. Like, it has a lot of great parts besides the blackout, the no air conditioning, and the delay of trains. The best part is when you're waiting for the train, you get to see rats running around. It's like a zoo down there. Like, this is a rat tail down in the subway, and I'm not kidding. And you'll see, like, this going through the thing. It's a gorgeous city. I think it'd be great if you came to New York. How fun would that be? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, when have I ever been away from my sisters? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, but sometimes it's time to leave the nest, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It kind of is. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're not a spring chicken. Get it together, Khloe. Let's see if we can find a cab. If worse comes to worse, we'll have to take a bus. You gotta whistle like a... Come on. You gotta raise your hand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't whistle. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: There we go. Can I beg you for a favor? Air conditioning? Thank you. Aren't you hot? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Always. Why do you think I'mmy face? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm melting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:It's the heat. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: And by air conditioning I meant cold. Look, this one. Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dude, you're freaking me out. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: He's unbelievable, this guy. He's like a samurai warrior. Are you a ninja? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love New York: the energy, the people, the vibe, it's so different. I love it here. Look at this person's boots. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God, she makes Kim look like Tiny Tim. Tiny Tim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: My manager Pilar was able to get me out of my appearance, so we're here in New Orleans for the game. And Reggie's so excited. Okay, guys, I bought a whole bunch of stuff. Let's get started. It's the night before the game and the players have to stay in the same hotel. So we're at his house making the signs for Reggie. Should I say "The Bush is gonna whup your tush"? Ready for the Bush. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Will this work for the game? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're all making signs, getting ready for the game, and I just have in the back of my mind I really hope I didn't burn any bridges. Ready? I really hope I didn't make a bad business decision by coming here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. Khloe. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I'll be directing you out, so after the segment, you'll come out after the girls walk through their finale; then I'll send you out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I'll do my little shinzis. It's so cool to sit backstage and just kind of watch it all happening. It's so exciting. It's so glamorous. Models, reporters, designers, makeup, hair. I'm really inspired. I actually love it here. It's so different than L.A. &gt;&gt; AUBREY: Are you gonna move here, then? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. I'm debating. I'm debating. &gt;&gt; AUBREY: I think you'd be good here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. I mean, I'm 24 years old. What am I gonna do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Watching all of this and seeing all of it around me and how every little aspect of it works, it just makes me really excited. It's like I want to learn how to do that. I want to learn how to be involved in all this more. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; FANS: Reggie! Reggie! &gt;&gt; KIM: It's the season opener for the Saints, and just the whole energy in the Superdome is magical. Half the people in there have on Bush jerseys with his number on it. You kinda walk by, you're, like, "Wow, that's <i>my</i> boyfriend that everyone's cheering for. Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Reggie scored the winning touchdown. &gt;&gt; ALL: Reggie! Reggie! Reggie! &gt;&gt; KIM: This was so amazing. I'm so glad I came to support Reggie, and I just can't wait to to see him after the game. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoo! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Does Reggie get extra, like, special bonus sex after he wins a game? &gt;&gt; KIM: He does. The peak of my day was that you guys won, and Reggie got the winning touchdown. &gt;&gt; MAN: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was really exciting for me to witness. I'm so proud of you. Spending time in New Orleans has made me realize that I've been putting my career as my #1 priority, and it's Reggie that needs to be my #1 priority. He makes me happy. And in order for all of this to keep on going the way it's going, I need to kinda switch gears a little bit and balance everything out. Let's toast to the Saints. That they have the most amazing season, injury-free... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: God willing. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and take them to the Superbowl. Whoo! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We need a sweet sake. Are you allowed to drink yet or what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah, I can drink and walk. I just can't drink and drive. I'm different. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Okay. You are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here's a toast. To New York. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: And the possibility of you actually staying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll get into that after this shot. You ready, drunkey monkey? This whole experience in New York has really opened my eyes to so many different things. I feel like I found a new home. After my fashion show and after all this stuff, I just realize there are so many more opportunities in the fashion world in New York for me. I'm really thinking of starting my own line. So I really, like, I think I want to move here and just, like, look into it and... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You need to move, so... And especially New York. It's, like, the fashion capital of the world. There's no way you're gonna be able to do what you want in California. It just... it will never work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The fact that I have to tell my mom. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: When I left L.A., my mom was, like, in tears crying. She was at the airport crying, like, the week before, but get serious, Khloe, 'cause there's no more time for games. You really either have to do it or you're gonna have to go back and run the clothing store. You don't want your dream of the clothing line? Or you're gonna go back and be a practical salesgirl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but seriously, like, I'm a little scared to tell my mom. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's gonna be a shock to her. It's a really big deal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so scared to tell her. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She's gonna have a heart attack, and she's gonna just freak out. What are you gonna do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. I'm going to move to New York. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not going to New York. Do I make you miserable that you have to move off to another city? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm... &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Mm! &gt;&gt; KIM: When Reggie and I are together, I get this feeling all over of just calmness, nothing else in the world matters, just him and I. Babe, it's gonna be so long until I see you next. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have to make it work. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Of course. My schedule's set for the next... next five months. &gt;&gt; KIM: My schedule's set for the next two months, so the second this is over... &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Good. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...I'll be at ever single game. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: And we're just gonna have to iChat. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: You can just move out here. You can just move to New Orleans. &gt;&gt; KIM: In two months, I'll move here. How's that? &gt;&gt; REGGIE: That's what I'm saying. Afterward, you can just move out here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll come to every single game. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay? I promise. I'm tired. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: You want to go to sleep? Shorty. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shorty. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Short stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: Short stuff? You're hot stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have an announcement to make. &gt;&gt; KIM: I got these, like, antique Tiffany's diamonds. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, everyone, <i>atención.</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'm engaged. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim doesn't give <i>atención</i> very well. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Hello? I'm serious. Okay, guys, I'm going to move to New York. Whoo-hoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't think you'd like it, but I love it there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The four "B"s: Barney's, Bergdorf's, Bendel's and Bloomie's. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you told Mom? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so happy for Khloe. This is gonna be such an amazing life experience for her. I just really hope my mom doesn't freak out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Telling my sisters was the easy part. Telling my mom, I'm a little nervous about. I really have something important to tell you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you pregnant? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, say it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm just fat. I'm not pregnant. Anyway, I really think, no, I know that I'm going to move to New York. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't understand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's just so many other opportunities like, to start my clothing line and doing all that and then... &gt;&gt; KIM: Of course. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Buying an apartment for Kourtney to always stay with me at. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is amazing! This will help her stores, &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, it's like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can come and help me decorate; you can have a place to stay if you want to go to New York. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: I-I love it there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're really gonna move to New York? You're not going to New York. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? You're ruining my moment. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you so unhappy here? Do I make you miserable? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why do I have to be unhappy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to move off to another city? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why does this have to be about you? Snap out of it! Ugh! You act like I'm going to Germany for 37 months. I'm going to New York. First of all, that doesn't mean I'm there and I'm never coming back. &gt;&gt; KIM: And we go to New York all the time, Mom. New York is our favorite place. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim's going Monday. Calm down! If I love it and fall in love, I might stay for the rest of my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, it's not funny. You guys are just a little selfish sometimes. You don't think about the rest of your family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're selfish?! You're the one that's... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And how it's going to affect us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're telling me not to grow and conquer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I want you to grow and conquer. I just want you to do it in L.A.! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here, Krissy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Gotta go, guys! Think about what you're talking to me about before you start giving me this kind of information. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's psychotic. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Apartment hunting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not gonna be that far away from us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why do you want to hold me back? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom begs us to have babies. We should buy Mom like a talking parrot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A monkey is the next best thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is there a monkey in the house? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is gonna be your baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna kill my girls. &gt;&gt;
