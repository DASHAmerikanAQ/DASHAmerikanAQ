- &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Previously on Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I went to New York for Fashion Week to host a fashion show for my stores Dash and Smooch. The fashion show went so much better than expected, so I have a crazy revelation. I really thinking of starting my own line. And so I really, like, I think I want to move here and just, like, look into it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You either want your dream of the clothing line, or you're going to go back and be a practical salesgirl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Be an employee, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not going to New York. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you going to tell... Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do we-- I make you miserable that you think you have to move off to another city? &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't you want your daughter to grow? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why does this have to be about you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't think about the rest of your family and how it's going to affect us. I want you to grow and conquer, I just want you to do it in L.A. And why are you going to New York? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because I'm going to go apartment hunting. And if I find an apartment that I like, it depends, I don't know. I don't know what it is like to live there, but I have to feel it out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've lived in New York. I lived there for almost a year, and it's no fun to be that far away from your family. &gt;&gt; KIM: When? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When? With who? &gt;&gt; KRIS: In 1976, by myself. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, times have changed. You can hop on a plane and go back and forth whenever you want. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was an airline stewardess. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm supposed to go to New York twice in the next week, like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: But, Kourtney, but she wants to go live there. You're not going to be that far away from us. I just won't allow it. I don't really feel like I had time to get used to the idea of Khloe moving to New York. This has made me so upset and anxious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, it's like why do you want to hold me back? I'm really trying to grow. I'm trying to do something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want to hold anybody back, but what am I going to do here by myself? You're going to be gone. She's always gone. Now, she's going to be gone, 'cause she's going to be visiting you. I'm hurt, I'm shocked and I still can't wrap my head around the fact that she's leaving. Khloe, I want you to follow your dreams and I want you to be happy, but it just makes me sad because you guys are my best friends. You know, it's what I do all day long. And if you guys aren't here, then I won't have anything like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Waa, waa, waa... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, call the waambulance." &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks. Can you believe I took this dress home for Kylie and I realized that she's bigger than she used to be? It's like I'm living in the past or something. I'm so over these kids getting so big, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kids these days are just large. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't have anybody to take care of the way I used to take care of you guys. I think that's why I had so many kids. I'm not complete. I wish I could have another baby. And Bruce has had a vasectomy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're complete. You have six kids, and you can't just keep having babies forever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You could have a baby. There's an idea. Hi, somebody could help me out here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom... So you want us to get knocked up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I don't want you to get knocked up. I just want you to get the show on the road. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, go bug Kim and Khloe about your baby syndrome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You could just be a little more sensitive. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My womb aches. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Eww! That's sick. ♫ ♫ Scott is really on my last nerve. He's just, like, being a douche. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why, what did he do? Tell me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I think he always needs attention. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Duh! You're not someone that's, like, "Aww... it will be okay." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't worry. 'Cause you do it. What? Come on, I know I'm sexual, but stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, let me just tell you something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here, sit on my lap. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Huh-uh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-mnh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to have incest with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My little baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, guys, stop making out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to burp? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, Sam came over and her baby was so cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, Mom told me... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom asked me to have a baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom asked me to have a baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She asked me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She never asked you, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bible, she asked me today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are the least maternal person ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She asked me. &gt;&gt; KIM: She is, like, going through a midlife crisis and just wants a kid around. Oh, my God. We should buy Mom, like, a talking parrot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that going to do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A companion? &gt;&gt; KIM: She just has this, like, empty nest syndrome. Yes, she needs a companion. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Someone to talk to so she doesn't call us all day. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's lonely. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They say one word. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, okay-- let's get her, like, those babies that they rent in high school when they're trying to teach you a lesson. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She will throw it away. Do you think Mom will keep that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, she will literally throw it in the store. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look, people are really into getting monkeys and animals and raising them as a kid. "Empty nesters looking to relive all the fun of raising children without relying on turbulent teens are adopting some of our closest relatives: monkeys." Look at this Web site. You can totally rent a chimpanzee. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sure that's, like, not legal. They're going to drop a monkey off? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They do it all the time. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, they come with a trainer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't believe you can go online and just rent a monkey, and it shows up at your door the next day. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I would dress him up and he would drink from a bottle. He basically never left my side. He needed constant attention. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, this is exactly what my mom is going through. She needs something that she could get the feeling that she still has kids there and life there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, let's do it. I would love it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get the number. Kourtney, I won't have to bother you anymore, I'll just play with the monkey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank God, get one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you going to get jealous? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll hug you until I get one, okay? Yeah, that's true. I mean... Suzy! : Suzy. &gt;&gt; STEVE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; STEVE: This is Suzy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Suzy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: So Steve the trainer comes over to teach us how to take care of Suzy. He shows us how to feed her, how to change her little diaper... The kinds of clothes she likes to put on, and just everything that we'd need to know about taking care of a chimpanzee. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aww... &gt;&gt; STEVE: They love juice bags. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know my mom loves kids. Her youngest kid is 11 years old. There's no diapers. There's no strollers and all that nonsense. So I think she forgets how much work a baby really is. Mom is going to die. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She is going to freak out. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom! Come here, we have a present for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A prezzy? I love prezzies. Oh, my God. What? What? Who is that? What is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's your new baby, Suzy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Suzy has a diaper on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Suzy, look at Kris. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's your mommy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is there a monkey in the house, honestly? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is going to be your baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Meet Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Suzy. Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You've been talking about wanting a baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aww... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She likes you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you guys changed her diaper? Whoo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not yet. We're leaving that all for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You get a monkey and you bring it over here? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you have empty nest syndrome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, I kind of thought maybe somebody would have a baby, get pregnant, give birth... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At least she can't talk back to you. She could just steal your cell phone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know I'm going through something, but a monkey is not the answer. She's adorable. But I've got to get back to work, so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's going to be all yours for one week. You'll have to get used to it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, but she... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, Mom, Khloe's going to New York tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm not here. &gt;&gt; KIM: The trainer's gone. We got this for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys, I can't be taking care of an animal. Suzy's got to go home now, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The monkey is paid for, so the monkey is staying. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, look. Look, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Suzy... &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, that's so cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, get down from Mama's bed. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye, Mom. Have fun with Suzy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait a minute. You're not leaving. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Got to go, bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See you later, bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys, not funny. This isn't funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait for me! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What am I supposed to do with a monkey? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: So how long are you staying this time for? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like three or five days. I have a couple meetings and stuff. I'm here, work trip. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Well, we better get some dinners in. And I definitely want to, like, take you out a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guess what? I set up a meeting with, like, a realtor and everything to look at places around here. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I swear. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's a good-- that's really... I'm, like, I-I'm speechless, because that means there's a chance you're moving here and I'll get to see you all... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, we'll see. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I hate when you get me all wound up and excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I finally told Kris that I was thinking of coming here, just like looking. And she threw, like, a bitch-fit and thought I was joking. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I don't think she really thinks you'll actually move. So if you do, which I highly doubt myself 'cause I know you. You're like up and down like a yo-yo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. It's amazing. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You'll be moving back to L.A. before you even move here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Jonathan asks me if I'm serious about me moving to New York. And I expect these questions from my friends. They know how I am. They know that I always come up with these fabulous ideas, then I just never proceed with them. So I'm not offended, but it just gives me more ammunition. Like, I really, really want to prove to everyone that I can do this. That I can move here. I can start my line. You know what I was thinking? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If, like, I move here and I do my line and everything goes well, wouldn't it be amazing if you were my P.R. person for my line? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I mean, yeah, it would be amazing, but... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But what?! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I don't think you're going to be able to afford me. All right, I love you. Do you need any help? Should I get someone or no? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm fine. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All right. I'll call you later. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you, peaches. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, champagne. The first thing I want to try to accomplish in New York is find an apartment. I feel like if I come home and tell my family that I found an apartment, they will really take me seriously. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: You like that? It's kind of big though. Let's try it on. Okay. I love being a mom. Been doing this for 30 years now, raising babies. So can you blame me just for wanting one little baby around? Look, this is so cute. You're going to love this. I know. This is going to be so cute. Bingo! Okay. Ooh, look. Look at the balloon. Balloon... oh! Suzy! Suzy! Eat your breakfast. Ooh, yeah. Suzy is like an infant and I really forgot how hard it is to have a baby. Whoo! Okay, Suzy... Suzy. Come on, Suzy. Okay, come on. I'm going to kill my girls, because Suzy just does not stop. You made such a big mess, Suzy. Suzy, oh, no-no-no-no, honey. Honey. Oh, Suzy. Never going to get any sleep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This apartment, it's sad. Wait, where's the bedroom? If this is all I could afford, then I won't be coming here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Hi, Khloe, I'm Carla with City Habitat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; CARLA: This is my assistant, Tim. &gt;&gt; TIM: Hi, Tim. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice to meet you. This is Melissa. &gt;&gt; MELISSA: Hi. Melissa. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Nice to meet you. Welcome. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My friend, Melissa, is going to come with me apartment hunting. She's from New York and she's lived there forever. So she's going to be someone great to show me, like, what areas are great and if I'm getting a good deal or not. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Come on in. Take a look around. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice. &gt;&gt; MELISSA: The elevator drops you off right in there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, I love it. &gt;&gt; CARLA: This was the model, and the decorator, Perisi, decorated everything. And he's in the process of just finishing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This apartment, it's totally my style. It's on the penthouse, it's two stories, it's to die for. &gt;&gt; CARLA: You have... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my. &gt;&gt; CARLA: ...an iron door and the elevator as well. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But someone could still, like, look in and while I'm sleeping. &gt;&gt; CARLA: No, absolutely not, because they'd have to have a key to do that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, cool. There's no way this place is $2,500 a month. We have a little misunderstanding here. &gt;&gt; MELISSA: How much is it? &gt;&gt; CARLA: It's $25,000. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, wait. &gt;&gt; MELISSA: $25,000. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Which is really a great deal. &gt;&gt; MELISSA: That's your price range? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; MELISSA: That's a lot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think... When I sent you an e-mail, I meant $2,500 a month. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The bitch thought I meant $25,000 a month. For an apartment. Would I find anything, like, like this in my price range? Maybe not in this... &gt;&gt; CARLA: Well, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; CARLA: You know, I can make a few calls. &gt;&gt; MELISSA: All right, so that didn't work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, not at all. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Suzy. We're here at the park, Suzy. All right, we got jungle gyms... Sounds like a good afternoon. Who's stuck with the monkey now? Me. I'm the monkey keeper. This is what my life has come to. Come on, buddy, let's see what you can do. That's cheating. Come on. Grab ahold of this. Right there, right there. Right there, come on. Get this one. Get this one. Come on. Get this one. Actually, it's kind of a cute, little monkey if you're into monkeys. I'm really not into monkeys, but... Here we go. Come here. Over like this. Like this, like that, like that, like that... All right, let's sit over here. Come on. This is just like I did with all the little kids. This little monkey at the park is just a ball. I have a relationship with a monkey. This is kind of scary. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; TIM: So we found this place. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not as nice on the outside. &gt;&gt; TIM: Um, it's... it's, um, more "neighborhooded." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It has potential. &gt;&gt; TIM: It has potential. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is it? &gt;&gt; TIM: So it's actually below street level. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Is this...? &gt;&gt; TIM: It's private, definitely private. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Private entry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's vintage. &gt;&gt; TIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sexy. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Hardwood floors. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why does it smell like this? &gt;&gt; CARLA: Um, I think they just cleaned it up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, this is a clean smell? &gt;&gt; CARLA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh... What is this for? &gt;&gt; TIM: Just, um, protection. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Just a little security. &gt;&gt; TIM: Yeah, 'cause it's on the street, you know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cute... &gt;&gt; TIM: Um, and there's no stove. But you could get, like, a hot plate or something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A what? &gt;&gt; TIM: A hot plate. &gt;&gt; CARLA: You know, it's a two burner... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This apartment, it's sad. Wait, where's the bedroom? &gt;&gt; CARLA: Well, this is... &gt;&gt; TIM: It's a studio. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's, like, underneath stairs and there's, like, a homeless man sleeping in the doorway. And I feel like I'm in, like, a train station. There's, like, piping all on the... It's just like not normal that someone lives there. There's not even a bedroom. &gt;&gt; TIM: You could get a Murphy bed. It pulls down. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Or you could do a futon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This isn't like Sex and the City. Where's her place? She doesn't have a lot of money. She only writes a column. &gt;&gt; CARLA: It's rent-controlled so... &gt;&gt; TIM: Sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If this is where I have to live in New York... Kitchen table. If this is all I could afford... This is, like, more than odd. ...then I won't be coming here. Where's my airplane ticket? I need out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't see why she has the need to move to New York. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. I think a lot of this problem is you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Suzy, Suzy. Suzy, give it to me. Thank you very much. Clean your mouth off, then your feet. That's good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, babe. What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Suzy. Do you like Papa Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, this is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kind of looks like Kourtney when Kourtney was little. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here. No, Suzy. Suzy loves to play, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have you heard from Khloe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. She should be checking in with me and telling me what's going on. I don't see why she has the need to move to New York. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. Kimberly, what, she was 18 when she got her first apartment. By 19, she had snuck off to Vegs and got married. The kids are growing up. You got to realize that every mother goes through this. I mean, the kids leave the house at some point. I think a lot of this problem is you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes I think I just need to admit and recognize that the kids need their space, and they have their own lives. I mean, I could be too clingy. I admit that maybe sometimes I'm the problem, because I want to be so controlling all the time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is amazing. You're admitting you're the problem? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kind of. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is... this is growing up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't spread that around. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Suzy, come here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, honey, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I gotta go. Bye. See you later. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really don't think this was a good idea anymore. I really should have researched it more online before I told everyone I wanted to come here. Hi. &gt;&gt; How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. How are you? I'm here to see Daymond. Daymond John is this amazing entrepreneur. He owns FUBO and Coogi, Heatherette and a bunch of other lines. I'm asking him questions to make sure that I'm making the right step in coming out here. And if this is even the right time for me to start my own line. &gt;&gt; DAYMOND: You know, the main question is-- you've been in the fashion thing for a couple years with the store. You know, you're actually more important to designers than the designers are sometimes... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; DAYMOND: ...because you're touch the consumer. You know what's going on out there. So the question is going to be: When is it time for Khloe to start her line? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. That's what I want my next step to be. But that's also why I like... &gt;&gt; DAYMOND: It's time now though, it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is. &gt;&gt; DAYMOND: You know, because people are starting to recognize you and recognize Dash and recognize the sense of style that you and your family have in general. And I think that if there was any time, I think that it would really be now. True. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. My meeting with Daymond really builds me up, and it makes me really confident, because he's so encouraging and he sees that I could do this. And so it really makes me feel like this is something I could really accomplish. &gt;&gt; DAYMOND: Good? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not so nervous. &gt;&gt; DAYMOND: All right, good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay. &gt;&gt; DAYMOND: So, have a great one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; DAYMOND: I'll see you later. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kourt's here. Look out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is Steve. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is Steve. He's Suzy's trainer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Steve. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Suzy's day is over. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you cured? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I don't want to see Suzy go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, you're the one who said Suzy needs to get picked up early. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. See you later. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Suzy and I are out of here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye Suzy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I actually think having Suzy around the house was a really great experience for me. And I'm really glad I went through it, 'cause it's way too much work. So, kids, you can all settle down now. Mama's healed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank God, a good night's sleep. Yes! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is nicer. The realtor called me. I'm going to look at these apartments with fresh eyes. I'm determined to make this work. &gt;&gt; CARLA: So I think this will be a great example of a two bedroom in your price range. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's up? &gt;&gt; So you have all of the, like, Lower East Side. And there's a park. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I love the park view. Another bedroom. Love. I like this one, too. &gt;&gt; Oh, good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How much is this one? &gt;&gt; CARLA: This one is $5,550. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that's perfect. &gt;&gt; CARLA: So I think it's the right price. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Perfect. I think I like this one. This apartment is perfect. But I think I need to take a couple minutes, think about it. I feel like home. Thank you. Am I really ready for such a big commitment? It's really scary. ♫ ♫ I love it. This is to die. This is our last one. &gt;&gt; I like this color. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lily and I are just going over inventory and stuff. &gt;&gt; KRISTA: You are? Do you like my new coat? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you look nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was New York? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, New York was amazing. I had fun. But then I feel like I don't want to come back here and, like, share that with you, 'cause I'm like, why rub it in her face how much fun I had and how great it was, and...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, I want you to have a good time. I want you to have fun and enjoy your life. And you can't worry about me and my feelings. You have to go out and live your life and have a good time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You won't get mad? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I can't promise that I won't get mad, but I'll try. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I actually went apartment hunting in New York. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you find anything? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I actually did. But I didn't sign the lease. I decided I don't want to rush into it. I want to be really smart about this move. I'm still thinking about it. It's still just thoughts. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This isn't easy for me to say, you know, and I don't like admitting when I'm a little bit wrong, but the truth is, you're 24 years old and it's time for you to do what you want to do in life. And I just want you to know that whatever you chose to do, I will always be here to support you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so happy my mom is finally approving. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just glad you're home. I love you, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you, too. I mean, it took her long enough to realize I'm a woman. Jesus. Cooties. Mom cooties. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ew, you just... No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, stop tickling me! Next on Keeping Up With the Kardashians-- &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're going camping. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Adrienne's family's very conservative, very religious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bring some condoms. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: This is not going well. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Would I like to get rid of some wrinkles? Who doesn't want to get rid of some wrinkles? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce has decided to go ahead with the surgery. It's a big deal. Okay, you guys ready? One, two, three!
