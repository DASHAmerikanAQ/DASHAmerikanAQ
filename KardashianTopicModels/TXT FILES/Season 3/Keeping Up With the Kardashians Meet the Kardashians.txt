- &gt;&gt; KIM: Tonight on <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>With the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 1984, I just went through my second divorce, lost millions. I had a little thing done on with nose, had it straightened out, a little dinky lift. If you Google my name, "The worst plastic surgeries of all time," or whatever it is. I just don't know if could take the scrutiny. &gt;&gt; FISHER: Blending it in where nobody notices anything would be my goal with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't realize how upset I would be when we got to the operating room here today because it's, it's a big deal. I know that this is gonna be a really, really long day. I can't wait till it's over and that I just know that my husband's okay. Oh, my God! Are you guys ready? One, two, three! Okay, who at this table has had a vasectomy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce has a scar on his penis? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe is traumatized. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, Khloe, I did have a vasectomy so I'd have no more children like you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You didn't have me. He's so confused. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, but the potential. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You notice how the conversation was going great until all of a sudden, everybody, like, picks up their text and they... That's it. We're going camping. I'm telling you. We're leaving all the electronics behind. When I was growing up, the greatest vacations we had: camping. It was the best! I want to bring that to my family. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Bruce, Adrienne's family's coming into town to see her, and she can't go on the camping trip. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Adrienne, you're going. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: And neither will I. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you have to! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Adrienne, why don't you invite your family to go with us? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honestly, I have enough room. The way to make this camping trip work, everybody has to go. I say just bring Adrienne's parents. The more the merrier. Hello, we have not met. &gt;&gt; NILDA: Hi, Bruce. It's Nilda. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am doing great. I'm here with Kris. And I'm taking the girls on a camping trip, but it just so happens to be the same time you guys are out here. Adrienne doesn't want to go. And Rob doesn't want to go because you guys are gonna be in town, so what I thought: invite you guys to go out with us. Are you an adventurous kind of spirit? &gt;&gt; NILDA: Oh, sure! We're up for it. Why not? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You'd go camping with us? This is wonderful. I like you already. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay, they're in! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're in, guys. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: This is not gonna work, you know? My family, their family, completely different backgrounds. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, we're really looking forward to meeting you. &gt;&gt; NILDA: Wonderful. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I don't even understand how this happened. I'm looking at Rob, like, "Please, save me." How do you meet someone for the first time? Like, "Hi, I'm now gonna spend the next 48 hours with you." Like, it's just awkward. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: This trip isn't exactly the best way for Adrienne's family, my family to meet. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Okay, this is, like, my parent's catching Kourtney and Scott having sex in the tent right next to them! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I definitely am gonna tell my family you cannot be how you normally are around her family. You got to be on your best behavior. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: My parents are a little old school. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Let's just say they live at the end of the cul-de-sac and not on the corner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob is probably nervous. This family could be his possible in-laws. I think he doesn't want to scare them off. We're probably rowdier than Rob would like, but that's us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. That's... Oh, my God. Stop. Come on, guys. Don't hurt him. Khloe, don't hurt him. Khloe, you're sitting on him! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Give me the correct password. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; SHIEH: Today we're gonna be doing the Trinity skin series. It's a three-in-one, non-invasive procedure. It's a complete approach to skin rejuvenation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been thinking about getting a little mini facelift for a couple of years. But before I do that, my doctor's referred me to a skin rejuvenation center for a laser treatment. &gt;&gt; SHIEH: Now we want to use the anesthetic because we want people to be as comfortable as possible during the treatment. It feels like a rubber band snap. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can feel my cheeks. &gt;&gt; SHIEH: Yeah, you can feel it when you touch it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. But is that good or bad? &gt;&gt; SHIEH: Yeah, that's good for right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just slap me and see if I feel it. I think it looks a little bit better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow, Mom, you look glowing! You don't need a facelift. I don't think you should do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How does my neck look from the side? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like a turkey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll tell you who I wish would geta facelift... is Bruce. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like it's to fix what happened, you know, what what they did before. He did that, what, when he was 30? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's always had low self-esteem. When Bruce went to a surgeon many, many years ago to have his nose done, not only did the guy botch the job and had to do it again, but he talked Bruce into some surgery. Bruce trusted him, and he went a little too far with the face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shh-shh-shh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What, a town hall meeting or what is this? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're discussing if Mom should get a mini facelift. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. 1984, just went through my second divorce, lost millions. Was living by myself, wasn't feeling very good. Had, like, the hook taken out of my little nose here. It was, like, referred to as the "Bob Hope ski-jump nose" in the media. And just a little, little lift right here. I've caught hell ever since. The media just came down on me! Oh, my God! It hurts a lot of times, the things they say. If you Google my name, "The worst plastic surgeries of all time" or whatever, it is. I don't know. They've compared me to Michael Jackson. I mean, the media can be brutal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know he really wants to fix his face. He just needs to be pushed a little bit so that he takes care of something that's made him feel really bad for a really long time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If I had a little here and a little there, the media would go bananas. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Do you know where we're going this weekend? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: All I know is we're driving. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: See, I can't deal. You need to get information. I don't know what the hell I'm packing. I need to call your mom and ask her what I'm supposed to pack. I'm so worried about this trip. I'm just thinking of all the ways that this could go so wrong. They're spending a full 48 hours together. Eat, sleep, breathing, all that up in the same air. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah, it's probably not a good idea. My family going camping with Adrienne's family is just bringing a lot of anxiety to me 'cause my sisters are just so inappropriate. They're gonna be trying to, like, mess with me, especially with her family there. They're gonna be very embarrassing. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: We need to tell Khloe no sex talk. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Well, they're all, they're gonna, like, do something to embarrass me, so that's just how it works. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go, girls. Everybody in. Do you have any cell phones? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Nope. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Anything electronic on you? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Pass. Give me your cell phone right now. Come on. Let's go. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Oh, I'm a good girl. I didn't bring it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You didn't bring it? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: See that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's my girl. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Fully focused. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Give me your cell phone. We're moving, guys. I see people on the street. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Yes, that's them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, let's pick 'em up. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: My mom in the yellow shirt. It's very rare that my whole family takes a trip like this. My mom Nilda, my stepdad Joe, my sister Claudette and her fianc√© Jer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited you guys are going with us. &gt;&gt; JOE: We haven't been camping in a while, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I can say is, "buckle your seatbelt." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Adrienne's parents coming on this camping trip, you know, with all these girls... You never know what's going to happen. You know, you just got to kind of hope for the best and I'm sure Robert's hoping for the best. All right, let's pile on the bus. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to drink a toast to Nilda and Joe. &gt;&gt; NILDA: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Happy anniversary! &gt;&gt; ALL: Happy anniversary! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at us. We're just passing cars left and right. I'm telling you. Let's see if they can keep up with the Kardashians. We're going camping! This is it. This is it. Looks like we're here, guys. We're out here in God's country. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's nothing here, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All we need now is to set up camp. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, he wants us to help him? Is he kidding? I'm not doing that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Assemble the poles 1A, 1B and 1C. Do not allow the shot cord to snap the pole sectioning." What the? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Language, Khloe, language. My stepdad is a marine. He has a purple heart. He's very conservative and he feels like, as a parent, we should have respect for him when he is around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Please help me! &gt;&gt; KIM: We need to put the sticks together first. &gt;&gt; KRIS: &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is not fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not a very... &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I don't know how to be with my family and then watch whatever Adrienne's family... I don't know how to make the two work, so it's going to be a really difficult situation. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: This is the good life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, guys. It's 5:00. Does anybody want a drink? I have Le Torment. &gt;&gt; KIM: I got a Corona. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nobody has a corkscrew. Where's Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's gone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, there's a group of people down here on the shore. Come help me get a wine opener. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I'm not even drinking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I'm going now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bring some condoms. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Khloe's making comments about sex, condoms. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hope you enjoy it. Bring some lube. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: This is not going well. I'm in a difficult situation right now. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Is Papa upset about something? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Adrienne, would you ratherRobert's for a minute or would you ratherhis for a minute? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe! &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Is Papa upset about something? Papa! &gt;&gt; JOE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: They're not always like this, I promise it to you. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: They'll be cool, okay? Just relax. Have a Corona, Papa. &gt;&gt; JOE: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The Bertlands are the best. Isn't that good? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't it great? Khloe, do you love it? Who would eat something like this? This is gross. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you have a good day? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I hope the kids had a good day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, do you care if I go ahead and make that appointment with Garth? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: With Garth? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dr. Garth Fisher is one of the most amazing plastic surgeons I know. Not only is he a good friend, but he's a genius. The only reason I bring up this consultation is because I know that it's something that Bruce really wants to do. He wants to correct the mistake that was made many, many years ago. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's just... We're camping now. Let's just enjoy the camping. We'll discuss it later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you guys want to tell scary stories? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, let's just play the game "Would you rather..." Okay, Khloe's going to start. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, would you rather have a threesome with Bruce or would you rather just watch Bruce have sex with someone else? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Stop, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now, you have to answer one. Which one would you rather do? But if you don't answer it, then you have to take a shot of Patr√≥n. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll take a shot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, let's ask Rob a question. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Would you rather us tell the story about how you got the name "Pee Boy" or how Kim and I flicked your? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Adrienne, would you ratherRobert's for a minute or would you ratherhis for a minute? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe! &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Everyone else is laughing and I know my dad is just furious. He's just, like, "That's not funny." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kourtney, would you rather... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's Rob? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I really need Rob's help in this situation. I'm hoping that he can talk to his family and tell them to please just chill out a little bit on the crazy sexual remarks. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: There's nothing I can do, you know? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: If it was the other way around and my family was doing something that made your family uncomfortable, I would be like, "Yo, check it out. You can't do that." I would never make your family feel uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Adrienne's dad, you know, looks very upset. Adrienne's concerned. I don't really know how to approach the situation. I've never been in a situation like this. I don't know what to... I can't... I don't know what to say. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but it's humiliating. We cannot talk like that in front of Adrienne's family. Rob is the baby in our family. I don't think he has a voice that's heard and respected. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You know, their parents are so strict, I can't even... I don't even sleep in the same room as Adrienne, like, we're sleeping in the same tent. It's like... That's even cutting it... &gt;&gt; KIM: You have to say something to them. I think that Rob has to just grow up and be a man and take a stand for himself and if he wants everyone to shut up, he just needs to tell everybody what to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is your problem? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Adrienne's family doesn't... They're not, like, feeling me right now. They're probably hating me because... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? What? I will beat them. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I come from a family who talks about balls and sex and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know why if I sex and, oh it's so funny and balls. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I don't know why say... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, stop it! I think the girls have always looked at Rob as the baby of the family and no matter how old he gets, they don't really listen to him when he needs them to. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Guys! Listen! Listen, seriously. You guys cannot be doing this. You guys don't respect my decision at all. As a member of this family, I just asked you guys to just do one thing for me and that was to behave. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob is totally right. We don't really give him a lot of respect. He's, like, our little brother. You're right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Trust me, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you did this to me, I would totally cut your balls off, so I totally get it. I love you and I respect you and I'm sorry that you even feel, like, that we don't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're sorry, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: But seriously, this means the most to me. It's Adrienne-- I love her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so shocked, Rob is actually standing up for himself. I'm actually impressed. I really don't want you to be mad at us, 'cause we love you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ah, thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. You're a good boy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, you're touching my boob in a weird way. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I hope today just works out so much better than it did yesterday. &gt;&gt; ROB: It will. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Lord, make it a good day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going to go check on Adrienne's parents and see if everyone wants some breakfast. Good morning. I'm going to go get some breakfast. Do you want any? The camping trip is almost over. I think we really want Adrienne's family to know that we do care about their feelings, and so we kind of make that extra effort. I come bearing coffee. &gt;&gt; NILDA: Ooh, perfect. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Joe. You know, I kind of look at the kids-- kind of the big picture of the kids. I mean, they're really, really good kids. Especially Robert. You'd be lucky to get Robert in your family. &gt;&gt; JOE: Oh, yeah, we love Robert. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll try to talk to the kids about keeping the language down, you know. &gt;&gt; JOE: Actually. you know, it's a lot more me than anything else. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know. Well, I'm the same way. Sometimes you want to strangle them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What was the highlight of the camping trip for you, Kourtney? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's gonna moon us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's ten years old. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get cellulite removal, you fat ass. &gt;&gt; ROB: It was good to see that feel more comfortable with my family now, and, like, over time they'll become closer. But that made me happy to see that, you know, they actually were able to, like, laugh with each other. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, guys, let's pack it up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, one, two... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Great trip, everybody. &gt;&gt; ROB: This trip was awesome. My family, Adrienne's family got along. I got to knock some sense into my family more often. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's 5:00-- time for a cocktail. We're out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's good to see Garth. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; GARTH: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Always good to see you, sir. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited that Bruce finally agreed to the consultation with Dr. Garth Fisher. &gt;&gt; GARTH: When did you have your work done? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: '84. &gt;&gt; GARTH: Same hairstyle. Most people don't have the same hairstyle over 30 years like you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Jealous? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Most people don't have the same hair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Jealous? &gt;&gt; GARTH: Here's what I see. You know, the part of your face that was pulled? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; GARTH: You know, that's stayed pulled, but the rest of it's kind of falling around it. And I think this looks older than it looks, because this looks a little bit younger. So here's what I would do. Starting with the neck, I would want to bring your neck up, take this extra skin out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; GARTH: Not pull this back. This does not need to be pulled back. 'cause I think it was pulled back too much. This probably needs to come up just a little bit on the side, and that's it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just feel like this. I took took so much flak back in the '80s over this. I mean-- and they still today. You know, I'm on "Worst Plastic Surgeries Ever." &gt;&gt; GARTH: This is ultimately your call. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nobody can really tell Bruce what to do. Our only option is to kind of say our piece, wait for it to cook a little bit and see what his decision is. &gt;&gt; GARTH: I think the goal of surgery is to make you look very natural, and obviously, putting everything back and blending it in where nobody notices anything, would be my goal with you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Long day. Well, I've decided. I mean, after our meeting with Garth-- I mean, he's a good guy, great surgeon, this and that. How doesn't want to get rid of a few wrinkles? I'll get rid of a few wrinkles, you know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, it's a lot more than a few wrinkles. I think you need to do this, if you're going to do this, because you want to do this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you know, I'm thinking hey, why not? I think I'll go through with it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce has decided to go ahead with the surgery. And that makes me really happy. We just want him to be happy and to feel good about himself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why not? Get rid of a few wrinkles. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But it's so cute the way that he's finding other excuses, like just the little wrinkles, or this or that. He's not really admitting that he's going to correct this bad surgery. Which is kind of cute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But think of this, honey... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...this scenario. Everybody coming up to you and saying, "God, you're married to a much younger man. How do you deal with it, babe?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can deal with it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can you, ma'am? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; GARTH: That's good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Will it look normal right away, or does it take a few weeks? &gt;&gt; GARTH: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: For Halloween, I'm going to be Frankenstein. &gt;&gt; GARTH: It's going to take about two weeks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He refuses to take his ring off for the surgery. &gt;&gt; GARTH: That's really sweet. Isn't that nice? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't realize how upset I would be when we got to the operating room here today, because it's a big deal. Good luck, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know Garth Fisher is the best plastic surgeon ever. It's just scary. It's like you're altering your face. Want us to sing to you? ‚ô´ Bye low, bye low, bye low. ‚ô´ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know that this is going to be a really, really long day. I can't wait till it's over and that I just know that my husband's okay. Bruce is being put out. We don't know how long the surgery's gonna take. Dr. Fisher thinks about eight or nine hours. It's like, eight or nine hours? Hey. &gt;&gt; NURSE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's he doing? &gt;&gt; NURSE: He's doing great. We just finished. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; NURSE: The surgery went exceedingly well. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, good. &gt;&gt; NURSE: And he's going to be in recovery for a while. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; NURSE: Wanted to let you know that it's finished. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you so much. Come on. And no peeking, you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're not peeking. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No peeking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you guy ready? One, two, three! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, it's been a little while since "the surgery," to correct all the problems, you know, from the old surgery from a long time ago, but I have to say, Garth Fisher is a genius. Why? Nobody really knew I had anything done. They just kept saying, "Bruce, hey, you look great." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I adore my husband. It's such a brave thing for him to get this surgery. And I'm just really happy, honey, that you did it. Meet my younger husband. I'm a cougar now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes. Yeah, and it does hurt to be mistaken for Brody once in a while. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hug the new you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hug the new me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to hug the young Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you think-- you think I'll get carded? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah? You think so? &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Next on <i>Keeping</i> <i>Up With the Kardashians--</i> &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've got eyeliner on, you've got lipstick on. Go wash your face. All this makeup-- the hair, the outfits... Kylie's only 11 years old. No, I'm done. Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, you're going to make a scene. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't get people that are so selfish like you. It's disgusting to be related to you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I pissed you off? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Seriously, I'm going to have to leave.
