- &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Previously on <i>Keeping Up with the</i> <i>Kardashians...</i> &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I went to New York for Fashion Week to host a fashion show, and I have a crazy revelation. I'm really thinking of starting my own line. I think I want to move here and just, like, look into it. Kourtney, if you want me to cuddle with you, get the fur off your bed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll keep this to myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good, take it. I can't have the fur near me. Have you heard from Scott yet? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's midnight here, so what time is it there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 3:00. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And he hasn't called you back to say good night or anything? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shady. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should I call him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, it's your boyfriend. Duh, call him. Scott has been in New York now for almost over a day, and I haven't heard from him. I just hate when he goes to New York. Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, remember me? You were supposed to call me to say good night. It's, like, a rule. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I tried calling. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you di... You didn't call me. I've been sitting here with Khloe, I haven't gotten any phone calls. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: What are you doing in here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, he just hung up on me. Bible, Khloe, I just heard a girl's voice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Was that a girl's voice? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bible, that was a girl's voice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Call him back! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bible, he just hung up on me right when the girl started talking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, call him back. Obviously, he's being shady as , that's why you haven't heard from him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He just pretended to be asleep and then the... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's in bed with a girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She said, "What are you doing in here?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So call him back and say, "Who theis at your house?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You hung up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't hang up on you. Are youkidding me? Are youkidding me? Why would I hang up on you? I'm not an idiot! I just heard a girl speaking in the background, so did Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just hang up on him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He just hung up on me. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's calling me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do, do I answer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, answer the phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See what he has to say. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, shh. Hey, did you have fun with your girl last night? Okay, so that's your explanation? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I mean... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So... Who is this girl? But you shouldn't even be letting her feel comfortable enough to get into your room. To go in your room and get into your bed? After I hear Scott's explanation, I don't want to be stupid, but I believe him for some reason. I just really need to think this through. All right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't think for a second anything about that conversation was honest, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I have to think about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have to think about what? What do you have to think about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have to think about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott has conned his way back into Kourtney's life, and Kourtney's totally, like, "I have to think about it." What do you have to think about? He just said he was in bed with another girl. He said that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just, I'm thinking it through. I don't just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For what? For what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For myself. Who makes that scarf? I think those are cute for the store. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, and they're really light. I got it at Madison. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Will you get it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you expecting someone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Totally. I always do at 10:00 a.m. &gt;&gt; SALES REP: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, how are you? &gt;&gt; SALES REP: Great, a jewelry delivery from XIV Karats. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For who? &gt;&gt; KIM: For who? &gt;&gt; SALES REP: For you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For me? &gt;&gt; SALES REP: Yes, for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: No way, Khloe. &gt;&gt; SALES REP: Rashad wanted you to have something special. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rashad? &gt;&gt; SALES REP: Rashad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rashad asked me to be his girlfriend. And I broke down and I said, "Yes." I finally have a boyfriend, people. Is everybody happy in the world? Rashad is a basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves. And he is covered in tattoos. He raps, too, and he goes to the studio as often as he can. We share all sorts of similarities. We like the same things. We laugh at the same jokes. We just click. &gt;&gt; RASHAD: Come here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get really excited when I know he's coming in L.A. Like, I kind of get anxious, like, really anxious. And I have to talk to Malika, and Malika's like, "Calm down." &gt;&gt; SALES REP: He called up and he said that he wanted you to have some, uh, some diamonds to take a look at, so there's a million dollars in here, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ha, ha, ha. Kim is-- look at Kim's face. She's going to have a heart attack of jealously. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, this is so cool. This is the first time that Khloe's had a boyfriend in years. Khloe has stayed closed off for so long when it comes to relationships. The fact that she's finally let someone into her life, he's got to be an amazing guy. Rashad's got to be the real deal. He must have heard us talking about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, this could be my engagement ring or my wedding ring. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is going to be mine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure. Well, I'm getting these for sure. Die for them. Live 'em, love 'em. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe is getting all these diamonds and I'm very happy for Khloe, but it just makes me sad and think about Scott. &gt;&gt; SALES REP: Diamond link bracelet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love this. Perfect. Don't you love, Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm trying to decide, like, which place would be better to open the second Dash. Like, New York or Miami? &gt;&gt; LILY: Well, I don't know. I feel like Miami seems to be, like, the better place to actually open a store and to, like, do well with. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LILY: Miami's just a different vibe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think it's definitely time that we expand our store, Dash. And Kim, Khloe and I have been thinking a lot about New York or Miami. New York would be really good, too, 'cause Scott has his place there. I could live there. &gt;&gt; LILY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, what do you guys think? Like... about Scott? &gt;&gt; ROYA: It's just, like, you want to be able to trust the person that you're with. You shouldn't have to supervise your boyfriend at all times. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're just having, um, deep, dark convos. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: About what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you guys serious? You guys, that's such a waste of all of our time to even have these conversations. And it's such a waste of your time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I can't discuss anything with you, because you're just so judgmental. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not judgmental, but when someoneup... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, at least Lily and Roya, when I tell them something, they don't, like, hold it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because Lily and Roya are afraid of you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, they're not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not afraid of you. You don't pay me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're not afraid of me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, they are. It's like a really crazy addiction. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're also the exact opposite of me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm a lot stronger than you with guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're, like, a man-hater. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm not. I just don't let people me over. And when you cheat on me, you're gone. You're not going to do it again and again and again. I'm sorry, that's not normal. That's not respect. That's not what boyfriends do to their girlfriends, so I'm not going to let someone do that. I'm being protective and loving you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've seen you-- this guy hurt you repeatedly. You come to me, and now I'm just supposed to act like none of that ever happened and that I'm fine with everything? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I never said to act like nothing happened. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need counseling, you need therapy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't need therapy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need therapy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe's telling me that I need therapy. &gt;&gt; KIM: You might. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She needs therapy for Scott. &gt;&gt; KIM: I definitely think Kourtney needs therapy. I feel like there's no reason that she has to feel like anyone can treat her like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need help. You need somebody-- an outsider looking in to tell you, so I feel like you'd take it more seriously. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause you're not going to listen to us. So it's kind of pointless. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I really just feel that a doctor... &gt;&gt; KIM: You need to talk to someone's that's outside. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...to help you and give you medication. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But what is that going to do? I hate therapists. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's okay. You'll learn on your own when everybody leaves you alone and all you have is your misery and you have nobody else to complain to. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just in the worst mood. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because I've been fighting with my sisters, and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shocking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They just don't get it. Like, I had a fight with Scott and they're just so, like, harsh and hard on me, and like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you think it's interesting that everybody is so quick to judge Scott every time something happens? So there must be something that... Look at my... look at my instincts the very first time you brought Scott home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Remember that night when we had that barbecue? Do you think he's ready for a monogamous relationship? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think Scott cheats on me. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kris, how can you even say that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And if he did, that's between him and I. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm watching you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, but you were wrong about the situation... &gt;&gt; KRIS: The whole texting incident, you know, when he was texting other girls? "My wife"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He has a text message from somebody called "My wife"? And it says, "I loved looking into your eyes last night." When he's with me, he's-he's fine and amazing, and when he's not with me, is whenever we have problems. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And that's not... that's not so good, just beca... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, he's a Gemini. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't care if he's an alien. It doesn't matter to me what he is. If you feel like you have to babysit somebody, or have to worry when he goes out of town or is out of your sight for two hours, that's the wrong guy. I want you to find that person where you just know in your heart, this is the one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And you're not there yet. God gives us one life. Don't waste it on a loser. &gt;&gt; THERAPIST: You're making an excuse for him. Why would you want to be with someone who finds you boring? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am known for being the complete investigator when it comes to boyfriends. &gt;&gt; VOICE: There are two messages that you have previously erased. &gt;&gt; KIM: I got into his voice mail. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hang up, please! &gt;&gt; VOICE: To review messages that have been erased while using the mailbox... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My sisters are forcing me to go to this therapist, and I really, really don't want to go. I haven't visited a therapist since my parents' divorce when I was 11 years old. And the experience was traumatizing. &gt;&gt; BETHANY MARSHALL: Hi, you must be Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; MARSHALL: Hi, Kourtney. I'm Dr. Marshall. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? &gt;&gt; MARSHALL: Good. How are you? It's nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; MARSHALL: Come on in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks. &gt;&gt; MARSHALL: So tell me what brings you here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, my sisters made me come here. &gt;&gt; MARSHALL: What are they concerned about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They just-- I just don't think they like my boyfriend. &gt;&gt; MARSHALL: You want to tell me about him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He has a place in New York and he lives with me here. When he goes home, I think he's like, always seems to be a little shady. Every time he goes, like, I get anxious, and I'm like... &gt;&gt; MARSHALL: What do you mean by "shady"? I guess that's what I'm curious about. What's "shady"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shady is just like, I for sure will, you know, think things like, you know, what if he's off with this person or that person. I don't know, but it's like you really don't know. It's almost like he's like, a caged animal or something when he's here. In Calabasas, it's probably more boring. So I feel like when he gets to New York he's like, excited to go out and party. &gt;&gt; MARSHALL: So what you're doing is you're making an excuse for him. You're saying your life here is boring, so it's natural that the hinges come off the doors. Why would you want to be with someone who finds you boring? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt; MARSHALL: It doesn't matter really what the reason is that he goes out of control in New York. What should matter is that he's not doing what he needs to do in order to be with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have a question. What should I do. Like, I texted him at 1:21. It's now 4:27. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, all you texted was "Hey," so why can't you just call and be like, "Hi." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? That's so lame. Rashad and I text each other like a thousand times a day. Today it's so weird. He normally replies right away. We have to do something. Kim, call him. &gt;&gt; KIM: How am I going to call him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, you always like, are our FBI agent. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am known for being the complete investigator when it comes to boyfriends. Okay, wait, let's try and break into his voice mail. I have so many tricks up my sleeve. No one wants to mess with me. Give me his number, and I'm going to use the secret service to call his own phone from his own number-- his home number. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, you're going to freak me out. I don't want to hear weird messages. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt. This tricks the system to get you right into his voice mail. &gt;&gt; VOICE: You now have the deleted message recovery feature in your mailbox. This feature allows you to review messages that you have previously erased. &gt;&gt; KIM: I got into his voice mail. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hang up, please. &gt;&gt; VOICE: To review messages that have been erased while using the mailbox... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hang up! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do we do? &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot believe I got into his voice mail. Okay, shh. &gt;&gt; VOICE: First unheard message. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hey, Rashad. Had a good time last night. Can't wait to hook up again so we can have an even better time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe-- we just see the look on her face, and she is just-- goes blank. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hey, Rashad. I miss you, baby. Where are you? I haven't talked to you. Call me back. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, she's so shocked. And I think she's really embarrassed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean,this. I just-- I can't handle this. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel so bad. Is she crying? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo... Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel so bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's okay. He's just a piece of What a &gt;&gt; KIM: What an idiot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What an idiot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously. Like, I mean, those messages were... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't had a boyfriend in so long and it's like, I don't trust anybody, and then somebody that, like, really, like, I trust... It's really hard for me to call someone my boyfriend, and you know, I was all in with Rashad and now I just feel really, like, betrayed. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you going to confront him about it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I mean, he has a game tonight, so I'll wait till tomorrow or after the game, but it just sucks. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm definitely nervous that this is going to totally break Khloe's heart and this is going to make it so much more tough for someone to come into her life. We thought she had walls up before. She is definitely going to put up boulders now. I'm sorry, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's okay. It's supposed to happen sometime. Just sucks. Rashad. No. I'm just so confused here. Did you feel like... I'm just so confused on why we're even together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. She looks so nervous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, it's not a fun conversation to have. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: After breaking into Rashad's phone, I decided to check his Facebook emails. I found a ton of other emails that just totally validated everything. You're ajoke. You cannot get out of this one. I saw it with my own eyes. He admitted that he was dating this girl for a couple weeks and I'm like, "A couple weeks?" Like, it's just... Hurts so bad every time. Like, there's just so much lack of respect. At least be clean about your You're sosloppy and embarrassing. He got caught and now he's over it and he's on to the next person. &gt;&gt; KIM: What happened? What did he say? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What could he say? There's nothing to say. Whatever. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did he fess up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, like, I don't want to answer any questions. It's done. It's over with. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, do you feel better? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rashad who? I'll feel better later. I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Seeing how Khloe knew what the right move was for her and she did it immediately, it really shows me what I have to do and I know it's going to hurt. I know that I need to end this once and for all and I'm really anxious about doing so. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We really need to talk. I know that I need to end this once and for all and I'm really anxious about doing so. Yeah. We talked on the phone for over five hours and just went through every little detail about why we really shouldn't be together. I mean, I do love you. That's obviously not the problem. Our relationship was not good the way that it was and I think that we both agreed on that in the end. &gt;&gt; DRIVER: I'm here for the Range Rover. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Hold on one second. &gt;&gt; DRIVER: Sure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For this all with Scott to be fully done, I just take it upon myself to get all his stuff out of my house, ship it off to New York. Scott's car is, like, the final thing to go. I'm sad, but also feel, like, a weight lifted off of me at the same time. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good riddance. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good riddance, honey. Single, ready to mingle. Guess what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like the gloomy city is not going to be good for your spirits. To cheer yourself up, we need to be, like, on yachts every day, sipping mimosas. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In Miami. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am not going to Miami. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, first of all, sunny... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know how much work I just lined up? I need to go do something productive. I just broke up... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Opening a store isn't productive? I decided I'm definitely going to take Dash to Miami for obvious reasons. Scott's in New York, so there's no better place than Miami on the beach. This is where we would live, and, like, they're decorated to die... It's, like, nicer than our house. This is not for your eyes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is single sisters. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE and KOURTNEY: Single sisters only! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm a little bit jealous that I'm not going to Miami but because of my crazy schedule, I wouldn't have time to do that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll think about it, but already New York's been set for me. That's already something that... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But do you want to be in New York alone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: So, you like this rug? &gt;&gt; KIM AND KOURTNEY: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ignore me. I've been looking for you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're trying to pick out the right furniture. Shut up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been looking for you guys, but especially you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you get me a present? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have been thinking long and hard about New York and Miami and I just don't know how well you're going to look in a bathing suit. This happens to be my favorite, okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need... Kourtney, I can't be around someone that won't wear a thong. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're blackmailing me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's the word. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Blackmailing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Blackmail is not allowed. I know I would never, ever, ever wear them in LA, but you never know in Miami. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take these off. Let me help you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like the dog with the suntan lotion. &gt;&gt; KIM: I will not be missing anything in Miami, I can guarantee that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim. Stop. They're high-waisted. &gt;&gt; KIM: Even though I'm not going with them, I'm really excited that Khloe's chosen to go to Miami with Kourtney 'cause I think that they need to be together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop! Oh, God! Kim, I will draw a mustache on your face when you're sleeping if you draw on my butt. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going to miss you guys so much. You guys are going to have the time of your lives. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Miami! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not even funny! It's not funny! It's not funny. What does that do for your life, you freaks? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're going to open a Dash in Miami? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Duh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What happened to New York? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: New York is long gone. That was a phase. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: New York is ancient history. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Latin lovers, bitch! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's actually a really good idea. It'll be like... Remember when we opened Smooch and we decided... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you remember... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do remember that! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't be a smartass. Do you remember, three weeks later, we were up and running. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Up and running! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's really time for the business to grow. They started in Calabasas and it's time for the girls to spread their wings. You should really do that. I think it's a great idea. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. You threw such a bitch fit when I wanted to go to New York. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You were going to New York by yourself. You were going to be alone and now you're going with her. I think it's a great idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you not care about me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love both of you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If this was Kim, you would be in tears. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If this was Kim, you would cry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You got my vote. I'm down. New York. I'll help you pack. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She would literally cry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. She's crazy. Bible, that woman is crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Woo-hoo! Miami!
