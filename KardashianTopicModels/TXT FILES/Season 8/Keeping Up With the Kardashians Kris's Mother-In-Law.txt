- ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a makeup tutorial by Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And she really is gentle, I'll say that. &gt;&gt; KIM: My new thing is jeweled necklaces, 'kay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. &gt;&gt; KIM: But overdoing it. How cool. Do you like it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's so cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so you're into this. Okay, look, I made this one a tight choker. I don't know if it's laying right. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: You think it's cute? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think it's so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Chokers are so in right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: They are? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, wait, look at this dress. Kylie, don't you think this is cool? Look, rhinestones and fluorescent with just a T-shirt. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I like it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie has this amazing Tumblr that just, like, is such an expression of who she is. She'll post these fashion pictures and the style that she's into. And I just know that, like, she's really cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you showing her this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, I'm in the right direction. I'm still cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa, Keeks, I never said you're not cool, freak of the week. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Virginia. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who did your makeup today? It looks horrendous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, then we obviously all have different taste and none of us should comment on each other 'cause if you think that looks good and you think that looks good... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't think I look good? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your under-eyes are so white. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all, you have dark circles under your eyes. No mascara on. You look like a beady little rat with those red eyes. Like, are you kidding? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, Kylie's the only one that matters when it comes to this. What do you think of all of our makeup? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you think Kim looks like a Oompa-Loompa? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, no, I don't think she looks like an Oompa-Loompa. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But I think the eyes are too white. You need some more eyeliner or something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I haven't even looked in the mirror, nor do I care. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And I think you look perfect. ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: What is this thing? I saw you using it. Is it like...? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: A shaker. &gt;&gt; LEAH: A shaker. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's so cool. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. It's amazing how simple an instrument can be, isn't it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's my mother. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't even think I would know what she looks like. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Does she have, like, short hair? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah, she has short hair, she smokes a lot. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: When she looks at you, she closes her eyes and then she looks away and thinks and then she'll look at you and close her eyes and talk to you and you're like, "Are you..." &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my gosh. My mother Esther is 87 years old. Unfortunately, she just lost her third husband. He was 95-- lived a great life. And right now, I think, is a real tough time for her. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey, Grandma, how are you? &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I'm okay. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How are you bearing without Frank? Have you been missing him a bit and everything's all good... &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Oh, my God, it's kind of lonely around here, I'll tell you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Those were some good years. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I'm very, very fortunate I had the time I had with him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My relationship with my mother has kind of had its ups and downs throughout the years. But my mom is older, and I really feel a need that Mom needs to spend more time with my side of the family, and I want to see that happen. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, I love you, Grandma. I'm gonna... I'll call you again soon. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Please do that. I love you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Love you, too. Okay, talk to you soon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Bye. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: She doesn't know I'm here. I never... That voice doesn't sound familiar. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; BRONSON: So, this one comes in black and red. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love the hem. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It looks gorgeous. &gt;&gt; TIM: And then the last print is just for you guys... the unicorn. With Kardashian hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw. That's so cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like Kylie would like that. Kylie, my little sister, I think she's, like, really cool, so she would wear a shirt that's shorter in the front to show a little bit of her belly button. &gt;&gt; TIM: What's happening in the juniors market at the moment, everything is cropped. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you guys like it, "Love Keeps Me Alive"? I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, I'm not trying to be annoying again, but I swear if you guys look on Kylie's blog, she writes all these quotes. No, no, no, I swear. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She doesn't write them. &gt;&gt; KIM: She has the cutest sayings. Like, she just, like, posts. You have to look at her Tumblr. &gt;&gt; BRONSON: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just, like, so her soul, and it's what I want our line to be, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is wrong with you? I think more now that Kim is pregnant, Kim feels like she's losing some of her cool, and she's, like, literally Tumblr-stalks Kylie. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, how she dresses. Like, this is her mood. I just want to be, like, that cool again, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, Kimmy, I love you, but you've got to give it a rest. What would Kylie do? 119 00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,379 &gt;&gt; KIM: WWKD? Kylie would wear it shorter. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's scooter king! See ya, wouldn't want to be ya! &gt;&gt; MASON: Bye, Dad! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: See ya, bud. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Didn't even see you. Okay, so what are we gonna do for the Todd Kraines prank? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't even know about the Todd Kraines prank, so... I literally don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: I literally cry laughing every single time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need to do one right now so Rob... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I can't. I'm getting weirded out about calling your mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? It's almost over. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We started this weird prank to Kourtney's mother that I call her and say that I'm a guy named Todd Kraines, which is one of their oldest family friends, who I don't even know and I have no idea what his voice even sounds like. : Auntie Kris, it's me, it's Todd Kraines. Where are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop calling this number. So, some creep keeps calling me going, "Hi, this is Todd Kraines." It's not funny when someone's sending you flowers. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The girls think it's absolutely hysterical, but I have to do the phone call. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, you guys, silence. Shh! &gt;&gt; ROB: Is it blocked? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Always. &gt;&gt; ROB: Tell her you want to go skiing in Vail. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; JACLYN: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's me, it's Todd Kraines. Is Auntie Kris there? &gt;&gt; JACLYN: Um, this is her assistant Jaclyn. Can I take a message? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Jaclyn, would you tell Auntie Kris I want to take her skiing in Vail? &gt;&gt; JACLYN: Todd Kraines? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it's me. Tell her we're going to Vail next week, ski trip, on me like old times. Can you tell her, please? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom for sure said, "Hang up." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. The best is she's gonna relay that message to her. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, so what do we do? &gt;&gt; KIM: I say that transfer it over to me but where it still goes to her house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Auntie Kris, it's me. Is Kim home?" &gt;&gt; KIM: Why do you have an Egypt tattoo pattern on your computer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks for going through my computer. &gt;&gt; KIM: That looks really cool, that glove. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It does. &gt;&gt; KIM: Now, that is what I call fancy. Delish. So what can I do... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To kill Rob? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...to get on Kylie's blog? I want to be on there more. She puts me every once in a while. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think out of sympathy? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wonder if she puts me out of sympathy. &gt;&gt; KIM: She doesn't do anything out of sympathy. She only does what's cool. That's why I love her. 'Cause she, like, is so authentic. She's, like, the real deal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's 15. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie used to post the coolest pictures of me and my boyfriend on her blog, and she hasn't in a long time, and I'm getting really concerned that I'm losing my cool. Kanye will send me album packaging, like, two options, and send it to me and go, "Which one would Kylie like? Show her." We both think Kylie is just the end-all, be-all of cool. In a way, she makes me feel, like, really old. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's disturbing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. It's so sad. Like, just taking her to the movies the other day, seeing what she was wearing and seeing what her friends talk about in the car on the way, O-M-G. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Should I be concerned if me and her friends and her, like, we have slumber parties and, like, I'm totally on their page? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. No, that means 194 00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:07,707 you're still cool. I feel like their mother. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got a second? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Oh, you know what? I want to give you this before I forget. You have a 30,000-mile service that's due. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I only got 8,000 miles on the car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, what I wanted to talk to you about... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know I've been talking to my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yep. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Her birthday is coming up. I mean, she's 87 years old... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...living out in the middle of nowhere in Idaho, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I-I just thought it might be a good idea that, you know, I go up there for her birthday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a good idea. That's a really good idea. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But I was thinking, you know, maybe you'd go with me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what, I... your mom, first of all, doesn't really like me that much. With all the different run-ins I've had when Esther's come to visit, it might be healthier for our relationship to just have a little bit of space and keep it in a place where I feel good about myself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: First of all, as far as my mother... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...you've had no relationship with her for the last 15-18 years, at least. You've had no relationship... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have seen your mom four times in my life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I've been married to you for 23 years. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So it's not like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: She has yelled at me. I stay away from people like that. When I first met Bruce's mom, I was excited because I was really close and had the most amazing relationship with Robert Kardashian's parents. So, when Bruce's mom and I didn't hit it off right away, it's extremely disheartening. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She doesn't know you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The last time she came to my home, I made her dinner, I made her brownies. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I made her pasta, my favorite soup. I put flowers in her room. I made her feel like a princess. She doesn't even like me. Why would I go visit somebody who can't stand me? Why would I do that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Because she's 87 years old, uh, she's not gonna be around that much longer. From my standpoint, I would like not to really make up... I don't want you to say anything or make up, but just... what... just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Make up? I haven't done anything. She... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just have her see you as you are, 'cause you're a great person. I think it's important, at this point, that Kris mends the relationship with my mom because everybody makes mistakes. I mean, I've made mistakes. Kris certainly has made mistakes. My mom, everybody does. And I want her to go, and not so much do it for my mom, but do it for me, because it's important to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Believe me, she doesn't want me there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It would be a big treat for my mom if you did come, I know that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, do you know where Kylie is? She's, like, been ignoring me, hasn't been returning my calls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's probably sorting out her beanie collection. Third sister. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not funny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, it would mean a lot to me if there was a little connection between you and my mother. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't make it like you're the one... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...who's got this magical relationship, and I'm 263 00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:01,574 the ogre. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have a solution. &gt;&gt; NICK: Yeah, Rob, I got to show you some of the shots that the girls did with Matt. It looks awesome. &gt;&gt; ROB: Good. &gt;&gt; NICK: We need the sock whisperer. Oh. &gt;&gt; ROB: Good. &gt;&gt; MATT: Where'd you find that little dude? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's Kylie's. &gt;&gt; MATT: She brought him? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She brings... She brings him everywhere. &gt;&gt; MATT: She brings that dude everywhere? You're lying. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nope. &gt;&gt; MATT: I thought you were just joking around. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; ROB: You guys are still talking about the Tumblr? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She just keeps sending me stuff. Like, I don't know what to say anymore. What is wrong with Kim? She keeps texting me about my blog, and the most annoying thing about it is that Kim acts magazine or something. I'm over it. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, don't put her on your Tumblr. Like... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm like, "You should make your own Tumblr and, like, put pictures you like." And she was like, "Honestly, if I made my own Tumblr, they would just be pictures of me, so..." &gt;&gt; ROB: I know. Right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is there always this much seaweed in Malibu? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, that's, uh, the kelp there. Goes... kind of goes out and all down Malibu. You like it out here, don't you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, it's beautiful out here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it is nice out here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's just far. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But that's the good part. You want it to be far away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it's very weird that you live out here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I still spend a lot of time at the other house. It's not like I'm here all the time. Speaking of weird, Mom... You know Mom. She holds a grudge. You mess up with her, and, you know, 20 years later, she's still gonna remember that. I don't ask for much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And everybody always says I need to assert myself more, so I tried to push that we go see my mother, and she's like, "No way." I mean, no way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do understand why my mom is hesitant to go visit Esther. She's always been very, like, cold and standoffish to us, and so I could only imagine how she's been towards my mom. I don't know everything. I do just know that she's never really been that friendly. Where does your mom live now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: In Idaho. You know, her third husband died. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. He was 95. I'm really trying to be very firm with this, because it's important to me that my mother really gets to know Kris, because she's a really good person. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, did you say, like, how important it is to you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, and she won't budge. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think holding on to grudges is so unhealthy. I think that he should totally stand his ground and make my mom do it. Like it not, you know, that is a... that's Bruce's mother. I think she should do that for you. This is your mom, and it's important to you... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...and you just have to stand your ground and just, 327 00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:57,773 you know, keep asking her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got on your hood today, huh? I like that. That's bringing the boys back to the yard. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sweating to the oldies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The jig. Oh, my God, since we're ready to rumble, and we're having, like, a little shimmy fun town, I say we do another, "Auntie Kris." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "It's Todd Kraines." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, we have to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We haven't done it in a while. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kendall and Kylie haven't seen it! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my... you guys have never seen Scott in motion? But it's easy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Auntie Kris." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Call! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY &amp; KHLOE: Call! Call! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ♫ You can call Tyrone But you can't use my phone. ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY &amp; KHLOE: Call! Call! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, Scott! Come on! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It is so annoying. I don't want to keep calling your mom every day with it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, what are you talking...? We don't do it every day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like a once-in-a-month thing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All I want to do is just tell Kris. I mean, the girls are using me like a puppet every time they see me. "Call my mom, call my mom, pretend you're Todd Kraines." I'm like, "I don't want to call your mom!" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Since you're on your phone, guess what time it is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, come on with this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just hush your face, call Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I'll call, I'll call, I'll call. : Auntie Kris, it's me. It's Todd Kraines! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's do a Todd Kraines prank. Come on, Todd Kraines it up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's me. It's Todd Kraines. And to be honest, it's getting a little time-consuming, and it's become a job for me. And I think we all realize, the Lord does not like working. It's almost hard labor, and I'm done with it. You guys don't want... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What about for us? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It breaks my heart not to do it for you guys, but Kourtney and Khloe have ruined the pranking privileges. I'm not T.K. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Please! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How about...? You know what? I just reconsidered. I'm gonna actually go... No! No! No! Every time that you even think about asking, I'm just gonna say, "No!" ♫ No, no, no, no, no! &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you know where Kylie is? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think she's in her room. Have you checked there? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. She's, like, been ignoring me, hasn't been returning my calls. She's not in her room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's probably sorting out her beanie collection. Okay, third sister? You made fun of me for the last year for being the "fourth sister" and trying not... like, I don't act my age, and you come in here looking like the third little sister. Are you my teenager? &gt;&gt; KIM: Not funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good try. 386 00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,211 I love it, Kim. Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If Scott talks me into buying one more set of tires, I'm going to lose my mind. It's such a waste of money. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, can we talk my mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To be honest with you, I think it would be kind of unfair to kind of force you to go up there to see her for her birthday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, I would do my best, but I'm just so darn busy and trying to... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have a solution. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get a plane, pick her up in Idaho, bring her up here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And have a-a dinner, try to get as many kids as we can get, and then put her on a plane and send her back. And that way, she's, you know, kind of on your territory, and, you know, you don't have to go anywhere. It's just dinner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Obviously, my home is open to her, but I'm not quite so sure about my schedule, and I'll do my best to be around. I think after years and years, I finally realized that I want to be in a place where I want to surround myself with really positive energy and be with the people I know love me and care about me and want me to be around in a really positive way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But, you know, it would mean a lot to me if there was a little connection between you and my mother. Doesn't have to be a lot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to tell you that in 23 years, I think you've mentioned her name a dozen times. Don't make it like you're the one who's got this really magical relationship with your mom, and I'm like the-the ogre. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm not saying that, I'm not... This is getting too complicated. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm happy to have... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It would mean a lot to 418 00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,027 me if we did that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Great, have her come. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, we're calling Todd Kraines, the real Todd Kraines. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am, like, really nervous that Todd might get pissed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, it's ringing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce's mom-- what she missed out on for 23 years. 426 00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:22,323 &gt;&gt; RHONDA: But that's her issue. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That'sup. &gt;&gt; KIM: When I just filled out my stem cell cord blood thing... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...it said, "In the past five years, have you ever had sex in exchange for money?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: And then it said, "In the past five years, have you ever had sex in exchange for drugs?" Like, the craziest questions. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if you have to any of them? You can't do this thing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you down with me calling Todd Kraines from your house phone and seeing if he answers? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, we're calling Todd Kraines, the real Todd Kraines? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Todd Kraines has been a family friend of ours since before I was even born. My real dad and my mom are family friends with them, and then they all had kids around the same time, so we've known them forever. And since Scott is over this Todd Kraines prank, Kourtney came up with the best idea: to call the real Todd Kraines. I am, like, really nervous that Todd might get pissed. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll talk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, it's ringing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why isn't he answering? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Then he'll come to the front door. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who answers blocked numbers? &gt;&gt; TODD: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Toots. &gt;&gt; TODD: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Toots. &gt;&gt; TODD: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's Kim and Kourtney and Khloe. &gt;&gt; TODD: Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I swear. You're not with your mom, are you? &gt;&gt; TODD: Why would I be with my mom? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. Okay, so we have a confession to make. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't be mad at us. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney and Scott and Khloe have been prank-calling my mom, pretending to be you. &gt;&gt; TODD: You've got to be me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, but we... &gt;&gt; TODD: You understand what I've been going through with your mother? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, you cannot tell her, you can't tell her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not yet. &gt;&gt; TODD: Do you know how many times she's called me, going, "Have you been sending me champagne at Nobu?" And I was like, "Well, no, but how was your dinner?" I was like, I was like, "Auntie Kris," I'm like, "It's not me, I don't know what's going on, but I'm actually really concerned." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's the funniest thing in the world, but now we want to, like, end the prank and we want... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We can't do it anymore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So we were like, we thought it would be funny if you showed up at her house and then, and... ...and then, like, we could have the guard call and be like, "Todd Kraines is at the gate," and then my mom will be like, "No, don't let him in." &gt;&gt; TODD: Okay, so when do you want to do this? This is hilarious. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you around on Monday? &gt;&gt; TODD: Um, yeah, I can make myself available. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; TODD: This is classic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is gonna be so amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's gonna die. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks, Todd. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye, Toddy Dice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, bye. So funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is amazing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank God he's in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Could you imagine if he was like, "you guys"? &gt;&gt; KIM: I hate that my face is so fat that it looks like I have all this Botox, 'cause when I smile, it's like... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, but everyone knows you. You're not doing that. Anyway, where are we going, by the way? Where are you dragging me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's go to, like, Melrose. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Melrose? &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to get some inspiration of cool things, like, of what to dress like... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Run that by me again. For what? &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to find, like, new, cooler things. Kylie has this blog. She has really cool style, and I love how she puts it all together. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She's got that hipster style. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to see what the young crowd is about. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All right, here we go. This is the Melrose part that 509 00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:46,651 everybody's, like, cool and edgy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want Kylie to remember that I have cool style and cool taste. I used to die to walk up and down Melrose. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Look at this. That's very inspiring. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie would wear that for sure. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That-that red thing she would definitely wear. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe would wear that. Wait, hold on. Let me take a pic. Okay. I'm gonna send this to Kylie. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Do you feel inspired? &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel inspired. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, sit in here with us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm coming. I'm just getting a glass of wine. I'll get it. Who is on the phone? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The gate. It was Todd Kraines. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Todd Kraines is at the gate? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Todd Kraines... You're such a bull! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Swear on my life, Todd Kraines was just... They just said that. I'm not making it up. Bible. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Todd Kraines is at the house? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They just said, "Todd Kraines is at the gate," and you said, "Okay." What if it's thefake Todd Kraines?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris, I think, has always had the impression that she wasn't that close to you. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I can feel it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. So just take her off to the side and just, 539 00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:09,535 you know, make everybody feel better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They just said, "Todd Kraines is at the gate," and you said, "Okay." What if it's thefake Todd Kraines?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, what are they gonna do? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean, "What's he gonna do?" There's nuts people in this world! He could be with a friggin' sawed-off shotgun! Doorbell! &gt;&gt; KIM: That's the door! Let's just go get it! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The door rang. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? You're pregnant! What do you need to go out there for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not answering the door, Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll answer it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: How do you see 554 00:23:39,696 --> 00:23:43,461 if it's him from here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney... &gt;&gt; TODD: Surprise! Auntie Kris, it's me, Todd Kraines. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Toddy Dice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing here? Why do you keep calling me? I keep hanging up on you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's me. It's Todd Kraines! Auntie Kris, it's me! It's Todd Kraines! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We've been doing this to you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: The whole time? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah, we got nothing better to do. &gt;&gt; TODD: I'm so flattered, really. &gt;&gt; KRIS: These kid are nuts. To play a prank on somebody is one thing, but to carry it out for months, knowing how terrified I was at times? I don't know whether to kiss them or kill them. You, the real Todd Kraines. Mwah! That's who I love. With the non-creepy voice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's us! 573 00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:38,551 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's Todd Kraines! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kraines! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Cheers. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: This is actually really good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was gonna make some brownies when I got home, because... &gt;&gt; RHONDA: Were you now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...Bruce's mom is coming into town. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: Have I ever met her? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In all these years. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: Are you close with her? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: When was the last time you saw her? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe ten years ago. Um, I don't think she's really crazy about me. I didn't feel like we had a connection. And then I had Kendall and Kylie, and I just really never heard from her very much. She wasn't happy with me, wasn't gonna connect with me. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: That's... that's horrible. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The problem is... &gt;&gt; RHONDA: What's the problem? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...she doesn't know the kind of person I am. Had she known what she missed out on for 23 years... You just missed 18 years of your grandchildren growing up. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: I-I understand. But that's her issue. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That'sup. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: No, it is up, but that's her issue. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wanted to say to her, "If you could even for five seconds be inside the relationship..." Why am I crying? &gt;&gt; RHONDA: Because this is emotional. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That-- No, but that I had with Robert's parents. It's like, why don't you just enjoy your life? I don't get it. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: But now what are you doing? She's coming back into your life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: I'm thinking this is a great thing. This could be your time to make some amends with her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is with all you people and the amends? &gt;&gt; RHONDA: I-- Honestly, I just think it's important to tie things up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, look at this outfit. This is my outfit, head to toe. And my shoes? Oh, I want to kill her. Like, what makes her think she can just go in my closet? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You pissed? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, livid. Livid. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Esther, hi! &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Boy, it's been years. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Good to see you! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's kind of awkward. 618 00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:37,828 There's no eye contact, and I just hope she can realize &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: So rude. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want a craving, just a Mexican food craving. Got a photo of me stuffing my pregnant face. I, like, can't fit any more food in my stomach, but I'm still hungry. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: How is that possible? &gt;&gt; KIM: There's a human in there taking up the space. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, I forgot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie was out and went to this premiere. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: They go to premieres now? I can't believe they go to premieres. Scary. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. Oh, my God, look at this outfit. This is my... And my shoes? This is my outfit, head to toe. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Well, I've seen those shoes before. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're, like, brand-new Balmain shoes. I wore them one time in New York. Kylie doesn't have the time to respond to me, but yet she snuck into my closet and stole my clothes. I am livid. Oh, I want to kill her. Like, what makes her think she can just go in my closet and not ask me? I don't play that. 641 00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:50,714 Like, ask me. Little snake. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Can we come in? &gt;&gt; KIM: We can barge in. She barged into mine. Nice... outfit you wore to the premiere. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where did you get it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I used the closet. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you're gonna have, like, the balls to break into my house and borrow my clothes without asking, you can have at least the decency to text me back when I text you things. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I agree, I agree. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Text back? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'll text... I'll text you back. And I apologize. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're so sincere. What a sincere teen you are. I'm not gonna take this personally. I'm gonna excuse her being a little brat and rude as just that she's being a typical teenager. Why should I even care? I've been a stylist for years, way before Kylie even knew anything about fashion. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All right, Kylie. We'll be watching. She could care less, by the way. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's so uninterested. 661 00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:55,402 &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Nothing you said has resonated to her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How was it seeing your sister? &gt;&gt; ESTHER: It was bittersweet. She'll be 90 in J-July 21. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow, well, you're still going strong at 87, Mom. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Pretty good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Believe me, I got my back in... back in shape. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, that's good. Can you handle all the parties? &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got to party with all the grandkids. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's one thing that I would like to see happen tonight. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris, I think, has always had the impression that, um, you know, she wasn't that close to you. She's just always felt distant from you, you know? &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I know. I could feel it. You know, I-I have never felt that I could reach out to Kris. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: She's sort of, you know, kept-kept me... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Always been a little distant, yeah. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What I would love to see happen... you know, just take her off on the side and just, you know, you can tell her, "You know what? Love you. I appreciate what you've done." We've built a great life together. So just take her off on the side and just, you know, make everybody feel better. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now my mom is concerned, I know Kris is concerned. You know, I set this whole thing up. I just hope it works. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: All of a sudden, my mouth is so dry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, now we'll go there and we'll get you a drink, Mom. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Uh, yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I'll get you back to your room. Don't worry about it. 696 00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:28,451 &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Knock-knock! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; LEAH: My arms are gonna fall off. This is the cake. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't wait to eat it. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Mmm, can we start with the cake? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me see. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Look how cute it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. So beautiful! Wait, are these from your garden? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Where is everybody? Bruce isn't home? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He went to go get your grandmother. I decided to keep this more of a Jenner family dinner than involve my Kardashian side of the family, because I know how protective they are, and I didn't want to go to that place tonight. I'm really hopeful that when Esther comes to visit today that we can find a way to be family. You know Kim and Kanye are moving in? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim took the guest room, emptied it out. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Huh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is what's been going on in my house. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Lots of baby stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And look what she did to my guest room: "Hi, Mom." &gt;&gt; LEAH: Wow! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then she decided she didn't like the navy blue tile in the bathroom, so she's gonna redo all the tile. &gt;&gt; LEAH: No! Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It changes daily. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Wait a second, but... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What? But it matches this. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Well, you know... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but she's changing all of it. &gt;&gt; LEAH: She's nesting. What can I say, right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hey! Esther! Hi! Good to see you. I'm glad you're visiting. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Why, thank you, dear. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's kind of awkward. There's no eye contact. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How are you? Mwah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just hope she can relax a little bit and loosen up 735 00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:06,499 and realize that I'm not the enemy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Kimberly. &gt;&gt; KIM: We need to look in your closet and see what clothes I lent you, because I feel like I'll never get them back. I'm actually not gonna let Kylie get away with this teenager card. Kylie needs to show some respect. If I'm not good enough for her Tumblr, then she's not good enough for my clothes. I did not give you that dress. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I really wanted a little time with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In 23 years that I've known her, she's never wanted to have any kind of talk with me. 747 00:32:34,427 --> 00:32:37,127 Makes me a little nervous 'cause I don't know what this is &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim took the guest room, emptied it out. &gt;&gt; LEAH: She's nesting. What can I say, right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Esther! Hi! Good to see you! I'm glad you're visiting. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Why, thank you, dear. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When you really want somebody's approval, and you never get it for 23 years, it is very hurtful. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Look at your grandsons. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Look at that. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How are you? Mwah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi. &gt;&gt; BURT: How are you doing? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really need to be in the room under construction? &gt;&gt; BURT: What's in here? &gt;&gt; LEAH: This is gonna be, uh, Kim's baby's room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This was where you were gonna stay. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Oh? 765 00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,650 &gt;&gt; KRIS: But Kim suddenly changed it into a baby's room. Bruce, why don't you get everybody a drink. I hope that Esther can find a way not to judge me anymore. And I hope that she can just see the love that we all have for each other and enjoy it. Would you like a glass of white wine? &gt;&gt; ESTHER: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Would you like a cocktail? &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I would like a cocktail. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What would you like? &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Do you have a Canadian whiskey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go over there and take a look, Mom, find what you want. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Does anything look familiar? I know there's an Armenian whiskey. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Let me have some of the Irish whiskey and 7 Up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Irish whiskey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To be honest with you, my mom has lived a very simple life, but with Kris, her life is kind of over the top. The bottom line is, Kris is just a good ol' down-home girl just like my mom is. They just got to get to know each other. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah? &gt;&gt; ESTHER: You need to put a little weight on. You're skinny like me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here you go. I didn't even stir it. Just the way you said you liked it. Wait, but what do you call it when you don't stir it? You said... I know. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Oh, don't bruise it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't bruise it. Don't bruise the drink. Bruiser. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You guys want any of this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This looks so good. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I'm in heaven. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh-oh, Leah... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ..eating an oyster; aphrodisiac. This could be the night. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hello! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is the first time in years that I've got the whole kind of Jenner side of the family together, including my mother. And, uh, I hope that everybody gets along. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I don't think I ever want to get married again. Not at this stage. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you gonna live in sin, Mom? Come on. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I'm not gonna live in sin, no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, who cares at this point? Go for it. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I know. I can't get pregnant. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: And whoever it was couldn't even... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Probably get it going anyway. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Couldn't get it up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Geez. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Too late. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So far, it seems to be working out pretty well. It's great to see all of my side of the family together. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: One of my doctors said, "Obviously you're not a smoker." &gt;&gt; LEAH:Really? &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Uh-huh. I said, "You know, I smoke non-filter cigarettes. It's the filters that'll kill you." &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God. Esther! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here it is. Ready? &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Oh, it's beautiful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! Leah made that cake, baby. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I'm gonna make the same wish I wished two years ago, when you were all there, that I would hear from my grandchildren once in a while. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, good job, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. I'm so happy you're here. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Y-You're not eating. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna go take care of Kim. I hate to be rude and leave the dinner early, especially when Esther's being so warm and fuzzy to me, but I have to get up at 5:00 a.m. because I promised Kim I'd take her to her appointment. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: This is very good, this Irish whiskey, and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's probably the secret to your youth. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I'm not sassy at 87 years old, I'm gonna be really happy about that. Good night, everybody. &gt;&gt; BURT: Good night. Have a good night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, guys. Love you. &gt;&gt; BURT: Adios. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This has not been an easy process. The two of them really didn't get together tonight and hash this thing out. We've only got a little time left, and there's a lot of unfinished business here. That's important to me, and I want to see that happen. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Do you... do you like scallops? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I hope Kris likes leftovers. &gt;&gt; ROB: Those aren't even good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Must be nice. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; ROB: Must be nice to fill your face with fattening food. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yup, and Rob and I are just wishing we were you. Mmm, just smell it. Smell your calories. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't really like 855 00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:32,570 these type of desserts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Doesn't it smell good? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Kimberly. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to look in your closet and see what clothes I lent to you, because I feel like I'll never get them back. So I'm gonna come up now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It was this coat. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There's this one, which I'm obsessed with. &gt;&gt; KIM: That orange? Hot orange? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, yeah, this one's yours and I'm not gonna wear it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're not? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And then there's stuff that you, like, gave-gave me, which is like... &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't care about that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This dress and... &gt;&gt; KIM: I did not give you that dress. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, you let me borrow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so let me have it back. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You want it back? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's very expensive. Yeah, if you're not gonna wear it. What else did you think I gave you? Okay, you want to hand me this Burberry coat? Cool. Kylie has a closet full of my clothes. She cannot just dismiss me and think that she can just go into my closet and take things without asking. Our parents taught us how to respect at a young age, and for some reason, Kylie does not have that, so she needs to be more respectful. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have a lot of your 882 00:38:40,757 --> 00:38:43,290 stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. Um, yeah, do you want me to deal with this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Since the big conversation didn't happen last night, I went over to the hotel, picked up my mom, and now I've brought her to the house. I'm just hoping for the best. That's all I can do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, love you, too. Just another day at the office. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: It was nice to have the gathering outside last night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wasn't that nice? The kids loved seeing you, too. That was really sweet that you came. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: You know, honey, I really wanted a little time with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In 23 years that I've known her, she's really never wanted to have any kind of talk with me. Makes me a little nervous, 'cause I don't know what this is all about. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: You know, we haven't been close in any way. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: You know, honey, I 901 00:39:47,145 --> 00:39:50,110 really wanted a little time with you. You know, we haven't been close in any way. And I'm so sorry for that. I wish I could've been closer to you, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw. It was very complicated, I think, you know. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Mm-hmm, very. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just a lot of personalities in the mix. And a lot of stuff going on, so I think it's hard to get to know someone... &gt;&gt; ESTHER: But I-I have felt like I should... stay away, stay out of the picture. Uh, and I have. But... it's not right. You're Bruce's... you're Bruce's wife. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, 23 years. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Yeah, and the longest marriage he's had. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: And it's-it... You've been good for him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's been good for me. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: And I think he's been good for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Wow, I've waited 23 years to hear this, and she's finally thanking me for being a part of her son's life. It's kind of huge. You have a really good son there. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You raised him really, really well. You know, for me, better late than never. Life is too short to hold a grudge and to hang on to things that I'll never be able to change, but really glad that we can be at this place. It was so good to see you. I'm glad that you came and made everybody so happy, and got to see your grandchildren. That's the most important thing. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: It made me so happy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; ESTHER: Oh, I'll go... I'll go home singing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mom's on the plane. Congratulations, you survived it. I know it was a little bit of... Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're telling me congratulations? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're just so happy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But she was great. No, she was great. Absolutely great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I mean, thank you for making that happen. 'Cause it really meant a lot to her. The whole thing just worked out great. Mom was as happy as can be. Told me I was her favorite child. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, Kim should know how you feel. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was all good. No, it was a great birthday present for her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, well, that's good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, all good. Good! I love it! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just think that one thing you should learn from all of this... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...because this makes you so happy, that you should pay more attention to your mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God, okay. It's so... Everybody should. Yeah, but she lives all the way in Idaho. The lesson to be learned here is, you know what? I stuck to my guns. Everything came together, I stayed strong, and it was great at the end. That's a good lesson to learn. Everything was so good. Everything was so good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'm just saying stay in touch. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I do! I talk to her, uh, three or four times a week now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No... Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you have learned how good this makes her feel. So keep the good feelings rolling for her. She's not gonna be here forever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. And now that you've established a great relationship, you can call her, too. Good-bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so freakin' lucky. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... I want to feed them placenta. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What you making? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Placenta pasta. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You guys are just sick. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There you go.
