- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In the Urban Sweat Lodge. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Beware, Kourt. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: All right, how cute you look. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, glamorous. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So you're gonna be laying down in these beds. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: And you're gonna be laying there for an hour. You're gonna burn between 800 and 1,600 calories. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So you lose a little weight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Praise God. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Let's do it. 12 00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:27,628 Have a good sweat, you guys. &gt;&gt; BOTH: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aren't you excited to just, like, lay and relax? 16 00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:41,074 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dude, I can't talk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My ass is on fire. Your ass isn't on fire? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dude... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that you have more skin on your butt, so you feel it more. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi, guys. How is it going? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, you're sweating good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You're a good sweater. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am a good sweater. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You're both, yeah. This is good. Not yet. Well, I'll be back in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Thirsty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you escaping? I can't see you. And I don't have any arms. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, shut up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't even had a sip. Please? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have to pee so badly now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You must made me pour it on my face. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't really look so hot. So maybe you should get out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's have a pool of sweat. Du-du-duh! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Wonderful. Very well done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I cannot wait for this labor to happen. I could only imagine Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I just want her to be realistic. What if she doesn't have time for glam? She said that when she meets her baby, she just wants her to think she's beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The baby won't remember. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim looks so much prettier with no makeup on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agree. Well, I think she's gorgeous with no makeup on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really do. Wait. Kim is calling me. Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, why is it every glam person that I'm trying to book is on hold for your glamorous birth delivery? &gt;&gt; KIM: I can narrow it down if you want. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you sure that you want to be in full glam while you give birth? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is so over the top. She wants to get her makeup done and her hair done. And I think it's a little bit unrealistic, because you just don't know how things are gonna go down when it's time to give birth. Do you know how pretty you are with no makeup on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Then I just need a spray tan. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I need a was. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I haven't gotten a wax in so long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't do anything. You're, like, from the '70s. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm '70s chic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not chic, 67 00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,596 honey. That is sick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Which way should we go, Kourtney? This way or this way? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This way or this way? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This shows how much I'm confused about my life. So I actually had a really good time with MJ this week because I took her to go see condos here in L.A. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Condos? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's been talking about that for years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For three years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, ten years. Papa's been gone for ten years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: MJ is a our grandmother. She has her life in San Diego, but we all want MJ to move to L.A. to be closer to us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! &gt;&gt; MJ: So glad to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You, too! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: MJ was with my grandfather for, like, 40 years. I just can't imagine how devastated she was after losing him. And we just want her to have company. &gt;&gt; KIM: She has told me numerous times that she's really lonely. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I think that she's got one relative down there and her friends and her life, but she's got all of us up here. My mom has turned down my offer to get her a condo up here in Los Angeles. And it kind of breaks my heart a little bit. I don't want her to be lonely. So, then what do you do? Do you have her uproot her whole life and move up her and hope for the best? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, she needs a man, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Gee, we just, I mean, it's been ten years. I feel like she can just have, like, a friend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But how? Where is she gonna meet somebody? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, like, a bar. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Golf course? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's not gonna go to a bar, and she doesn't golf. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why can't she go to a bar? The Del Mar Fair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The Del Mar Fair? Are you kidding? That's where teenagers hang out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And old people take their grandkids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do they have for her age group? For her demographic? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's, like, probably oldpeoplemeet.com. &gt;&gt; KIM: The older you get the more your ears and nose grows, and I'm gonna be so freaked out if I had to meet someone new at that age. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My ears are gonna grow? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your ears have definitely gotten bigger. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe you can, like, cut off half your lobe, make 'em appear smaller. No, seriously, that's what I'm gonna do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, your belly pops so much. It's so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, thanks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me touch her. Hi, my little shnookers, shnooker, shnooker. &gt;&gt; KIM: Karl Lagerfeld's, like, "You don't look pregnant," you know? And I was, like, "Um, yeah, I do." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are people asking me if you're pregnant? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Probably 'cause my stomach is so out of control that it's not normal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Will you be quiet? You are soweird. First of all, we were in... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's so out of control. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, are you having triplets in there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at these wrinkles. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who squeezes their belly like that? Kourtney, you look great. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I have to get my hospital bag. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I told you to do that yesterday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to get it ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are they gonna get you out of the hospital? &gt;&gt; KIM: No idea. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Exactly how you got out of the hospital. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, how do I book a hospital? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait-- you haven't booked a hospital room? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, we haven't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you still had time to call your glam squad? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Typical Kim; she hasn't booked her hospital room and she hasn't even packed her hospital bag yet, but the glam squad is on hold and ready to go. Hey, it's Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to book the hospital. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's different rooms to get. You need the private. You need to book... &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want that big room in the corner. But I don't know how it works. Like, I obviously have no idea when I'm gonna go into labor. What is someone else is 149 00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:53,546 and they want that same room? Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is nice. I got you driving, and I can actually look at my little text messages. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All the text messages you get. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How much longer till you're licensed? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Like, a month and, like, 16 days or something. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah! And my last one will be driving. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Paparazzi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, it's really bad if we go to the house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: These are all paparazzi. I'm scared to get my license because my car looks exactly like Kim's. As Kim's due date gets closer, the paparazzi have just been insane. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let us get out of the car at least. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZI: Kim! Kim! &gt;&gt; MAN: Make a hole! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: When the paparazzi can't find Kim, they just stalk the rest of us. I know I'm gonna be followed, like, everywhere. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it drives me nuts. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I, like, never want to drive anywhere alone. It's just scary. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It really bothers me that Kylie is afraid to get her license because she's afraid to be driving around having these guys follow her. Probably one of the most exciting times in a young person's life is the day they got their driver's license. I don't want these stupid paparazzi guys to take that away from Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are they following us anymore? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Two of 'em are. Three of 'em are. Keep driving, Kylie. Don't keep looking in the rearview mirror. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad, I'm driving. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't worry about the paparazzi. We'll deal with that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: When will we deal with it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Pull off right here. There's a place. Oh, my God, look at 'em. I don't get mad very often, but these guys are really ticking me off. I don't want 'em following my daughter. That's just dangerous. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Put it in park. you, buddy. Quitfollowing my family. You hear me? You Quit following! &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Why don't you calm down? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not gonna calm down. Youcalm down. You hear me? Get a life! Hey, you bigchicken! Get theout of here. Buddy, you better get the out of here! You hear me? Get in yourcar and get out of here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He sped off, like, pedal to the metal, so I was hit by the car, but I wasn't ran over by it. Can't you press charges for, like, them trying to assault me with a vehicle? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Now we have a look at the baby. The head is down pretty low on the pelvis. This is not good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you having fun? You I'm just sick of these guys. Get alife! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Get in the car! I rarely see my dad this upset, but it's understandable. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't take that from these guys. You know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: They have just gotten way too crazy, and they're all not really caring about safety. Like, if five guys, men, are following me, and I'm 16 years old, shouldn't that be illegal? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You would think so. Kim, you know, she gets stalked all the time. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know how she does it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm the same way. I don't know how she does it. It would drive me crazy if I walked out of my house and there were, you know, 20 people out there, taking a damn picture. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I-I would not take that. For our family, all the time that we've been in the public eye, the paparazzi thing has never gotten so out of hand as it is now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's not Kim's fault, obviously, but it's just like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it's just circumstances. They-they're, like, stalking all the rest of the family. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 'Cause they're trying to find her, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They want that picture of Kim even more now that she's pregnant. Just ridiculous. I'm gonna call Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kimmy! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're stalking us. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I wish you were there. Dad jumped out of the car and screamed. I've never never seen him so mad. He screamed at all of them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know how you do it, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Now we have you going crazy, Rob going crazy; all the males in our family want to protect us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I... If they just weren't so obnoxious. &gt;&gt; KIM: The things they yell to 241 00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,486 you, it's so obnoxious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are we doing? Oh, I hate those flowers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They smell really bad, huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're gonna sign MJ up for seniormatch.com. Seniority rules. Kim and I are setting MJ up on a senior dating site. I do wish that MJ had someone that she could be with, whether it be romantic or not. I think she deserves that. "Number one dating site for baby boomers and seniors." What's a baby boomer? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That means, like, young, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that's, like, Mom's age. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew, Mom's called a baby boomer? Hopefully, we can find MJ a little boy toy or a grandpa toy. &gt;&gt; KIM: What should my profile headline be? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Spicy, petite grandma. &gt;&gt; KIM: Grandmother, so sweet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's a cougar. &gt;&gt; KIM: Does she want to meet a white man, Hispanic, Latino? What's Pacific Islander? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The Pacific coast. I have no idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: No preference. Oh, look at all these people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That guy looks like Bob Saget. Ew, who is that guy? &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, old people are not attractive. Why is this young guy on here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That guy is, like, 20. Oh, I like this guy. How cute is he? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, he has rosacea. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's five-ten. He's athletic, light brown, blue eyes, good-looking. I'm down with that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want him to be my new grandpa. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's like famous people. We're living in a confined space. Do you know where I got that line from? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, Britney Spears. "Hit Me, Baby, One More Time." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, how'd you know? &gt;&gt; ROB: I just listened to Britney's whole first three albums. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, that pisses me off you can't do anything about it. &gt;&gt; ROB: What are you gonna do, though, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what I'm saying, call your attorney? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have a minute? This just happened. Um, I was at my mom's house, and we saw, like, paparazzi, like, in the bushes, like, taking pictures. Kourtney, like, yelled, and they scattered and got in their car, and so I was gonna take a picture of their license plate. And then when I was leaving, they kept, um, like, stomping on the brakes so I could hit them. I pulled in front of them, and I just said, "You guys should not be taking pictures and also do not drive like that. I would just like your drivers license please. Um, and we could exchange information." He sped off, like, pedal to the metal. So I was hit by the car, but I wasn't ran over by it. Like, he could've really hurt me. He says what do you want him to do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Something needs to happen to them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can't you press charges for, like, them trying to assault me with a vehicle? &gt;&gt; LAWYER: This truth is that they'll call it a "road rage incident," and they'll put you as a suspect/victim because you got out of your car and you approached them while they were in their car. And so, uh, it could turn ugly as far as publicity goes. That's just the hard, you know, naked truth of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Perfect. &gt;&gt; LAWYER: I'll try to at least write a report. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; LAWYER: Yeah, good talking to you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, you, too, bye. &gt;&gt; ROB: As much as it sucks, you just have to, like, ignore it. Like, I learned thatthe worst. You're not gonna win. It's just gonna be a headache for you, and nothing's gonna come out of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you feel comfortable that people could, you know, attempt to murder you with a vehicle... &gt;&gt; KIM: As soon as I pop this thing out, as soon as I get in shape... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...the first thing I or some nude shoot. I just want to, like, walk down the street, like, fully naked. You have no idea. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so adventurous. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna be, like, the sexy, hot mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? You just want to get your sexy back? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you want to go and do, like, some naked photo shoot, we could start by going outside. The amounts of paparazzi that are here, it is so... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I said when I'm skinny again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...redonkulous. And how aggressive they are, it's really only getting worse. Like, I'm really getting, like, scared, especially for you. We're definitely used to the paparazzi following us. Like, you know what you're signing up for. I just think that there should be some boundaries when it comes to kids and pregnant people. I am completely scared for Kim. It's definitely dangerous. It makes me so scared now that you have a baby inside of you and now that you're gonna go into labor. That's not... They'll do anything. It's like Princess Diana. The swarms... &gt;&gt; KIM: I am not Princess Diana. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not saying you're Princess Diana. I'm not saying that. I'm saying how aggressive they were with her, and then, like, the outcome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that we need to make a serious plan for when you go into labor. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, we will. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll think of it, and we need to call security and, like, figure it out with them. Kim is so great at dealing with the paparazzi that, you know, she sometimes doesn't even realize how dangerous some of these situations can be. You have no idea how things are gonna go down when it's time to give birth. Paparazzi and being in a traffic jam is not what Kim is gonna want to deal with. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, seriously, though, I'm not Princess Diana. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We've got some potential guys, and we got their phone numbers. Just to protect MJ, we're gonna go through a phone screening process. &gt;&gt; MAN: I appreciated her spunk. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Just to be safe about this, we're gonna run a few blood tests. &gt;&gt; KIM: I could be having this 357 00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,707 baby a lot sooner than I thought. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you go to Boris? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What'd he say? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got a sinus cold. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want me to make you some ginger tea? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mm-mmm. I feel like you're gonna put, like, some organic crap in it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did Kim ever tell you about the profile that we set up for MJ? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What profile? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? For dating? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does MJ know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, she doesn't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Pull it up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. So..."Frisky" Ooh, from San Diego! "Something easy and casual. You drive. Big Dog" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Big Dog? He's got to be a thruster. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hold on, we gotta pick a few peeps. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but how are we gonna get MJ to meet with these guys if she doesn't even know you're gonna do this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're gonna go and meet a few of them, like three or four, and just filter and see if we like any of them. And if we don't... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: By the way, that's so rude. The guy's gonna look at you guys and think he's getting some 30-year-old &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, he's not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hopefully, this all works out, because MJ needs a companion, so I hope we find someone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so who's meeting them? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We need to get a few more e-mails first. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We could meet them at Soup Exchange. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have to do, like, the early bird special. 388 00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,484 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on in. &gt;&gt; DELIVERYMAN: How are you? Delivery. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love that. Love that. &gt;&gt; DELIVERYMAN: We'll get it set up for you today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wouldn't mind living here. &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's a good party house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nothing. Here with Leah at the Malibu house. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Leah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just gonna get my nails done because I can't have black nails when I deliver. It's a little too, like, for me. I need, like, light pink nails. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. 'Cause she'll remember that. &gt;&gt; KIM: She will. She'll have photos that she'll probably be Instagramming in 20 years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Keeks... Well, I want to hang out with Leah and I'll call you later. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. She is truly insane. Could you walk around at all... like, do your hair and makeup every day and get your nails done twice a week? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my gosh. I would totally go crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If it was like the where you guys just woke up in different lives, she would, like, be insane. &gt;&gt; LEAH: We actually talked about it, because my life is so much different than hers. When we went to Kim's house, she said that she was gonna get makeup done every single day till she gave birth. And I... honest to God, I thought she was kidding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. She's not. 100%. Even though the family has been telling her to start focusing on, like, getting a hospital room, packing a bag... How are you going to get to the hospital? Who's gonna take you home? Kim is like, "Oh, it will all fall into place eventually." But she can't stay pregnant forever, and she's gonna have to get, you know, an escape plan together. 'Cause if the paparazzi's almost running me down, can you imagine what they're gonna do to her? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I would like Kim to, like, live one day with... and just being, like, relaxed and free and like focus on, like, how you feel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I think you Freaky thing. And see if that actually happens. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I agree. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: YO--LO. 437 00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,774 ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look what we've got! Kourtney, the fact that your vagina shows in that dress freaks me out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not a dress, it's a top and I thought it was a dress. Okay, look. We got some potential guys and we got their phone numbers. Just to protect MJ from serial killers or any crazy Internet scams, we're gonna go through a phone screening process so we can interview these potential dates. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's see... He's a Gemini. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No Geminis. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, look, this guy puts a photo up with his grandkids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's call him first. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's his body type? A few extra pounds? &gt;&gt; NORMAN: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, is this Norman? &gt;&gt; NORMAN: This is Norman. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. I'm calling for my grandmother, MJ, on the Web site? &gt;&gt; NORMAN: Oh, mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: What kind of things do you like to do for fun? &gt;&gt; NORMAN: Um... mostly anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: It says you're from the East Coast, but you've been living in California for 45 years. &gt;&gt; NORMAN: Right. Well, I was... well, I was born in Rhode Island. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, Norman. We'll speak soon, hopefully. &gt;&gt; NORMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; NORMAN: Thanks for calling. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; WALT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, is this Walt? &gt;&gt; WALT: Yes, it is! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; WALT: Well, fine! &gt;&gt; KIM: We were calling on behalf of our grandmother, MJ. &gt;&gt; WALT: Oh! I appreciated her spunk. She has got a sense of humor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's also straight to the point when it comes to bed, too. &gt;&gt; WALT: Yeah, we could be a... we could be a dynamite couple. I'm in good shape. I-I got one of these, uh, NutriBullets you see advertised on the TV, and I load that thing up with spinach and carrots and my body is toned up. I'm in better shape than I need to be! &gt;&gt; KIM: That is... seriously, that is what I want. &gt;&gt; WALT: Well, Kimberly, thank you for listening to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you, Walt. We'll talk soon. &gt;&gt; WALT: Good night. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good night. Seriously, I think I'm in love with Walt. You guys, I did all the legwork and did the calls. I don't have the heart to meet with these guys, so you're gonna have to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I will be there. These guys seem really sweet and harmless, and we'd love to meet them and see what they're like in person before we throw them on my grandmother. &gt;&gt; KIM: I do like Sexy And he's a Libra. Oh, my God, he's only five four, you guys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's why we nixed him out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He looks really horny. &gt;&gt; KIM: He does. ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi! You look beautiful. I'm happy you have no makeup on. &gt;&gt; KIM: No makeup for you. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Your hair's still wet. &gt;&gt; KIM: My hair is still wet. I haven't even brushed it yet. (Leah laughs, speaks indistinctly) I love that, though. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yes, it does. I have never seen you with no makeup on until today. &gt;&gt; KIM: I, like, go to the gym every single day with no makeup on. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Do you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Okay, ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Khloe complained to Leah that I'm putting way too much pressure on looking perfect, which is so ridiculous. I'm not always about the glitz and the glam. Like, I can be pretty chill. &gt;&gt; LEAH: This is Kim. &gt;&gt; RACHELLE: You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. Leah suggested I come into her world in Malibu with no makeup and do this yoga class. My feet are really swollen. &gt;&gt; RACHELLE: You know what? You look awesome. You're-you're almost there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I just want her to feel good. &gt;&gt; RACHELLE: Great. Okay, great. So you're gonna place your one hand here and one hand to your baby. Long breath in. Keep that length and exhale to your baby. Allow your baby to feel wanted, desired, safe, cherished. Good. And open up your eyes, bring your hands... This is a mudra. &gt;&gt; KIM: What if my water broke? Like, right here? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I'm afraid of that happening. &gt;&gt; KIM: Me, too. &gt;&gt; RACHELLE: Um, would you like to go ahead and I'll put you into something called Delicious Pose. So this is like fort-building for kids. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. Mm... Are you relaxed? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I could fall asleep. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I am honestly so happy to see Kim so calm. And like she's really embracing what she's doing, because I really want to try to get Kim to focus more on the way that she feels and less on the way that she looks. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was amazing. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel so relaxed. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, good, I'm glad! ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are... what are those questions you wrote down? "Would you be willing to commute to San Diego? What do you like to do for fun? Who is your favorite musician?" Oh, my God... This is gonna be one hell of a dinner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My sisters and I have narrowed down the candidates to three lucky men. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; KEN: Good. I'm Ken. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KEN: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KEN: Hi, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; NORMAN: Norman. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice to meet you. We just want to meet them in person and see if any of them would be good to meet MJ. &gt;&gt; WALT: Hello, there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hi. Khloe. &gt;&gt; WALT: Hi, my pleasure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; WALT: Two of the Ks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One is at home. &gt;&gt; WALT: Kim, mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WALT: I had a nice conversation with her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You did. You talked for a very long time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim had a connection with you. You know that, right? &gt;&gt; WALT: She can call me anytime. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We brought some questions. What do you guys like to do for fun? Line dancing? &gt;&gt; KEN: I hate line dancing. Now, swing dancing, couples dancing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That sounds fun. &gt;&gt; KEN: You bet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are a swinger? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Norm, are you shy? &gt;&gt; NORM: Yeah. When you get to know me, I'm not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You make us work for it. &gt;&gt; NORM: Well... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And that's what I like about you, Norm. You don't just give it all up for free. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys have a celebrity crush? &gt;&gt; KEN: I was in a train store and Merle Haggard walked in. He was at the top of his game at that time. Very cool guy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You had a crush on him? &gt;&gt; KEN: No, I did not have a crush on him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you like Marilyn Monroe? She's pretty hot. &gt;&gt; WALT: Yeah, smoking hot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would've boned her if I was a guy. &gt;&gt; WALT: Tell me about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like your style. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you like all races? &gt;&gt; WALT: Doesn't matter to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm the same way. &gt;&gt; WALT: I always wanted to make love to somebody that didn't speak English. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Me, too. Ooh! Uh-oh! Party! &gt;&gt; WALT: All right! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think all three of them are very cute and sweet. They're all very different. This is just really hard to pick. I could see potential in each one of them. I feel like we kind of have a good vibe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This was fun. &gt;&gt; KEN: That was fun, we should do it again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you, guys. It was nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; NORMAN: Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. That was very, very interesting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, Walt should just date... &gt;&gt; KIM: My friend just had a baby. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KIM: She just had her. Her eyes look a little red. Oh, do you want to see mine? I have the cutest picture of my baby. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, you do? &gt;&gt; KIM: From inside... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Did you, like, get the 3D one? &gt;&gt; KIM: She looks so cute. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh! &gt;&gt; KIM: She looks like she has makeup on. Can you see? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: Doesn't she really look like that? &gt;&gt; LEAH: It looks like she has, like, a full set of, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone has said that. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't that funny? She's just like me. &gt;&gt; LEAH: She is. She's just like you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally, right? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Am I gonna have to work on her, too? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Well, I'm just happy that you came over. &gt;&gt; KIM: Should we go? I'll drive us. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I asked Leah if I can drive her 1976 pickup truck. I've never driven one, and it just felt fun and adventurous. How the hell do you get in here? &gt;&gt; LEAH: You got to do a running start. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is ridiculous. Oh, my God. You drive this? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah, all the time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seat belt won't fit me. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, there you go. &gt;&gt; LEAH: There you go. Yep. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Like that? Yup, there you go. Good job &gt;&gt; LEAH: Whoa! &gt;&gt; KIM: Am I good? &gt;&gt; LEAH: You hit the mailbox! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, the mailbox is gone, but you got it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Eek, a Rolls-Royce! Sorry. Miss you. I'm really afraid for my life in this car. I'm not gonna lie. It feels like I could fly out at any second. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Just think about how much makeup, clothes and handbags you could fit in the pickup back there. &gt;&gt; LEAH: The doors are 637 00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:55,334 creaking. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lately all the paparazzi and the photographers know our every move. It's really just adding on this extra pressure. &gt;&gt; LEAH: God, wow. It's crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We've been meeting these guys for MJ to, like, go on a date with. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But do you think we should tell her or just bring the lucky winner? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: MJ might kill us. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not if they give her pleasure. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why won't it open? &gt;&gt; KIM: They have to get off my sidewalk. They have to get off my sidewalk. Where's Pascal? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is security doing? My remote's not working. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, you're looking at pictures of yourself right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, look how chunky my thighs are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, you don't zoom into it. God, if you zoomed in to my , it's sobig. Myhas it's own zip code. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Trademark it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just like Puff Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, Kourtney, what are we gonna do about these grandpas? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look, these are the guys that we met for MJ. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That looks like the guy from KFC. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Walt's a talker. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Walt is a talker. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think MJ'll like this guy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who, the cowboy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, that seems up her alley. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's Ken, Ken is in his 60s. Ken is a really sweet guy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, he's a young buck. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but MJ likes younger guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is Norm. He was really sweet. He's not a talker. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: MJ might kill us. For doing this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not if they give her pleasure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! It's the big cheese. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We've been meeting these guys for MJ to, like, go on a date with. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But do you think we should tell her or just bring the lucky winner? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would tell her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, are you, um, being intimate with someone right now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What a freak. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I know who I would pick. Who would you pick? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, because I think he has a fun personality... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I like Kenny. I just feel like he could saddle her up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think I would pick Walt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like Norm just might not be it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But MJ is a powerful woman. She likes... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Weak men? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...to be in charge, and she likes... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, she's a Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's where we all 694 00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:19,010 get it from. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: My vagina's starting to swell. Just like it's plump, I like it. &gt;&gt; LISA: Look how little your stomach looks, it's so flawless. &gt;&gt; KIM: It doesn't look that big. I feel like it could get bigger. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So, you're having some cramps, huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: A little bit, I... &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: I never had as much cramps as you had a few months ago. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, no. This is different. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay, I'm gonna look at the cervix. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: And we'll have a look at the baby. According to this, the cervix is getting a little bit thinner. So, here's the baby. So, here's a couple things that are interesting. The head is down. This baby is very average size. He weighs exactly five pounds. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: There's a lot of movement. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I feel so much movement. She, like, kicks me so hard. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Well, the head is down pretty low on the pelvis. It is not good. &gt;&gt; KIM: The doctor tells me the baby's low, and this didn't seem normal. It's starting to freak me out. My pregnancy has been so tough. I don't know how much more bad news I can handle. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Well, let's just feel your tummy. That is pretty low. So, you really don't have to come down any lower before you go into labor. &gt;&gt; LISA: Really? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: We don't want you to have it for another couple of three, four weeks, but it's possible you're gonna have it before the 12th. &gt;&gt; KIM: I could be having this baby a lot sooner than I thought. Everything just all of a sudden feels really overwhelming. Not only do I still have so much to do, but I'm just worried about the health of my baby. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay, just to be safe about this, we're gonna draw a few blood tests. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: I'll get that organized. She'll come and draw your blood. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Walt is meeting us at this restaurant and MJ has no idea. &gt;&gt; MJ: Hi, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, MJ. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We signed up on this dating Web site and pretended that we were you. &gt;&gt; MJ: Listen, don't bring any &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to pee so badly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so annoying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, Walt is meeting us at this restaurant and MJ has no idea. We need to call her right now and tell her. I'll talk to her, but what the hell do I say? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just freeball it. &gt;&gt; MJ: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, MJ. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're excited to see you, and I had to tell you something. &gt;&gt; MJ: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Would you ever want to date again or have a companion or is that so not interesting to you? &gt;&gt; MJ: Are you gonna hire me a gigolo? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but you're gonna think we're insane, but we signed up on this dating Web site and pretended that we were you. &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then Khloe and I met three of the guys. &gt;&gt; MJ: You met them? Listen, don't bring any of them with you today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're gonna have lunch with you, but then... at the very end, we wanted to see if you would just say hi to one of them. &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, dear. You shouldn't have done that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This guy is a talker. &gt;&gt; MJ: You're not doing this. Are you really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, we're really having lunch with you by ourselves, but then we... &gt;&gt; MJ: That's what I wanted. I just want to see my baby girls. I will see you when I see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just feel really bad. I don't know why we did this. Ay, caramba! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wait a minute. Is school out? There's not one car in the parking lot. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it's summertime. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna have to start sitting up when I sleep 'cause I have such heartburn. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I get up and pee twice a night. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: And that kills me. I need to take a five minute nap on the way back. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's just you're eight months pregnant. &gt;&gt; KIM: It could literally happen any moment, that's why I get anxiety. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, I am so excited for lunch. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Watch out, Kim. They're all here. Just smile. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Hey, hey, hey! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Laugh, laugh, laugh. Just laugh. &gt;&gt; KIM: They have to get off my sidewalk. &gt;&gt; PAPARRAZO: Look this way! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why won't it open? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just push it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I am. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZI: Kim! Kim! Kim! Over here! Kim, look over here! Come on. Give me a photo or we'll make your life miserable. &gt;&gt; KIM: They have to get off my sidewalk. Where's Pascal? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I don't know. My God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tell them... Tell them someone has to go inside and get the thing. What is security doing? My remote's not working. They're not allowed on my sidewalk. That is my property. Oh! This morning, I couldn't even leave my house. They were, like, surrounding my car. What if I was in labor? My whole pregnancy I have been in the line of fire. For the most part, I deal with it because it's a part of the business. But now that I'm pregnant, I just don't need to go through it, you know, willingly. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's like an army. &gt;&gt; MJ: Are you planning something against me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, never against you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are we gonna do? MJ does not have any desire to meet this guy. &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, my God, is he coming? &gt;&gt; MJ: Hello! How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look pretty. &gt;&gt; MJ: I've been waiting for you all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sorry. What are we gonna do? MJ does not have any desire to meet this guy. I mean, we got it in her ears, but I think that she thought we were joking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's, like, ten minutes away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MJ: He what? Are you planning something against me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, never against you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We wouldn't do that. &gt;&gt; MJ: Bible? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have to tell you about Walt. &gt;&gt; MJ: My grandfather's name. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He lives in San Diego. &gt;&gt; MJ: How do you know he's not an axe murderer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's why we screened him for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what we said to him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He has four kids. &gt;&gt; MJ: Where'd he go to school? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, we didn't ask that question. But I will say he's a truck driver. &gt;&gt; MJ: Not my cup of tea, girl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's so nice though. &gt;&gt; MJ: So is my gardener. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and I are the worst matchmakers ever. Like, we are not selling any of Walt's, like, good qualities. We really are so dumb. Your love could be right around the corner. &gt;&gt; MJ: No, thank you. I only want a Harry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; MJ: And I have so many friends and everything. It really does take up a lot of time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you gonna tell her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, he's really ten minutes away. &gt;&gt; MJ: I'm not interested. Oh, my God. Never, never do that again. Okay, so I need to say good-bye to you girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but just wait... &gt;&gt; MJ: No, I-I don't like to hurt people's feelings. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you're gonna make us hurt his feelings? &gt;&gt; MJ: Mm-hmm, you started it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: MJ is so sassy. And I love to know that she's, like, that content without my Papa and I think it's important for me to see that. And I just feel so bad that we got Walt's hopes up and now we have to say it's not going down, brother town. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now I'm antsy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, oh, my God, is he coming? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Walt. &gt;&gt; WALT: Hey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? 852 00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:42,446 You get the head of the table. So, we have some bad news. We sat here with our grandma, trying to convince her to... &gt;&gt; WALT: She's in La Jolla, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But she's like, "I just am not ready to date anyone." &gt;&gt; WALT: I'm not ready to date anyone either. &gt;&gt; WALT: I respect that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's just a creature of habit. &gt;&gt; WALT: Yeah, they get that way, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't feel right about breaking Walt's heart. I don't think I'm gonna go on dating Web sites anymore. It's just not right to do to anybody. Kim loves talking to you. She's jealous she's not hear today. &gt;&gt; WALT: You know, Kim is a gift. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim might be calling you soon. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Doesn't that look like something ate through that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Carla came here the other day, and Carla is now moving to Dubai. It's just sad that, like, two years ago, it was, like, our New York crew, now, like, our lives are just so different. We're, like, grown up. It makes me really, like, nostalgic. I mean, this is so sad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so sad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Jonathan and I were just driving and the paparazzi yelled at me and said, "The fact that you're blocking our shots, "you just made your life a little bit more dangerous." This has to... be a better system. The laws in Europe are so different. Paparazzi can only shoot you if you're on the street. And they have to keep distance. They aren't even allowed to publish pictures of minors. They just do not care. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are they gonna be, like, running around the hospital. Or letting you even enter? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. After my last incident with the paparazzi, I'm realizing it's not safe. I need to come up with a plan. Do you know that if we didn't 891 00:40:34,157 --> 00:40:36,426 have security at the hospital, anyone can come up? Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS &gt;&gt; KIM: The paparazzi yelled at me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are they gonna be, like, running around the hospital? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. Do you know that if we didn't have security at the hospital, anyone can come up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Into the room? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. It's just crazy, so we just need, like, a really legit plan. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think you need to have the plan with your security team, 'cause that's what I did. Getting you in is one thing. But then getting you out, that's gonna be the hard part. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, getting in is gonna be... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Harder? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I think that a good option is to go to a hotel. Just somewhere where there's underground parking. Or I... no, I think the really good idea if I go to your house and then take a different car out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so relieved that Kim has finally agreed to put a plan together for her labor. This paparazzi thing has gotten so out of control that this is the safest way. And I think she's finally realizing she doesn't want to put her self in danger or her baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, the key is just to rent maybe a car. Like a random car. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What if you're not at home? What if you're out and about? In front of the paps, like, the... your water breaks. &gt;&gt; KIM: If my water breaks, that's so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You could have a mad gush. &gt;&gt; KIM: And what if I tripped on it and slipped in the water? And they got, like the craziest pics? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Slip and slide. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Up and down Rodeo 924 00:42:08,618 --> 00:42:11,521 Drive. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Look at this little flower petal. Hello. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Look at you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: How is every...? &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's been a long time. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I know, it's been a minute. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm back here now for a little bit. &gt;&gt; LEAH: How is she? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: How is she? She's, uh, she's kind of laid out. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You got, you got company. &gt;&gt; LEAH: How are you feeling? &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel tired. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, you look so beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna wake up for you. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Good. Love that. I'm so happy to see you're relaxing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, right? Hair and makeup came over today and I was like, "I love you guys, but I don't need glam." I think I was a little too ambitious when I wanted the full glam squad waiting for, like, the call. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I'm happy to hear that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I always envisioned that I would have this easy time just being pregnant. Only my belly would get big. It has just been so not that way for me. But, you know, sometimes you just have to take life for what it is and enjoy the ride. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Well, I'm glad you're resting.
