- ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look who just rolled in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Brody! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brode, what's happening? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Gettin' some food. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, we have pizza over there, we got salads over there... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I like this, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, Brode. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where did your ass go? &gt;&gt; BRODY: First off, I have no belt for these, okay? I was rushing out the door to make it here, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...they're all the way down. &gt;&gt; BRODY: 'Cause I have no belt. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you got no ass... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's 'cause you're used to living in a Kardashian house! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, that dog farted so badly or it... or he really Do you smell it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, I think he did fart. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you smell it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, he didn't... he didn't... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's just a doggy fart. It'll go away in a minute. I've smelled yours, and they're pretty bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna move to the other side. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The dog definitely farted. Unless that's Kim. It's either Kim or the... &gt;&gt; KIM: Smell my butt! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't! No! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This house is gettin' weird. ♫ &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO 1: Kim! &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO 2: Kim, this way, please. &gt;&gt; KIM: A lot has gone on since Miami. I am very pregnant. Unfortunately I'm still going through a divorce, and I still haven't found a new house to move into, so I'm just a little bit overwhelmed. But I can handle it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't even look at your boobs doing that. Seriously, I'm, like, petrified. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have 30 more seconds, okay? &gt;&gt; MATT LAUER: Ladies... Oh, it's cold out. How you feeling? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is nice, Matt. &gt;&gt; MATT: Oh, touch it some more. Wait a second. Wait, feel this side. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and I are in New York for an appearance on The Today Show. &gt;&gt; SAVANNAH GUTHRIE: ...Kim and Kourtney Kardashian. So, Kim, anything new? &gt;&gt; KIM:Nothing new. Nothing too exciting. &gt;&gt; SAVANNAH: We want to congratulate you on your pregnancy news. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SAVANNAH: I know Kourtney's willing to let you practice babysitting, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you know what she said to me on the way over here? She said that one sister should babysit all the kids and, you know, whichever sister's babysitting should just breastfeed all the kids that are there, and so... And I was like, "Uh..." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I said that's what they did back in the day. I didn't say, "Let's try this." And she said, "Does that not freak you out?" And I said, "No, it doesn't." &gt;&gt; SAVANNAH: Well, it's great to see both of you. We're really happy for you. Congratulations, and we'll see you both soon, we hope. ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Chucky-babe, whoa! We gonna get that thing runnin'? &gt;&gt; CHUCK: Yeah, I brought it over for you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love that. &gt;&gt; CHUCK: Something for you to play with. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. How are you? I'm Kris. Hi, how are you? Are you guys Armenian? &gt;&gt; ROMAN: Yes, we are. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Full-blooded, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: These are your people. I know that sometimes I can drive everyone around me crazy because I treat my house like no one's supposed to touch anything, and I'm trying to get better. So I've encouraged Bruce to invite some of his buddies over from his helicopter circle. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're doing family style tonight, guys. Get your salad, pass it down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys have fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye, Khloe! Love you! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is geometry, baby. &gt;&gt; CHUCK: Look at that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's all built on the aluminum plate. 700 centimeter blade and then they make a 500. &gt;&gt; CHUCK: Yeah, really. It's your turn. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, I'm just really tired. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I'm gonna go to bed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, before you go in there, Roman is a real estate agent, and I wanted to show him... Can I show him the upstairs? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can do whatever you want. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, we're doing it right now. Come on, all right, hurry up. Come on, Roman. I want to show you as a real estate agent. Come on... Roman. Anyway, we redid this room. That's my little closet there. &gt;&gt; ROMAN: Oh, very nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't. Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But... this, we totally redid. This was, like, a closet here and the bathroom, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? Really. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, this is the new updated. And then do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kourt, that was our dance. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott, check this out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who's that? &gt;&gt; ROB: My girl. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's the girl from the Runyon Canyon? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, this is my other girl, from Vegas. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's pretty. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, she's amazing. She's awesome. The girl's ass was really tight. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You've thrown in the backdoor before, right? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, with two different girls. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did you have to lube up or... &gt;&gt; ROB: No, it was smooth. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're a big backdoor fan, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew, you guys. What is it with grown men and always wanting to put things where they don't belong? I will never be backdoor Betty. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't think Khloe's backdooring it on a daily? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me, why do you think about that with me? That's so inappropriate. &gt;&gt; ROB: 100% y'all are backdooring it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, how do you know? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He knows what's going in there and what's not going in there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, be qu... &gt;&gt; ROB: Lamar tells me everything. He says he can at least do it three times a month. That's solid. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's super solid. Khloe and Lamar are definitely doing some super weird things that I don't even know if they're legal, but they're probably fun, and I'd be into doing them, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, I need to go. &gt;&gt; ROB: I need to go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So do I, baby. I'm dying here. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm about to go play ball. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm about to play with my balls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, bye, Khloe. I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you, guys. Thanks. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you believe your brother? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did you not hear him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I can't listen to these... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's been entering through every different angle you could approach in a human being. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like we need to experiment a little bit more. A little backdoor action? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow and ew. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're closing off certain doors. 138 00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,248 Your doors should all be open. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Seriously? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's your mission: Can he blow out the candle? We can just have you over here to just blow out all the candles over here. &gt;&gt; MAN: Very nice! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at that. &gt;&gt; MEN: Whoa! &gt;&gt; CHUCK: Okay, whose fault is that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall and Kylie and their group of teenage friends are a bazillion times more respectful than Bruce is. It's mind-boggling. &gt;&gt; CHUCK: Bruce, where's your bathroom at? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right there, on the other side of that wall. &gt;&gt; CHUCK: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right in there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: Carbons. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's the thing. That bathroom has a toilet, and nobody can figure out how to flush it. So Kris put a little sign up on the counter, "Text Bruce." Did you find it? Did you read the little sign? &gt;&gt; CHUCK: That's embarrassing! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Should I go west or east? &gt;&gt; KIM: Go right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This traffic is crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stress, stress, stress all the way around the board. Isn't court, like, so stressful? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney is stressful? &gt;&gt; KIM: Court. No, like, going to court. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, court. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, attorneys and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so stressful. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, the fact that he wants to push back my deposition. This is, like, the fourth time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? Is this even, like, allowed for them to push it back so many times? Wouldn't the judge get frustrated and say, "Sorry." &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris wants to be there in my deposition. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It just makes no sense. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I have so much going on. You know, all of the work commitments that I do, and you know, this, like, stressful divorce, and I'm trying to now figure out where my next house is. It's, like, the most stressful thing of life to not know where you're living in three months. There's just no privacy at Kanye's house. I sold my house. So many things that you didn't really plan on, but for now, I'm doing the best that I can and all I know. I'm just, like, exhausted emotionally. It's just so frustrating. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so frustrating. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know what to do. Everything stresses me out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, hello! Damn! Look at the little butt on you in those leather shorts. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pumpkin pumping. I feel like you're wearing these to try to promote what I've been asking for. I can already tell Kourtney is starting to be a little less on the fence with this whole thing. And if you ask me, if I keep knocking, that door's gonna open. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Listen wisely. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you got, a salad? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the brown eye that you speak of. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ew! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is disgusting what you're doing. This is what you're trying to do to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you want to involve foods... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now are you hungry? 'Cause I am. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Now... I have a different scenario. Let me show you something. Pow! Okay? I'm lubed. This is your butt, of course. And then... "What's happening? Oh, God, that's starting to feel good," you're saying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, now... Hello? Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: First of all, this is so disgusting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you getting so angry about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You really need to get off this backdoor bandwagon. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not trying to get off it. I'm trying to get in it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew. I just ate a donut with a crumb of a carrot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah, eat that little dirty donut, you bad girl. We're gonna get there, babe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, are you done with your massage? 'Cause dinner's on the table. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Seriously? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Gabanna. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Shh-shh, shh. Is she sleeping? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Gabanna? Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm trying to get a massage, and the dog is, like, licking my ear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, could you take the dog in the other room? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just a lot of snorting noises when it's not necessary. I'm trying to relax. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Gabanna, we're not wanted in here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, really? I have been married to you for 22-and-a-half years. You know exactly the buttons to push, and it's not nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The world doesn't stop when Kris gets a massage. The house continues to function. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is where I go for privacy and peace and to be with my family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have no privacy and no peace, baby. I got no space whatsoever. I got a little corner in the garage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can go get a man cave. You and your Ping-Pong table and your dog can go have a great time. Your helicopter friends, you can all go find a little getaway that you can go relax at. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll look for a place. Everybody needs a little space. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't make me laugh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, it'll be kind of good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott will not drop it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you try it on him? And if it doesn't hurt him, maybe it won't hurt you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ...but are you and Mom, like, okay? Are you moving out? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everything's fine. We're just getting a little more space. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad is trying to convince me this is a good 249 00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:22,990 thing, but I don't believe that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Listen to that. That's your baby's heartbeat. That was crazy, Kim. &gt;&gt; DR. CRANE: This is the face. See the left eyeball right right there? I didn't give you any pictures today. You want a few? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, that's okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How could you now want a picture of what you just saw? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have one of... &gt;&gt; CRANE: All right, we're gonna see you back here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll come next week. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're more excited than she is. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but I just, there's a lot going on in my life right now. I think there was one other thing I was gonna say. Why would a normal human want to eat their own placenta? Don't you think it makes you younger? &gt;&gt; CRANE: Some people believe in that. But there is whole cookbooks on placentas, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yuck. I don't think we're gonna be eating the fountain of youth, if you know what I mean. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really want to do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You have your seatbelts on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Easy lane changes. You did this the other day. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Accelerate, accelerate. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, Kylie, get over! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall! You two are the worst people to drive with. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I thought to invite Kendall and Kylie on this little house-hunting expedition because at first I thought, "Getting my own place, that's absolutely crazy." You know, no way that's gonna work. But, now, thinking about it, you know, it might not be a bad idea. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are we going to Venice right now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The Marina. It's right next to Venice. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So you want to live down here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, no. I don't know. We'll take a look at it. Who knows? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, are you moving out? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm not moving out. Sometimes space is a good thing. Everything's fine. We're just getting a little more space. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So, it's, like, a beach house? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kind of a like a beach house, yeah. It's a getaway house. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But are you and Mom, like, okay with it...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, we're doing fine. Nothing's happening. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My dad is trying to convince me that this is a healthy thing and a good thing, but I don't think I really believe that. &gt;&gt; BARRY LIVINGSTON: Hello. How are you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hello. &gt;&gt; LIVINGSTON: Take a look upstairs. This is the master bedroom upstairs. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My dad only has a corner of our house, basically, in the garage, so I feel like it would be a good idea if he had his own space. And if it's on the beach, then I could just go there all the time and hang out. &gt;&gt; LIVINGSTON: It's really like the art house. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, it's cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, thank you, guys. &gt;&gt; LIVINGSTON: Bye, honey, nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kimberly is sending me pictures of herself in high heels. And didn't we just tell her to not put on high heels? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I'm the one who told her to get those. Scott just texted me, "Knock-knock. Who's there? It's my penis knocking on your backdoor." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He will not drop it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you try it on him, and if it doesn't hurt him, maybe it won't hurt you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's totally such a good idea. Is that what you do at home? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I feel like you should just be, like, "Oh, you want to bother me so much about it? Let's see. Are you willing to do it?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Of course, Scott would never consider the other way around, so I can definitely have a little fun with this. We are better than yesterday. 325 00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,063 Let me tell you that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Still searching for the right house, but I decided this time to bring my son Brandon and his wife Leah and Robert. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: But why are you looking at places in the first place? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sometimes around the house, it's just kind of a little crazy. We need, like, another place. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I feel like that means something. It's not just, like, expanding your spaces... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But after, like, 23 years? It's just a second house. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: All right, I'm on board. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A little space, baby. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nothing wrong with space. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Beautiful. &gt;&gt; ROB: This house is beautiful. I might have to... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You ready to move in? &gt;&gt; ROB: I might have to just get it instead of you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nice view. I grew up in Malibu. You know, I lived there for almost 20 years. My kids Brandon and Leah and Brody live close to there. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, you know, Malibu's the place. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Aren't you gonna get lonely here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe lonely would be good. 350 00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:49,510 &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. What's up with you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've been thinking, my dear. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah? Oh, about my proposition? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, it's a scary thought. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whatever it is to make you feel better, I am down. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you tried it, then I would feel much better. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you talking about exactly? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You got to let me do it to you first. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: With what?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll get a dildo... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What?! Wha...?! Are you insane?! This isn't a two-way street! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ah! &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye and I finally bought a house together. Pillars will be out, different chandeliers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you gonna babyproof all this? Like, I don't think you get it. You don't fix problems by putting separation between you guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Until you've been 371 00:17:57,668 --> 00:18:01,808 married for 23 years, then don't judge our relationship. you feel better, I am down. tried it, then I would feel much better. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you talking about, exactly? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You gotta let me do it to you first. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: With what?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll get a dildo. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What... what? Wh... are you insane? This isn't a two-way street. Ah... Oh, don't, uh, You want to say that you've been with a guy that's taken a big old dildo in his butt-oon? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Well, we would... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was the... that was the... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I won't stick it... I'll go like this, nice and slow. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was the sound of you breaking my ass virginity? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll do it nice and slow and then... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ew! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...pop it right on in. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I need to go first? That's not right. What the, man? This is a one, single door, and I'm not knocking from the other side. The fact that you would even want to do that to me is so sick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: After that, I'm all yours. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is very tricky and weird. I'm gonna call this bluff, 398 00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:10,500 though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a date. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honey, I'm home. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're taking off the balcony. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's gonna be a beige color with, like, green ivy going up it. Kanye and I finally bought a house together, and we are pretty much tearing down this house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So are your stairs and everything going to be not wood? &gt;&gt; KIM: Changing everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's crazy. This is a lot of work that you're going to take on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, what can you do? You know? Back wall, live greenery. The whole wall. But none of that ceiling, none of the marble... We're building a wall that's 25 feet high, and then we're gonna move the pool... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Move the pool? Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not livable now. Okay, here, I'll show you the rest. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's definitely not livable. Are you going to baby-proof all this? &gt;&gt; KIM: The baby won't walk for, like, two years, almost. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The baby does walk within a year. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, they don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't really know what Kim is thinking. Even at a few months old, you're gonna need to baby-proof, no matter what. They're still grabbing. You have to do so much work. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If your house isn't done, where are you going to, like, live and set up and... &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom's. Kendall and Kylie can be nannies. It'll be like, easy living. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know it's an infant baby. You're not gonna want to leave the infant baby with Kendall and Kylie. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just saying, if I have to run to the bathroom. I'm gonna stay there and not even leave. I already know that this house isn't gonna be ready by the time the baby gets here, so the last thing I need is for Khloe to be adding on this extra pressure by re-confirming to me that this house won't be ready in time, and just stressing me out even more. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just think you're in for, like, a major wake-up call. Like, I don't think you get it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing in Bruce's closet? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm, um... Do you think this looks like it would fit him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I'll pack this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But why are you packing Bruce's stuff? I've never seen you pack for him a day since I've been born. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am packing for him because he rented a little place in Malibu. As, like, a getaway. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is he getting his own place? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's mutual. We need a break. It actually is a very... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would he want to go somewhere when he lives here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So we don't kill each other. He leased it for six months. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you think once you put too much space in between, like, that's just where you get comfortable, and then it's only more and more space is gonna, like... develop? Is this, like, leading to him moving out, and then getting a divorce? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We do not want to get a divorce. We discussed this. We want to... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've discussed getting a divorce? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. We've said we don't want to get a divorce. By developing some sort of extended friendship that we're not killing each other living... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Extended friendship"? This-- it's not a pen pal. Does Bruce want this, or are you making him do this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's his idea, too. He's so excited. And... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is Bruce here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's downstairs. He knows I'm packing for him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is not going well. He's now gonna meet new people, and he's living away. Bruce? Are you moving out willingly? Or because Mom's making you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not moving out, first of all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think it's a smart idea for him to move out? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not moving out. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I honestly don't know. I'm still trying to figure it all out, myself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I-I'm not moving out... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, sorry, but I think it's weird. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...I'm just, we get a second house. And if she's driving me crazy, I can go out there, for a day, and then come back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't... isn't that what golf is for, and your helicopters? The pitter-patter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, don't you think this is, like, kind of... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...the beginning stages of you guys constantly staying away from each other? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't even know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't fix problems by putting, like, all this separation between you guys. One day, you guys are just never gonna come back to the... like, the same house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's the year 2013, by the way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't... I like the more old-fashioned... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And this is what happens in... Really? Well, we're not old-fashioned anymore, and until you've been married for 23 years, then don't judge our relationship. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I am all for having a man room. But, like, this is like a recipe for disaster. I hope, after 23 years, I'm not as miserable as you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah. This is just the most bizarre thing that I've probably ever done in my life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is this some kind of joke? Get out of here, you little freak! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Stop it! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm probably going to have this baby being married to someone else. I'm scared. That's not the way I ever wanted to have a baby. paté maison. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: That is pretty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. So here's that peach cobbler again. I love to cook for my family. Always have. Oh! Sweet potato soufflé. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: Oh, good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love my sweet potato soufflé. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: Oh, good, we found it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've decided to go through all my recipes and take that walk down memory lane, and to practice cooking. To sit here and do this, peacefully, without Bruce... is therapeutic. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: Where is he? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's got, like, a "man cave" in Malibu. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: So this isn't, like, a separation... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. It's not a sad thing. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: It's not? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! &gt;&gt; RHONDA: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's a wonderful guy. 522 00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:38,433 But just the quiet in the house... it's healthier. &gt;&gt; LEAH: All right. We're playing to five right now. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To five? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Ping, Pong, rally's on. Oh... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Ooh! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, yes. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Ooh, ooh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That was embarrassing. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I like it over here. It's got a good vibe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it's got the ocean in the background. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Ping-Pong in the living room. Without getting yelled at. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. This is actually working out quite nicely. I can put the Ping-Pong table right in the living room, and nobody's saying anything. Ooh... &gt;&gt; LEAH: So are you loving it, Bruce? Are you loving living alone? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Are you missing Kris at all? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. 541 00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:25,753 I'm doing just fine. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is so hot. Oh, yeah. I mean, this is just the most bizarre thing that I've probably ever done in my life, and Scott is going to be absolutely terrified, and hopefully never 548 00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:59,013 bother me about this backdoor business ever again. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is that little thing? What the hell are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tonight's the night. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Tonight's the night what? That you become a man? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What, is this some kind of joke? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get out of here, you little freak! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Stop it! Are you nuts? Ew! Get that away! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just having way too much fun with this. Scott is so freaked out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you j... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just dancing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How do you expect me to ever sleep with you again? I'm living with a real freak. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I got the room nice and romantic. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For wh... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I can... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you gonna do with this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Break you open. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you insane? I've seen Kourtney do some pretty weird things in my day, but walking around with a little schmeckel in front of her is making me think that I may have to become celibate after this. Oh, my God. This is so disgusting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, and you're the one who started it. So I'll leave you alone, if you leave me alone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm starting to kind of understand your side of this now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, exactly. The exact same way you feel about this is exactly how I feel about this. I never want to hear about it again. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I will never even think about it again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. I'm definitely gonna hold on to this little toy because if Scott ever forgets, I'm whipping that thing out and then I'll shove it right in there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Aye, aye, aye. 584 00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:23,969 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aye, aye, aye is right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mmm, this pasta is so good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim come on. Follow me. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to show you what I did. I know you might be spending a lot more time here, so I'm gonna do this whole room like a nursery. One of the most amazing things about pregnancy is embracing this magical time. I still remember it like it was yesterday, and it goes by so quickly. Won't this be cute? Look at this little crib. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And look at the stroller I just got for you. So I'm gonna take everything out; they're gonna take these doors off. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am just, like, not ready for this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, you're having a baby, so we all have to get prepared. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everybody's excited for you. Naturally, Kim has to be really upset that she's moving and her divorce isn't final, and the fact that she can't enjoy being pregnant breaks my heart. We get to pick what color we want to do the walls. Won't this be fun? And then do an entire wall of bookshelves with a big TV on that wall. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, not in the mood for this right now. Once I start showing, maybe I'll get excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're having a baby with somebody that you love very much. I just want you to enjoy this. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just... I don't want to talk about it. I'm probably gonna have this baby being married to someone else. I'm scared. That's not the way I ever wanted to have a baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. I mean, I definitely didn't mean to overwhelm you. It is all a little tossed up right now. There's a lot of uncertainties, but it was definitely the most wonderful time of my life, and I want you to have the same experience. And I'm getting worried. I've listened to you for weeks 622 00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,405 now, and it's breaking my heart. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really hate it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Knock, knock. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's up with the mess? You have salsa and chips everywhere. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I came here to get away from all of that. I don't want them coming here and invading my space now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Grab your stuff, and I'll meet you back at the house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What if I don't want to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's really scared, and she hides it pretty damn good of how upset she actually is. She needs us right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm getting worried. I've listened to you for weeks now, say that you don't enjoy being pregnant, and it's breaking my heart. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really hate it, though. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want you to love everything going on around you, and I think we're so excited for you that we just want to shower you with love. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe in a little bit. Maybe when I figure it all out, I'll have fun with it, but right now... &gt;&gt; KRIS: There are so many people in this world that would give everything that they have to be able to get pregnant. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel very blessed, but I'm dealing with so many other things just... Everyone just needs to, like, ease back a little bit until I'm ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I get it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just so stressed. I'll literally cry if I see everyone and have to explain it, so I'm gonna go. Sorry for leaving. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, honey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, where's Kim? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She feels bad, but she had to go because she was really upset. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She just said that she's really scared-- she said, "Mom, I'm overwhelmed." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who wouldn't be scared to have a baby? Like, isn't everyone scared? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think she's really trying to put on a brave face. She feels like she's letting all of us down because we're more excited than she is. So I think that we just have to let her know that we're gonna be with her every step of the way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do feel really bad for Kim. Obviously, she loves that she's pregnant with Kanye's baby, but I know that she wishes it happened at a different time. She wishes that she wasn't still married to somebody else. More than ever, she needs our support, and as a family, we'll always get through everything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She hides it pretty damn good of how upset she actually is. She needs us right now, so... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think an e-mail will be sufficient. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not an e-mail. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We'll be there with open arms, 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And then they'll be inside with open vaginas. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Well, on that note... The together, and he makes these really annoying comments throughout the whole show that drive me crazy. Well, now I have the opportunity to watch the show by myself, which should be heaven, but somehow, I find myself missing 680 00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:24,350 those really annoying Bruce Jenner comments. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Those guys are so scary. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Kylie, watch the road. I'm driving with a 15-year-old. Okay, thanks, Steven. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, Kendall and I were talking. Um, space is good sometimes. I think getting your own place was a little too overboard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it depends on how you look at it. Kendall and Kylie, they're young, they're impressionable, they're also growing up. So it's really important for me to be honest and upfront. He can do his thing, and he doesn't have to feel like I'm hollering at him all the time. And it gives me time to kind of get a restart, you know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Even though you probably don't want to admit it, you miss him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Even though I don't want to admit it, I miss him. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce has been spending so much more time at the getaway house lately, and this situation of us living in two separate places isn't supposed to be permanent. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, we got to go get your man. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Let's bring him back in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are a grown-up now. Do you realize that? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're a pretty cool, mature little chick. 705 00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:43,295 I just want to tell you that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks, dude. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kind of in the plants. It's all right, though. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're good. Okay. Let's go take a look. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Knock, knock. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You look so cute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. Look who's here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. Nice view. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you think? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have a Jacuzzi? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you been in the Jacuzzi? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not yet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So cute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got, uh, really good decorations. That is a piece of artwork right there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's up with the mess? You have salsa and chips everywhere. Look at the cookies. They're gonna get stale. And you have a Frisbee in your kitchen? Bruce, who leaves a mess like this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is my space. I don't need her telling me what to do at all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't sleep on this mattress. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why can't I? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna have a bad back in about five minutes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If I go back to the house, I'll expect that. I came here to get away from all of that. I don't want them coming here and invading my space now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Grab your stuff, and I'll meet you back at the house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What if I don't want to? &gt;&gt; CRANE: So we're gonna hopefully see the sex today, huh? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's see the sex of this baby. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Here's the head. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at that. &gt;&gt; CRANE: We're gonna have to look around for the sex. There you go. That's it; take a look. 738 00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:08,583 &gt;&gt; KIM: What's the percentage? &gt;&gt; CRANE: 99 plus. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The closet here is bigger than the closet I got at our house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You'll have a really great home-cooked meal tonight. You can sleep on a really great mattress. So why don't you grab your stuff, and I'll meet you back at the house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What if I don't want to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You secretly want to come home and have pizza. So come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. It's a nice view, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go home and have dinner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So you miss me already, huh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe I miss you a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But you're getting a little carried away. Consider this your office. You should come here, like, 9:00 to 5:00, and you come home and have dinner and sleep on a proper mattress. Okay? All right, come on, Kylie, let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sounds like you miss me, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See you at home, Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye! Love you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Surprise, surprise. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you guys doing here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aren't you excited to see us? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I told them if one of you were pregnant, you're all kind of pregnant. We're all is this together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's see the sex of this baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. We gonna do this, people. &gt;&gt; KIM: Welcome to my home away from home, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Wow, you got the whole group here, don't you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I'm... &gt;&gt; CRANE: How are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good to see you. Mwah. &gt;&gt; CRANE: How you doing? Okay? You feeling all right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I feel good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How many months along is she, or weeks? &gt;&gt; CRANE: Just shy of 20 weeks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I'm further along then I thought. &gt;&gt; CRANE: So you're about 19 weeks plus. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you're halfway there, Kim. &gt;&gt; CRANE: So we're gonna hopefully see the sex today, huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: I hope so. &gt;&gt; CRANE: We want to get to 100%, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; CRANE: So we're gonna hopefully see the sex today, huh? We want to get to 100%, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Once I knew the sex is when I got so excited. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Let's have you lay back. Let's turn down the lights so we can see a little better. Ooh, look at that. There's a hand. So, this is the femur bone, see? The thigh bone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at that. Look at the little ankle. Oh, Kim, look. &gt;&gt; CRANE: All right, we're gonna have to look around for the sex. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you see a little pee-pee? &gt;&gt; CRANE: I don't see any pee-pees. &gt;&gt; KIM: It would definitely take after his father, so you would see it. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Here's, look at the genital region again. I'm thinking it's a girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How exciting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Girl? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Take a look. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's the percentage? &gt;&gt; CRANE: 99 plus. &gt;&gt; KIM: 99 plus, so I can tell people it's a girl. I'm so excited we're having a girl. Who doesn't want a girl? Like, they are the best, and I know that's really what Kanye has always wanted. He wanted a little girl. &gt;&gt; CRANE: I'd say your baby looks terrific today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kokes, it's a girl. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a girl. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Congrats, Kimmy. We love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you look nice. Are you going out? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I just got dressed up because you're here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 'Cause I'm here? No way. Kris is dressed up for me? I don't know what's happened to her, but it's cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're eating in the dining room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The dining room? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you go sit down. Just the way he likes it. Here you go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, this is working out. The man of the house here. I love this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is exactly what we had the first night that we went on that date at the Ivy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow. Remember when we first met and I threw my arms around you and I said what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: "At last, in the arms of a real woman." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got you right there, didn't it? Just melted right there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was it. You got me right there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That was the beginning. We've worked hard. We've been smart. We can keep this going. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For may be another 24 years. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I will always love Bruce Jenner, and I think that what makes us work is the fact that we have a really good sense of humor. I think a lot of other people might read us the wrong way, and go, "Oh, my God, they're arguing," but it's what makes our marriage work. We can be funny and tease each other and be light, and at the end of the day, we know what each other needs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's the old smile that used to just do it when I first met you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aren't you excited? Your first shopping experience? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so excited that Kim called me to go baby shopping with her. Now that she knows what she's having, she's really starting to get into it and excited and start planning. &gt;&gt; KIM: I find myself starting to waddle a bit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I thought you always waddled. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I did. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look, this is the high chair that I have. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a cute toy. I feel like my kid's gonna need musical things. Penelope, Mason and the baby should really start a band. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They should. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have to get these Yolo signs. What kind of child will I have? A very tutu-y, like, princess? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think so, but I think, like, a black tutu with, like, a gold chain. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh, I need this baby bottle. Oh, my gosh, if we play tennis, look at how cute. I'm so excited we're having a girl. I just can't wait to see what she's gonna talk like, what she's gonna look like. I am so excited about the joy that she's gonna bring into our lives. It'll just be such a fun experience. Thank you. 863 00:41:24,002 --> 00:41:26,874 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you so much. Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I finally feel like I'm at a really good place, being pregnant. Even though it's still so overwhelming and there's a lot I need to learn, I'm just embracing it now. I'm really excited, being able to enjoy such a fun, magical process. This is your daddy singing. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's gonna be a huge change in dynamics here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, when you do baby stuff, you guys don't talk to me. You guys, like, really don't listen to me. Let's do something to Kim. We could TP her house. Mom, hurry! Let's go, let's go. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, vandalizing my house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you kidding me? This car thinks it's going. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kendall has unlimited potential as a legitimate supermodel. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I need a break from Kendall. I will hit you in the throat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are just at that age, you want to find your own identity. &gt;&gt; ROB: I need to lose 40 pounds. How am I gonna know if my are going away? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. Come on, Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Welcome to Greece, everybody! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so pretty here. Look at your tummy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: So scared. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, it's floating! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: This trip is the best thing that ever happened to us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bon voyage. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It made me happy to come here, and I'm not a sentimental guy, so don't my image up. You never realize how lucky you are. You just take it for granted. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is definitely changing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One day, I'm gonna have kids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would carry the baby for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is disgusting. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you do in vitro... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been through it all; I don't want to play God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, you could totally just adopt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: That would be so perfect for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You never know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brody's mad 'cause I wasn't around that much. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Both of them have a lot of pain. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Some things last a lifetime. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob got in this altercation. They're pressing charges? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You look like someone who's ready to go to jail. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What are you gonna do when that baby's coming? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wake up Kanye. He's gonna be on diaper duty. There's a lot going on in my life right now. It gives me, like, pains in my stomach. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're not supposed to be stressed. It's bad for your body and for the baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want me to meet you at the hospital? I'm on my way. &gt;&gt; CRANE: The blood count, that's pretty serious. 920 00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:44,432 &gt;&gt; KIM: It hurts so bad.
