- &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Bernard. Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, you're a unicorn. You're a real unicorn. You're getting bigger. Pretty soon, I can't hold you. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's the saddest feeling when you can't hold them anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you take naps? &gt;&gt; KIM: I haven't yet, but I'm really in the mood for one right about now. Oh, my gosh, Khlo, the baby's moving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hi, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just did a huge kick. Like, right there. You can, like, actually see my stomach, like, move. Okay, just watch. Did you see that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I saw that over there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's such a cool feeling when you feel for the first time movement or, like, the baby kicking, and it gets me, you know, excited that, you know, it's, like, the time is coming, like, so much faster than I think. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what I never want to see? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where, like, the foot, like, is bulging out. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like an alien in your stomach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. What? Ew, don't do that. Well, I just don't want to see that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, look what I found. Remember when we used to use these bad boys? Do you remember this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why are you putting it by your thing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: One cuff on my penis, and then one cuff onto your &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You like that? Say "ow" again. It makes me horny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You ever use those back in the day with old Kris Jenner, the cuffs? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Never the cuffs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I Instagramed these. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why do you do that? The whole world doesn't need to know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to delete that pic, then. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think there's certain things in life that need to stay private, and I think your sexuality is probably one of them. How many years have I been working on trying to clean up the mouths of this family? Next might be sex talk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think Scott is the one. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All this conversation. I don't even remember why I came over here. Oh, yeah, to get my air compressor. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's in the garage. Isn't it crazy how Bruce is so conservative, and my mom is so not? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Everybody, they're like, "Yo, if I could do anybody in your family, Kris Jenner, baby." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nobody asks me anymore, like, "Yo, hook me up with a date with Kim." She's got the kid. Khloe's married. You've got a bunch of kids with me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm still on the market, even though I have kids. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. Well, I want to put my meat for sale, too, then. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are we talking about other people? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so excited for Nobu tonight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you been to the new one? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, why does that purse look familiar? Did I buy you that purse? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so random to see Kourtney in purple, though, 'cause she hates purple. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, 'cause I hate it, but I like that metallic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Back when you guys were a lot younger, like, teenagers, I gave MJ this really cool turquoise leather Chanel bag. This one, she remembered the bag, and MJ gave it to her the last time we were there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't remember that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't remember much. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you have these childhood memories? Any of the adventures? Like, whenever we go to San Diego or anything? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not one thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't remember I made picket signs 'cause Mom would only make spaghetti? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you remember all the times I took you horseback riding? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, right, like you took me horseback riding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bareback was her middle name at that age. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For years and years and years, we've always made fun of Khloe 'cause she can never remember anything. You don't remember taking religion in high school? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I barely remember going to school. Kim, how old am I? &gt;&gt; KIM: 28? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know for this whole year, I thought I was 27? I've been e-mailing Nicole Richie, and I said, "Do you remember any of my teachers? I can't remember them." And she just wrote back, "Are you okay?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now it's kind of becoming a little bit more serious since she just can't remember anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You got nothing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is not, like, a quiz game. I don't remember it. Like, what do you want from me? I mean, if you want me to be worried, you succeeded, 'cause now I think, like, there's really something wrong with me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have no memory of your childhood. It's bizarre. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my goodness. Hi, everyone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Bruiser. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's happening? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. Can I have that wasabi, please, Kourtney? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where's Lamar tonight? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's playing a game as we speak. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They might have it on in the other room. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, Khloe, what is this photo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, you know, sometimes you got to, like, spice things up a bit. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: For Lamar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For Lamar. I did a photo shoot for Lamar recently. I just feel like you could still be really sexy and be tasteful, and it's kind of liberating. I'm feeling a little good about myself. I'm feeling a little good about my man. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, Khloe, do you really think you should be having this conversation with a 17-year-old? I'm all for spicing up a relationship, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I'm just saying that, especially in this family, photos leaking, this and that... Look at the problems it's caused. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce and I did a video. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What kind of video? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Exercise video, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. : Bruce and I made a sex tape. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it wasn't quite a sex tape. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was a sex tape. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The way he said that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What did you guys do in it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are we talking multiple positions? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But we erased it immediately. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you guys know you erased it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whose idea was it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Obviously your mother's. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was mine. This was, like, 20 years ago, so don't hold it against us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You don't need to do those types of things. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: When I hear that Kris and Bruce made a sex tape, it really baffles me, because Bruce passes judgment on me about anything. I don't know who he is to judge, when he's over here banging people on camera. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Disgusting, man. Ew! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you throwing up? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What happened? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hate you, &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We put wasabi in her ice cream. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You look good on a horse, buddy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I look good on a horse; so does Kendall. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Your e-mail used to be "horse girl." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You remember that? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I remember that! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; LEAH: That's commitment. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I can't believe you remember that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Aren't you overdressed? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, she's wearing a full-on stripper dress and heels. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, thank you. Now, there's a cowboy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, those are not appropriate shoes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was at this meeting I was at. It seemed appropriate. Right now, it doesn't seem so good. Hi, you guys. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm coming from a special sock event for my son, Rob, so I'm a little overdressed for the stable. I'm getting flies all over me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A horse just shakes their skin. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm really trying to be there for all of my kids at the same time, especially Kendall and Kylie, and just making sure that their childhood doesn't-- poof-- disappear right in front of my very eyes. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Should we jump on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wish I had different clothes on. I'd go with you guys. Kendall, you want to go get a manicure? We could try to fit that in this afternoon. Your nails are looking a little grungy after this horseback riding. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm going to dinner with them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, maybe another day? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think it's pretty ridiculous that my mom shows up late to horseback riding with a red dress on and huge heels. She literally looks like she's gonna go to a polo match, not go on a trail ride. This is Brandon and Leah's. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's Brandon and Leah's? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, this is, like, the kind I want. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How cool is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you gonna do with a truck like that, Kendall? You're a young lady that doesn't need a pickup truck. Kendall really wants this truck. Older cars break down a lot quicker, and I don't want her out there when her car can break down on the side of a road, because there's still a lot of really bad people out there. There's no need to have a truck, young lady. I think you're going through a phase. You'll get past it in a couple days. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, he needs to adjust you today. Hold on, come here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's maybe the nicest guy. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, Bible, come here. Dr. Jochen? My sister, Kourtney, has never been to a chiropractor. Can you do an adjustment on her really quick? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, you have to feel this-- it'll change your life. &gt;&gt; JOCHEN: I'm gonna have you lie down here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; JOCHEN: Khloe loves this adjustment. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait for round two. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you done? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh, yes. &gt;&gt; JOCHEN: There you go. You're gonna let me adjust you one more time, though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just watching today, Doctor. I don't want to wear you out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe he could do something to help your memory problems. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, some people just have memory loss. You just have memory loss, right? &gt;&gt; JOCHEN: Not at your age. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was in a car accident. I went through the windshield. &gt;&gt; JOCHEN: How old were you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 16, 17. I don't remember. I was knocked out. &gt;&gt; JOCHEN: How long were you unconscious for? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The whole ride to the, uh, hospital, I thought she was my mom. I got into a car accident in 2001. The car spun out of control, hit a pole. I mean, I know that I had a very heavy concussion. &gt;&gt; JOCHEN: The migraines, have they gone away? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-uh. Getting your head through a windshield is obviously not great for anything, and it definitely escalated my migraines, but I've been having them for years and years. &gt;&gt; JOCHEN: Your body was hit very hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; JOCHEN: So with that amount of trauma, that can knock your memory. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So are we gonna search for this tape or what? &gt;&gt; ROB: Why do you need the sex tape or whatever? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're gonna use it as blackmail. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Blackmail for what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who the hell cares? Money, objects, materialistic items. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: What happened at 13? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I remember our dad was on OJ's side, and my mom was on Nicole's side. I was too young to understand, like, why someone would be accused of doing that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't remember any of these years. '92? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What years do you not remember? You were born in '84. Do you want to take '86? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll take these four. Okay. Kourtney and I have decided to raid my mom's photo albums, you know, just to look at old photos and see if that's gonna trigger anything. What house is this at? The Ninja Turtle Christmas party? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tower Lane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's Tower Lane? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. Look, your favorite person. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. You don't know who that is? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Who is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Auntie Jean. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that's her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, we're looking at photos to, like, spark my memory. Look at Dad. I don't remember this party whatsoever. It's really irritating and frustrating and kind of sad that I don't remember some of my childhood. Like, in ten years, am I gonna forget the best, most memorable years of my life? I mean, I'm getting a little scared, like, something might really be wrong. I'm so sad I don't remember this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, Rob had the biggest balls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to see? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that normal? I-I don't think that's normal! You guys, I think that's infected. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't believe that they had a tape from when they first got together. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He could probably tell you that he thinks it's disgusting that Kim had a sex tape, but if you asked him if he ever had one, it would be okay somehow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So are we gonna search for this tape or what? &gt;&gt; ROB: Why do you need this sex tape or whatever? Like, what's the point of this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're gonna use it as blackmail. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Blackmail for what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who the hell cares? Money, objects, materialistic items, sexual favors. I want to see it. I want to see it bad. I want to see what was going on. These people have been passing a lot of judgment on me for a long time. I want to see what's in their little closet of hell. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, where do we start? &gt;&gt; ROB: We should go in their room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here are all of her movies. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wouldn't be surprised if he's had sex with your mom with the... with the medal on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If I was my mom, I would put plastic, only the medal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This room's huge. It could be anywhere. This looks like the kinky drawer, by the way. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, she doesn't have one of those anymore. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, let's go downstairs and look. It's obviously not here. Should we look in here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Scott. What are you doing here? What are you doing? Kourtney, why were you in my closet? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We were playing hide-and-seek. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In my closet? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so annoyed that we cannot find the tape, but we just can't find it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you guys been drinking? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like this little frog scrubber. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scrubby, scrubby, scrubby, scrubby, scrubby. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scrubby, scrubby, scrubby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Instant diva, just add wine." Ooh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, real bath salts. Let's snort them and eat each other. Open your mouth. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. Why are you guys doing that? Are those even meant for your head? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, they're tutus. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are these tutus for a dog or for a person? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Sometimes it's a little hard to be around my mom and my older sisters. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Lighten up a little bit, Kendall. You're just over there reading a book; have some fun. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I feel like we are interested in different things and we have different tastes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is porn for the working woman. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like this little man, actually. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm your new boyfriend. Give me a kiss. Come on, kiss me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Stop, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're no fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look who it is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's up with the lack of light in here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, you look hot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You do. Well, shake it, big sweet &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just wanted to tell you, big &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ew. Get out of here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look so hot right now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was being serious. I thought you looked good. Don't be an ass. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't like when I compliment you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, not in a mocking sense. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you here for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What I was thinking, we could turn ourselves into Kris and Bruce... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and make this home movie. We could be them. Bruce is so judgmental of everything that anyone does. I want to help Scott get Bruce back for all of the years of judgment that he put my man through. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, wardrobe, hair, makeup. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need a wig. I need bronze lipstick. This sex tape will be so amazing. We can get funk-ified. Clyde is gonna cut you. That's what you're gonna look like. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know what's weirder, the fact that Kourtney looks just like her mother or the fact that I'm gonna have to sleep with her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today I am going to figure out what is going on with me. Dementia? &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Dementia is a form of... it's a loss of memory. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's possible in someone her age? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I cannot wait to start my period, 'cause I need to lose ten pounds. I'm so bloated. Does that turn you on? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did I tell you that I went to one of my childhood schools, like, just, like, to respark my memory? Honestly, like, I can't remember anything. I asked Kourtney and Malika to meet me at one of my old schools. You met my real dad? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yes, before he passed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. Do you know who was here, like, when I went here? &gt;&gt; MAN: History teacher. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't remember her. I'm really trying to understand, why don't I remember things? Like, I don't remember anything from my car accident. Kourtney was like, "You have, like, Alzheimer's." I was like, "Oh, my gosh, I think I do." &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, you're too young for that, but it might be, like, trauma. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it could happen at any age. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Maybe you need to, like... certain parts of your brain have, like, died. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If I could spell it, I would Google it. Yeah, that's not good. "The most common symptoms are confusion, irritability, aggression, mood swings, trouble with language and long-term memory loss." I'm looking at these symptoms, and so far, all I'm doing is, "Check, okay, moodiness. Check, irritability." I want to know if something is wrong, so then we could fix that problem. So what do we do? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Maybe you could go see, like, um, a specialist. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I think I should, 'cause it's... I honestly get concerned sometimes, like, things that I can't remember. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: At least you haven't forgotten us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I really want you to dye my hair black. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's more exotic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know what? I wanted to ask you guys... I am doing buying tomorrow for the store, and I thought, if you guys wanted to join in, then you could pick whatever you guys want before anyone sees it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I don't know if I can tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, it's like shopping... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't think I can. Brandon's taking me to look at 393 00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:17,458 this car. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want a pickup truck? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is this car? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I did a photo shoot with that one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That one's cute. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This one, not so much. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So, I tell Kourtney that I want to get a truck, and she kind of makes a big deal out of it, and I should've known better not to tell my sisters yet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, did you know that Kendall just told me she won't go do buying with me tomorrow because she needs to go look at this pickup truck? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on with the car that you say, this truck you keep talking about and you're obsessing about? Kendall is stuck on the fact that she really wants this truck, and I just think it's a bad idea. It just looks really old, Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's not, like, a big deal. It's me trying to buy my own car with my own money, so chill. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you gonna put in the back? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Boogie board. Surfboards? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not Gidget. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: All right, I don't want to, like, hear about this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just think that's a really bad decision. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Ah, see how I found that for you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, thank you. Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; NURSE: I'm good. Sign your name, and then we have just an orientation and registration for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. I've been to a neurologist when I was a lot younger. My migraines were so bad, but they didn't see anything. I kind of want to go to the neurologist again and, you know, really figure out what is going on with me or if anything is. Hi. I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; VIVAK: How are you? Ms. Kardashian, how do you do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi. Malika. &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Hi. I'm Dr. Savur. You've been having some problems with your memory? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have a lot of memory from, like, my childhood. I'd say I have better, like, short-term memory than I do long-term memory. I just want to know if something is wrong, 'cause I don't remember a lot of stuff that, like, my sisters would remember. &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Usually, this occurs in the times of significant psychological trauma. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When my father passed away, I didn't sleep for, like, literally, like, a month without sleep. That's weird, right? &gt;&gt; VIVAK: When did your father pass away? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I was 19, uh, 2003, and I was very depressed. &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Depression, it's called pseudodementia, because you're so depressed, you cannot remember... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dementia? &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Dementia is a form of... it's a loss of memory. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's possible in someone her age? &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Oh, sure, pseudodementia is depression masquerading itself as forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Did he just say dementia? That's very serious. Backdoor Bruiser, take one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm ready to re-create this amazing sex tape. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're rolling. &gt;&gt; ROB: She looks just like Mom. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: When I'm with them, I feel, like, different. I feel like I'm doing something that I really like to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, we're still your family. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So? I can't go hang out with my other side of the family now that they're around more? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dementia? &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Dementia is a form of... it's a loss of memory. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's possible in someone her age? &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Oh, sure, pseudodementia is depression masquerading itself as forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are we gonna do tests now? &gt;&gt; VIVAK: For instance, let's see if you can remember what you did last night. Do you remember what you had for dinner? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I had a salad last night for dinner. &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Do you remember the names of the last three presidents? 469 00:21:55,183 --> 00:22:00,022 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, Obama, right? Um... I don't know. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Good job. I'm proud of you. &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Taking seven from 100? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seven from 100? 94. I mean, no, four. 93. &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Seven from 93? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, what? I failed math. That's what calculators are for. &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Name as many animals as you can in a minute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Chicken, pig, horse, giraffe, zebra, lion, tiger, bear... The fact that I can't answer some of these questions is truly humiliating, but animals, I'm a pro. ...whale, fish, squid, eel. &gt;&gt; VIVAK: Excellent. I tell you, I can guarantee you, you do not have dementia based upon what you're saying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; VIVAK: If you are specifically interested in that timeframe, getting a hypnotherapist in would be helpful. It certainly may be something worthwhile that you may want to look into. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kourt, come up here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to see the camera we have? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you believe this is what my dad used to videotape all of our stuff with? Isn't this crazy? I was like, please... &gt;&gt; ROB: How do I get that haircut back, though, seriously? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob. &gt;&gt; CLYDE: With a wig. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so, Clyde, Kourtney and Scott are going to re-create Bruce and Kris. I have the photo right here. &gt;&gt; CLYDE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is it on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Chilling out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get it, Clyde. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's nothing worse than getting your hair cut, but there actually is now. It's getting your wig cut. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look miserable, but you look like Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; ROB: You should hang out with Brody. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, surf's up, bro. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, look. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know what's weirder, the fact that Kourtney looks just like her mother, or the fact that I'm gonna have to sleep with her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If I met you like that, I would actually think you were pretty hot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Got to leave a little of that flip, Clyde. &gt;&gt; CLYDE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're getting there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm ready to &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's move upstairs. &gt;&gt; BRODY: When are you moving out on your own? Isn't that coming up soon? Aren't you, like, almost 18? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I mean, I'm planning on it in November. &gt;&gt; BRODY: The big 1-8. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No phones in the wetsuit. We're gonna put this away. You're not planning on putting it in there, are you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nope. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay, your mom keeps blowing you up, by the way. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's all right. She can wait. &gt;&gt; BRODY: She's literally texted you five times. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My mom is randomly freaking out about nothing. She's such a drama queen. She can wait. I like being with my brothers, just 'cause the Jenner side is really laid back, outdoorsy, and the Kardashian side is very glamorous. I think my mom needs to accept that I'm not picking one side or the other. I'm just kind of doing things that are fun for me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Any time you want to stay away from all the drama and come hang out with your older brothers and enjoy some relaxation time, cruise out. You got it. Nice. Oh, careful! Nice save! Oh, that was great. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I knew that would happen, too. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you feeling de-stressed? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Uh, yes. Feeling very drama-free. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you guys think other people do stuff like this? Do pranks and do this? Take things to this extent? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I don't think they, like, try to become their parents and have sex with each other on camera. I mean, look, we pulled the Todd Kraines; we got away with it. Now we're on to the next thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. I love that robe, by the way. That's my favorite robe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I literally stole Mom's lingerie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look so cray. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've stolen my mom's nightgown from 1994, and I feel like now I'm ready to re-create this amazing sex tape. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at me. Don't I just look like a love slave? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I figured we could dub Mom and Bruce's voice over you guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Gotcha. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, we have enough home videos to do that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Honey! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, Kris... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's a good line. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got a Viagra on you? &gt;&gt; ROB: We're not using condoms or anything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I'm gonna go raw. When I started having sex in the '70s, there was a lot of this and a lot of that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, ready, Rob, look at the camera. Backdoor Bruiser, take one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And action. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. I'm Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I'm Bruce. You may remember me from the Olympic Games. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You sit, I'm gonna be going over your shoulder. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So you want a back shot? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes! Yes! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, oh, God. &gt;&gt; ROB: She looks just like Mom. It's perfect. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Never in a million years did I think I'd be re-creating a sex tape of Bruce and Kris Jenner and playing the part of Bruce Jenner, the Olympic athlete. Oh, yeah, baby. Daddy's Daddy'sher. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not rolling yet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't look at me. We're rolling. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do me dirty. We got to get your legs over my shoulders. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There you go. That's a good... That's the money shot. Oh, God, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, I'm getting gnarly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're so good at this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't want to spill your wine, honey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is literally how he has sex, by the way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's how I have sex? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Holy I'm never having sex again. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Do you have anything to say for yourself? Kendall is very late to meet me here at the house for lunch. She didn't text me or call me or send me a message or try to get a hold of me. You kind of stood me up, and it's not cool. I totally didn't raise you like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're gonna have a little screening, a little short video that we found. It dates back to 1994. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What is this? &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: I'm Caroline. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I think of hypnotherapy, I think of you don't have control over your body. I remember not being allowed to see our dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You kind of stood me up, and it's not cool. I didn't raise you like this. You know if you make plans with somebody how important that is to me and how much I've said to you over the years, you stick with those plans unless something terrible happens. So when you don't show up, I worry about you. I'm really trying so hard to go out of my way to spend time with you, and you kind of, like, have total disregard sometimes for what is going on with me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, no, no, no, I'm sorry, no, because I just kind of, like, lost track of time. I really wasn't paying attention. We were out in the water. I didn't have my phone. Like, I just lost track of time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who were you with? Who's "we?" &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Brody. Me and Brody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You and Brody? I do everything I can do to hang out with you and be there for you, even though I'm busy, and the fact that you're out with Brody, it's really hurting my feelings. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I can't go hang out with my other side of the family now that they're around more? I'm having fun with them. That's it. I'm not pushing you guys off to the side. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes it feels like it, though. Sometimes I feel like this side of the family isn't good enough, and that you have been hanging out more and more with the Jenner side and the boys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That doesn't have anything... Everybody knows that I'm the shy one, I'm kind of, like, less outgoing than everybody, and when I'm with them, I feel like... I don't know. I feel, like, different. I feel like I'm doing something that I really like to do. I think it might be hard for my mom to see that I'm growing up and becoming my own person, because I think that she probably still wants to see me as her little girl. I just don't want you to think that I'm, like, totally not caring about you guys anymore 'cause that's not it at all. I just realized that I really like hanging out with them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Hi. I'm Caroline. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you for having me. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Of course. Come on. Follow me back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm nervous just 'cause when I think of hypnotherapy, I think of that you don't have control over your body, and I am a control freak. So I need control over my body. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Tell me why you wanted to do, uh, hypnosis or... what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For a while now, my memory has been pretty bad. Um, 'cause I don't remember major gaps of my life. Like, years that I should have memory. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Sure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I don't know what's going on. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Well, hypnosis is, um, we deal with the subconscious mind, and the subconscious mind is where everything that has ever happened to you is stored there, and the subconscious rules 80% to 90% of our lives, and it's hidden, so people come to hypnosis for various reasons. Death, divorce, illness. What they're really coming in for is to question the hidden mind. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When you do this, does it, like, is it gonna make me remember stuff or is it going to... &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: I don't know, but your... you do know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Your subconscious does know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm, like, having this battle within my head. Like, don't let her do it, 'cause I don't want to wake up, like, naked or something. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Close your eyes and listen to the sound of my voice. Visualize that you find yourself standing at the top of a beautiful staircase. There are five steps. You're going to walk down these steps. Each step will take you twice as deep, starting with number five. Deeper and deeper. Number four, letting go, Khloe, deeper and deeper. Number three, deeper and deeper. 678 00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:29,425 Number two, deeper and deeper. And number one. I invite you to follow the pathway which leads to a small clearing. There is a very large movie screen. There is an image that is being projected. The first image is that of a little girl between the ages of three and six. Choose an age and say it out loud please. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Four. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: This is Khloe at four. What do you think about this little girl? I bet she's really cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She is. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Is she happy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: There is a second image that is being created. That of an older girl between the ages of 11 and 14. Choose an age and say it out loud please. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 13. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: This is Khloe at 13. What do you think about this older girl? Is she still happy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Confused. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: She's confused. And so what happened at 13, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Does any feelings come up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't remember exactly how I felt, but I remember having nightmares. I remember not being allowed to see our dad, because he was on OJ's side, and my mom was on Nicole's side. OJ was like our Uncle OJ. My mom felt that my brother and I were too young to be around that. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: What happened at 13, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I remember having 709 00:34:20,177 --> 00:34:24,715 nightmares. OJ was like our Uncle OJ. And I remember not being allowed to see our dad because he was on OJ's side, and my mom was on Nicole's side. My mom felt that my brother and I were too young to be around that. I was too young to understand, like, why someone would be accused of doing that. OJ Simpson and Nicole Simpson were a part of my life, so when she was killed so violently and disturbingly, I remember that just always stuck with me. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: How did it affect you, though, not being able to see your dad? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was really cold to him when I was a teenager. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: I see. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He died, um, very suddenly. Then after, I chose to not be with my family for a long time. Like, they reminded me too much of my dad. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: There's that part of you that chooses to not be present. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: So when you're not present, then you don't remember. So when things are not feeling good, this little girl devised a way to not be present. This whole thing about forgetting the past. If you want to, Khloe, you can remember. And so allowing yourself just to be at ease and at peace. And... Eyes open. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: How was that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I chose to, you know, be away and obviously to rather not, you know, deal with reality, I guess. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: Yeah, and so these memories are hard for you to retrieve because you were there, but emotionally, you were not there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. I'm really happy that I started this journey to figure out what's going on with my memory, and yeah, there are still a lot of things that I don't remember, but I feel like, with a few sessions under my belt, I think that hypnotherapy could work. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. &gt;&gt; CAROLINE: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, gorge. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was today? What did you do? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I went to the agency, and then I went on a go-see. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you having fun? I'm just so proud of you. I'm just really impressed that you are doing this. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I feel like you get annoyed that I'm so, like, chill, but, like, I get my work ethic from you. I get my fashion sense from you. I'm not all Jenner. I have a little bit of you in me, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw. Kendall has grown up to be this amazing young woman, and she's really different from all of her other siblings. I'm proud of who Kendall is, and I adore her. Most kids your age, they want to do something with their life, but they never go out and do it. You actually are an amazing inspiration. You know what, Kendall? I want you to be doing what you really want to do. I want you to be like that. I don't want you to be sitting in a room all day. You're so mature for your age, and you show me that you can really handle a lot of responsibility because you work so hard. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's really nice to hear that my mom is starting to accept that I am getting older, and I have things that I like that she may not like, but she helped shape me into the woman I am, so thanks, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm proud of you. You're growing up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's so much better at this house. We can actually talk to people and have a good time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, at your real house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have the edited thing here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That tape that we made. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Imitation is the highest form of flattery, Dad. Don't think about it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It is, it is. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When you guys are done eating, we're gonna have a little screening in that room, a little short video that we found. It's a classic. It dates back to 1994. Now that we have the final product, we have come up with a brilliant plan to embarrass Bruce. Since Bruce's vision and hearing isn't the best, we thought that we had a better chance of fooling him if my mom was not here. Let's go turn it on, shall we? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What is this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, are we ready? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm ready. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce, I just want to let you know that you are no angel. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, no. I don't think it's funny. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I had my friend clip their sound bites of their voices. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's unreal. Bruce 1,000% thinks that's him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it's not funny. This is not funny. It's not for everybody to see. This is not good. You know, I remember Kris saying, "Oh, we erased the tape and this and that." What if she didn't? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is not funny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You guys are just sick. This is not funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is not funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce! Bruce, it was a joke. It wasn't really you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It wasn't really you guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It wasn't? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was yours and Mom's voices and we... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you actually put that together? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I give up. Thank God that wasn't real. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just watch it once. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Everybody have a seat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, okay. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. Backdoor Bruiser, take one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're rolling. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't want to spill your wine, honey. We got to get your legs over my shoulders. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, your mom likes the leg up. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's a wrap. Uh, thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, that's great. God, were those the good old days. Honestly, with Kris and I, we certainly, when we first got married, had our wild days, you know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: As much as you pretend to be the same conservative... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We can't curse, we can't talk about sex, but you're over here banging on camera. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can understand why, you know, maybe I should be a little easier on you guys when you have your little sexual talks. You kind of do stupid things, you know, when it comes to sex when you're younger. I mean, in a ten-year period, I had six children with three different women. Oops. Uh, I guess I'm not one to talk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks, Brucey. Backdoor Bruiser. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Those little Olympic swimmers, baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, your whole dress is see-through. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, are you sure? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at your thong. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Still to come this Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You got a really cool camel toe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Myis just too big. Kourtney and Kim, all they do is talk about my camel toe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, they're not the police. &gt;&gt; ROB: A little cardio sesh. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Here we go, Roberto. You all right? You can't be eating no after this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe and Lamar have to try and make a baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you guys so, like, pushy? &gt;&gt; KIM: You should be following up. I don't think that Khloe's been trying hard enough with her fertility issues. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You've got lots of follicles. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So is that good? &gt;&gt; KIM: As soon as I pop this Playboy or some nude shoot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kanye is going to Kim's baby shower? &gt;&gt; KIM: This baby shower is just so pretty and magical. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Have you picked out names for her? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's the hardest part. What if we named her just North and no last name. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, sorry, Madonna. This is insane. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The paparazzi are so crazy, and it's really only getting worse. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're stalking all the rest of the family. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 'Cause they're trying to find her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You.. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Get in the car! &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone's been saying how crazy the paparazzi is. Why would I want to put my child in danger? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you struggling with keeping some things private? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye's not comfortable with having our daughter on the show. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: She weighs exactly five pounds. This is not very good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: My liver is shutting down; I have to deliver the baby right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My kids have weddings in nine days and babies five weeks early. There is so much to do before Kim and Kanye move in. Okay,, she was born. It's her umbilical cord. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, Kim and Kanye are pulling up. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're home. The baby's here.
