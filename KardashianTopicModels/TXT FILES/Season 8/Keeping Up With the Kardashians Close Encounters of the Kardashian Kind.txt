- ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yello! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was just trying on my stuff that I got. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, hello. Ooh, ooh! Okay. Um, you want to get dirty with the night vision? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's, like, serious, serious night vision stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What would you need that for? What is that long thing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know, I guess I love seeing you. I even want to see you in the dark. "What's that long thing?" That's obviously a binocular lens. &gt;&gt; MASON: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look, it's night vision. You can see in the dark with this. It'll show us in the nighttime. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, bring it up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, no! Watch out, watch... Save yourself! &gt;&gt; MASON: I see something. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Watch out, watch out. I see another monster alien coming. &gt;&gt; MASON: Help, Daddy! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna take you... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sorry, but I'm scared of aliens. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna take you 29 00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,491 to the moon. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: What Chardonnay do we usually get? &gt;&gt; KATHIE: Ooh, the Michaels, that... that's a nice... you'd love it, you'd love that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Should we get that? I'll just have a glass of this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: These girls know their wine. &gt;&gt; KATHIE: Usually I don't imbibe that much, but since we ran into old friends, what the hell? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want you to come on... I got a talk show. I'm trying to be just like her. &gt;&gt; CASSIDY: Mom, do you hear that? &gt;&gt; KATHIE: I know, I told her, "It's not worth it, trust me." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KATHIE: Nobody schmears the charm like Kris, nobody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nobody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have been working a long time, and I'm getting a talk show. &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: They were asking me, "Why Kris?" And I said, "Because no one will work harder." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no. My makeup. &gt;&gt; STEPHEN: That-that makeup, that makeup... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm really, really excited. There's so many details. There's meetings, and there's preparation, and there's wardrobe, and there's set design. And I like the thickness, and I like that the "K" is lowercase. This is my dream come true. The first time I ever had to say my name on camera, you said, "Just be yourself." Kathie Lee Gifford has been one of my best friends for over 30 years. She's somebody who's my biggest cheerleader, and she really wants the best for the people that she loves. And I feel the same way about her. &gt;&gt; KATHIE: It's like life. You know, you can't... you can't orchestrate it. You can't make it-- unless you're making a movie, where you tell the actor and the actress exactly what to say. Life isn't like that. Life is ebb and flow. And if you want to have a relationship that seems authentic on the air to people that are watching, you got to let it happen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KATHIE: And so if an audience is uncomfortable, then you're not gonna have a hit show. ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, what did you do to your hand? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nothing, just worked out, hurt my wrist. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that artwork, if you did nothing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I said, "I worked out and I hurt my wrist." You have to wear your hearing aid. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They broke. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They broke? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I went in the shower and forgot to take them out. Aah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I see your menu, or are you using it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, who's excited about camping? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall's always ready to go. the outdoors. Nature, baby. My family's life has been so confusing. I mean, everybody's running around. They got this going on, that going on. I want to get everybody together. I want to have some good family time. So a camping trip is perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's going? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall, Kylie, Brandon, Brody, Leah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Obviously they're going. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got to get some of the Kardashians, and Lamar is the toughest one. Come on, Lamar's got to, like, get outdoors. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar does not go... do outdoors. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We'll get a tent that's extra long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And an extra long sleeping bag so he'll fit in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Even though I don't like camping, right now, you know, I need all the distractions I can get. They're kind of like therapy for me. So, um, this camping trip I am definitely looking forward to. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How crazy about Cory. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So sad, right? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know who we're talking about? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, the guy who died-- I saw on the news. Overdose, it looks like. Lesson to be learned: stay away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stay far away. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really, really, really stupid. What a waste of a life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think it was his choice? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have a hard time with people that need drugs to have a good time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, being a drug addict is a disease. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it is a personal choice. You know what you're doing? You're taking the responsibility away from the person. This guy had a choice to take drugs. It's his own fault. Can't blame anybody else but him. I feel sorry. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I agree and I disagree with both of you. You get yourself into it-- I agree with you there. Like, it is your choice to get started with something like that. But once you've already started and done it a hundred times and now you're addicted, like, I do agree with Khloe. It is a disease at one... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then you'd better realize it real fast and stop real quick. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Exactly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How'd we get on such heavy subjects here? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I don't want to talk about this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're talking about camping and-and having a little dinner. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe we're gonna die on the campground. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe, stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's finally here, the very first day of my talk show. I am so nervous but excited in such a really great way. Ah! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; MAN: Nice to see you, Khloe. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. I have all my girlfriends here. Look at... You guys are so cute and colorful. Bruce is here, Kourtney's here. We got to go? Okay, we're going. I feel really blessed that my friends and family are here to support me. &gt;&gt; MAN: Everyone is gonna be on TV today. We don't want anyone to be shy. The more reactions you give us, the better, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just overwhelming. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The stage looks nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Will I be able to pull it together? Will I freeze? Will I be nervous? I feel like maybe I'll just walk out there and burst into tears because I get so emotional. Okay, where do I go now? On the set? I really want to give 150% to something that is my dream come true. Okay, I'm ready. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Kris Jenner! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everybody sit down! This is gonna be so exciting. You're such a beautiful audience. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're so hot! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, thank you, Khloe! You get a raise in your allowance today. This is my very first show, and I'm so excited. I love the whole talk show world. If I could dream as big as I want, I would dream to be able to get up and do this every single day. So, Kim just had her baby, everybody. &gt;&gt; CAMERON: Congratulations, by the way. Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you, thank you. When we come back, you know all those crazy rumors about Kim, Kanye and Baby North, right? Well, I'm gonna set you straight. Coming up next. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It can't be about us all the time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. We just need to have a talk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We don't want to tear her down. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but this is her one huge opportunity. I think because it's my mom's first show and we want her show to be the best, so we are being very critical of every little detail. &gt;&gt; CAMERON: Kris, where are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is it? Is it the baby? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is it the baby? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's your baby, Monica. This is my beautiful stylist, Monica, and she just needed a bathroom break. So I was just holding her baby. &gt;&gt; CAMERON: Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I literally thought it was North for, like, a split second. And since Kanye is very private about North, I feel like it's not cool. Good job. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is my daughter Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You did so well. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good job. Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? Really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. We just have a bunch of notes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A bunch? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, is it bad? I just finished taping my first show. I just want to take a moment and kind of live on this cloud, but I wish Kourtney could have just waited till a little bit later than to start criticizing my show. She's got to cut me some slack. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: About the camping trip-- Rob, Kendall, Kylie and I have an obsession with aliens. I want to move the location to go to Area 51. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do expect my own family to support me. That's all I'm asking for. Having your children's blessing and having them proud of me means everything to me. This is my dream come true. If it was yours, I swear to God, I would be there every day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What'd you think? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Phenom'. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Phenomenon. Cheers to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you so much. First of all-- Kourtney-- so critical of everything we do, and she's, like, such a buzz kill. She came up to me 30 seconds after I got off stage and said, "I have notes for you." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You on camera are phenomenal. You're made to be on camera. You're so, like, effortless. You're not nervous, and if you are, no one could tell. I mean, I'm so proud of my mom. She actually did an amazing job. And Kourtney could be super critical. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, everybody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It meant so much to me 220 00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,438 that you were here. You have no idea. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, someone got a haircut. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What do you mean? It's been like this for a while. You've seen this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, then, never mind. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Come on, Khlo. It hasn't been that long. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hi, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, doll. Oh, at the beach house. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It wasn't long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, are you guys excited for camping? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yes, very much so. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm very excited. We'll have a good time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so this is the thing. So... &gt;&gt; BRODY: We get to have our guns there. That's amazing. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You get to what? &gt;&gt; BRODY: We're bringing guns. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You're not bringing guns. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm bringing my AK-47. &gt;&gt; LEAH: But why are they bringing...? I'm not bringing guns. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm bringing my Minelli, I'm gonna bring my... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm not bringing any guns. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm gonna bring my Glock .45. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You're gonna wear them all at the same time? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Actually, I'm gonna go get a little holster and just have it on me the whole time. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I won't keep it loaded. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And Rob is bringing his gun? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Rob has a gun, too? &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's gonna be fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, it's, like, the scariest thing for Rob to have a gun. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I think Brody should talk to him about it, because Brody has a lot of guns, but he's also... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm very safe with my guns. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But anyway, so about the camping trip-- Rob, Kendall, Kylie and I... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...have an obsession with aliens. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to move the location to go to Area 51, where you guys could still shoot your guns. Everything is still gonna be the same, but you get on a different freeway. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm definitely surprised that my dad is letting Khloe pick the destination in the desert, but now it's all making sense, because she wants to go alien hunting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But Bruce thinks that I put all this stuff in Kendall and Kylie's heads. He thinks... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, oh, oh, oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He doesn't believe in anything. "There's no aliens!" So, I just can't have him know this is what we want to do. He'll get so mad. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No, he won't. No. &gt;&gt; LEAH: No. I think it'll be... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I'm afraid he's gonna cur... like, cuss me out. Entertain him while... while we just make a different turn. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Please. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I truly am really excited about this alien thing, and I'm happy to deter... &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, let's do that. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: ...Dad's attention, you know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you have no idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Guess what, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I came to dinner tonight without a purse. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's wild. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't have any money. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look so cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do. I have a talk show, so it's my treat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What time do you get to your show every day? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This morning, I got there at 6:30. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks, Rezza. Ok, I'll talk to you soon. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? And this is what time you get off? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. What do you think about my talk show? There's, like, 300 people trying to put a show together, and I'm really proud of it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who's watched it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How can you not watch? Did you see the Kathie Lee Gifford episode? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you see the Diddy episode? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Was it radical? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you see the Maria Menudos episode? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, and that's not her last name. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just lame that you guys aren't supporting me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't watch TV. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tape it and watch it before you go to bed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to come on and cohost one day? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Having your children's blessing and having them proud of me means everything to me. Why aren't you guys jumping at this opportunity? It's making me insecure, by the way. It's not cool if you guys don't give me your full support. And you guys are, like, acting like you don't want to... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is Kanye gonna go on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kanye's not gonna go on, Kim's not gonna come on. She just had a baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Then why are you just asking us? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do expect my own family to support me and to say, "You know what? You're doing the best you can. You're gonna give this a shot, and we are gonna help you make this the best you can." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I called Liz on my 312 00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:34,380 own time, gave her my whole list of every note. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you crying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm just crying because I'm tired. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm tired of convincing you that I'm trying so hard to do the... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's got a lot going on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: To follow my dream. I'm tired, and I'm one person, and I've never done this before. I have stepped onto a stage that I'm not familiar with. This is my dream come true. 322 00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:02,141 If it was yours, I swear to God, I would be there every day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom's been so busy helping Kim and dealing with all of us on top of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just hope Kourtney could be not so bratty. All my mom wants is all of our support right now. She wants us to be a part of everything. Announcement! I am so scared to break the news to Bruce that I am completely hijacking his camping trip. We're going alien hunting! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. Um, I kind of feel, like, bad about dinner. I had no idea Mom was gonna start, like, crying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. I feel bad, too. But I feel like it's just because we want her to succeed and have, like, the best show, and this is her one big opportunity. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, you were so quick to judge the first show, and you haven't even watched to see if she made the changes. She's working so hard, and she's doing such a great job. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I do feel bad, and Mom's been so busy with her new show and helping Kim and dealing with all of us on top of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She wants us to be a part of everything with her. Like, she wants this success about her talk show. Yeah, it's hers, and it's her dream ,but she wants to share that dream with us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think maybe, like, for her to know how much, like, we really do want to support her. Like, why don't we, like, see if we could talk Kim into, like...? Yeah, I know Kim won't go on the show, but maybe if she does, like, a video or something, Mom would, like, love... like, die and appreciate that. And then, for sure, you have to watch the show. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, true. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm about to leave town to go on a camping trip, and I just hope that Kourtney could be not so bratty. I mean, Kourt, wake up. Step up to the plate. Show her some support and just watch the show. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, well, I'm going up the hill. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, love you. 361 00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,331 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, guys. Check out home. &gt;&gt; ROB: Come on, man. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Sounds exciting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Check out home. Today, we're on our way. Honestly, I take this as a personal victory. I mean, look how many kids I got to go on this camper out into the middle of nowhere. It's gonna be great. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: We're on the road, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We are on the road in our camper. I love it. 372 00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,694 Taking the kids. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Taking the kids. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Roberto, I'm gonna tell you something right now. You better get pumped up. Come on, take this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Holy Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ROB: What is going on in there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're getting ready for a tour. We're about to perform. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We have a show tonight. &gt;&gt; ROB: You don't need makeup. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not all of us are like Leah and Kendall. Be diggity, Khlo Money and K-Dollars. Oh, i-it's my... Lameer's calling me. Oh, what up, Lamar? You're on speaker with... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey, playboy! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: How you doing? I love you, bro. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He said, "I love you." &gt;&gt; BRODY: I lo... Hey, I love you, too, brother. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? How you feeling? You feeling okay? So-so. Lamar has been having a really tough time lately. And it's not just black and white. There's a lot of emotional issues. And as much as I'm trying to enjoy going camping with my family, I also have to cater to Lamar's needs. Okay, baby, I'll call you in a little. It's really scary when nothing's really working. And then you know if you give up, no one in his life would be able to help. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you guys doing back there? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What are you doing up there? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm driving. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! Hey! Hey! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Figure out how to drive! Hey! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm-I'm driving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Koke. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Keeks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you with Kourt, by the way? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm in an RV with Kylie. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. That's where you guys went? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're on tour. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're on tour right now. &gt;&gt; ROB: What was that? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I got it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ooh... How did you save it? &gt;&gt; BRODY: The first time was not me, Rob. Don't you dare. &gt;&gt; ROB: Who was it, then? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't know. It wasn't me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just have a quick question 'cause I'm just trying to plan with Mom's, um, show people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, we thought of us maybe doing the video for her. And I just feel like I'm, you know, not ready. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, like, this is Mom's biggest dream and, like, all... Like, we have to be as supportive as possible. All my mom wants is all of our support right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to start supporting you. So I set my DVR. The show is a hit, and Scott wants to cohost with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I know Kim is feeling a little insecure, but all we need is Kim's video and I think my mom will feel the support of the entire family. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm like..."I want to do this for her, but I really..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you have to do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna look like a big fat-ass. People will, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Girl, I get you, boo. But you're gonna be flawless no matter what, honey bunny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bumps! Bumps! Bumps! Bumps! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Whoa! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We'll talk about it later. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, can I drive? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right there. Okay, there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, go slow! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: If I draw a "P"... Say. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, oh, my God. Why are we tilting? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You got it, Kendall! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's not going any faster. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Watch out... watch out for the wind. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That deserves a horn. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We are in the high desert, north of Las Vegas, Nevada. Kendall's driving. This place is Echo... I think, Echo Canyon State Park. This map really doesn't tell us how far it is away, but it's got to be coming up here pretty soon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, like, when we get closer... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, you got a truck coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...um, you know we're supposed to be making a left, but I-I need you to make that right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ready... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to hold in our secret mission alien takeover as long as I can 'cause I feel like if I tell Bruce too far out, he definitely won't let me hijack this RV. Even if he tells you "left, left, left," just go right. Like, do as I say and he'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are we getting close? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, we're about 30 minutes away. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're not distracting my driver, are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I'm not distracting anyone. She's a good driver. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do we have "On the Road Again"? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, I-I know it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why don't you sit down right here. Kendall over here driving. We're going down the highway. It's beautiful. : ♫ On the road again Going places that I've never been ♫ &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You got to get the key right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. I-I... Where d... Where did my key go? ♫ On the road again Yay! &gt;&gt; ROB: On the road again! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now we're really on tour, guys. ♫ Slow down, Ken. Go, um, up there to that gas station. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why are we stopping? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at the dinosaur. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Go faster. Ah! Where are you going? Oh, my God! Just stop the car. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop, stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, everyone! Announcement! I am so scared to break the news to Bruce that I am completely hijacking his camping trip. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have a surprise. We're going alien hunting! I'm Khloe. Nice to meet you. Travis Walton was abducted by aliens, and I want to hear his alien abduction story. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: What does everyone think about you, like, doing a video for your mom's show? &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to obviously, like, help in any way that I can, but I just don't want to do this video. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Bruiser, we have a surprise. Read 'em and weep. We're going alien hunting! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you kidding me? Aliens? Area 51? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Area 51, people! It's right around the corner! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's so stupid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, it's not stupid. You don't get a say-so in this. We're going. I have the two experts that are coming to meet us. &gt;&gt; ROB:Alejandro Rojas and Travis Walton? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait, are we gonna meet these guys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: One of them was abducted by aliens. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys go urinate if you've got to before we go see the aliens! Yeah! Excuse me, I need pretzel crisps. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, for real, we need salt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need salt. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You need salt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe the aliens want ice cream. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you getting? To be honest with you, I'm a little disappointed. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This whole alien thing. I mean, come on. Aliens? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Whatever. It's for fun. Who cares? Just enjoy it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not gonna get upset, but we're going alien hunting? On my camping trip? Khloe has lost her mind. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Rob, are you driving? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I'm getting us the out of Dodge. Gas ain't cheap out here, I'll tell you that much. Ain't what they say in the movies, I'll tell you that much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Rob! Way too fast. &gt;&gt; LEAH: This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, I need to take a picture next to that! I have to make a stop at this Alien Research Center. Like, this is a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity. Do aliens not have penises? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why do you automatically assume that aliens are males with penises? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Whoa. &gt;&gt; LEAH: They said it was real. &gt;&gt; MAN: This is a... This would be a depiction of a gray alien that we've seen. Look, uh, the military is very, very good covering stuff up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, for you to not care, I love that you're taking a picture. That's a good sign. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love aliens, Khloe. Where are we headed next? Area 51! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you being for real? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: An expert is coming onboard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: At least that's what's on Khloe's schedule. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: These are the guys up ahead that we're supposed to be meeting, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: These guys are the alien hunters? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, right up here. I've arranged for Alejandro, the alien expert, to meet us on our way to Area 51. We found this guy who did an article about Kendall tweeting about UFOs. So he is, like, an expert at Area 51. &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: Hello! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: Alejandro. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. Nice to meet you. Hi. I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: Great to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! In 1975, Travis Walton was actually missing for five days. The police even did a missing persons report, and then they found out he was really just abducted by aliens. I want to hear his alien abduction story. I'm really excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. I 'm Bruce. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi. &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are we gonna be able to see some aliens? Khloe really wants to see an alien. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Our dad doesn't... He's a skeptic. &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But we all believe in UFOs, but he doesn't, basically, so... &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: Right, right. 569 00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:50,682 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to hear their story. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank God my lips went down. They were so big. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God, those things were scary. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. They were, like... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I was, like, "How do you make them look smaller?" What does everyone think about you, like, doing a video for your mom's show? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know that my mom, like, wanted me to go on her show, and I want to, like, for her, 'cause this is like a dream of hers, and I want to, obviously, like, help in any way that I can, but I still want to support my mom and, like, help her out. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, this is perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know that my mom probably feels like we haven't really been there for her. &gt;&gt; MAN: And it's for your mom, but it's be... gonna be a great surprise for fans, you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: I always put my family first, but I don't know if I'm ready to do this. But I don't want this to be, like, "She's back." That's what I'm afraid of. 'Cause I'm not, like, there yet. &gt;&gt; MAN: Maybe if you can, like, hold the front in a spot where you kind of like it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this too piratey, though? &gt;&gt; MAN: It's like, um... &gt;&gt; KIM: When I saw my mom wear this in Greece, I wanted to die. I just don't want to do this video. I just feel like I'm not ready. I, like, have nothing that fits me. I feel like I can't wear a black blazer, either. This is, like, my whole pregnanty section of things. Uh, too pregnanty of a top. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: My gut's telling me, "Don't do it." I feel like astuffed sausage. &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: There was this flying saucer, a metal disc, hovering there in the forest. It was just unmistakable. Then I wake up. I look down below, and I recognize the lights of the town. They put this mask over my face, hands all over me. This creature was standing over me, and I just flipped out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm listening to this stuff at the back of the camper. And my kids are just, like, eating it up, and they're actually believing this guy, that he was actually abducted by an alien. Didn't I raise these kids as sensible adults? Guys? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are these aliens? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, be quiet. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, then I want to get a picture of your aliens. We found some. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Let's go, Dad. 617 00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,588 &gt;&gt; LEAH: That was rude. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How far are we going? &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: Watch for the white and the red signs, 'cause we don't want to go past the sign that says "Don't pass here." &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: It's very important 623 00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,100 not to get on military property. &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Is this the sign? &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: That's red and white. &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: Yeah, that's the sign, it looks like. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So, stop? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Warning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So tell Bruce to stop. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Stop, Dad. &gt;&gt; LEAH: "Don't cross, please." &gt;&gt; ROB: What's that person on the top in that truck up there? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: That's a security guard who is watching. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Stop, Dad. &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: He just turned his lights on. &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: Yeah, so stop. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, stop! &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm stopping. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're not stopping, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Wow! This is trippy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're turning around. The guy's up on the hill. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Is that, like, a sniper? &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: Probably. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I'm sure he's armed. Oh, yeah, they're watching. I don't think he wants us up here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: They up there are probably, like, "What is going on?" &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: As long as we don't go past the sign, we're good. &gt;&gt; MAN: Don't cross there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not crossing. With a sniper man. Kylie, Kendall, how crazy is this? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Doesn't it, like, feel, like, crazy? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It feels weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're on a dirt road for miles and miles, like, with no concrete, no pavement, nothing, and then, as soon as it says "restricted," you cannot pass. All of a sudden, there's, like, beautifully-paved streets. So what does this beautifully-paved street go to? I mean, the fact that there is this Jeep, and their high beams go on, and they have binoculars, and they have guns... It's just, it's crazy, and you get the weirdest feeling. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I came up here for a camping trip, and now we're alien hunting. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Thank you for coming and telling your story. &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: It's not easy to talk about, especially for skeptics. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. No, but, uh, and I'm sorry about that. He's just... &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: Well, I'm kind of disappointed, because I've always admired Bruce, and... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Should we hit it? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah, I'm sorry about that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Guys... Brandon. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're burning daylight. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's almost done. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Take a picture with me real quick over here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He goes, "It's kind of disappointing. I admired Bruce." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's so sad. Oh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause Dad was, like, being mean and, like, interrupting his whole story, and, like, sitting there, not listening to anything, and he's like, "It kind of sucks. I admired him." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's load 'em up. &gt;&gt; MAN: Can you look in the camera real quick, Kim? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Smile a little bit. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I'm looking bigger now. I'm too fat. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Lamar's calling Dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's Lamar? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hold on. Here she is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? "Call ended." He hung up on me. I can't stop him from calling everyone's phone. I know it looks weird, and I don't know what to say. 689 00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:54,953 This happens every night, by the way, at least seven times. &gt;&gt; MAN: A little bit more. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so grateful you guys came. This was so interesting and fun for me. &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: Dan Aykroyd was on and he... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This guy is your biggest fan, and he knows all your stats and everything. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get out of here. I've been dragged around the state right now for the last few hours, hunting aliens. I can't take it. We need to get the tent set up, get a campfire going, play a little music, have a little fun, do a little family bonding. Finally. &gt;&gt; BRODY: A few burger patties. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Burgers? Damn it, get a burger. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What are you doing? Go talk to him! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's talking to everybody else about aliens. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He literally... I think they're leaving soon, so, I'm saying you should do it pretty soon, because I feel really bad. I feel like he dressed up for you and everything, like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I will... I will gladly go talk to the gentleman. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Just be very nice. My dad's usually so cool with his fans, but, like, he's not even talking to him. Like, my heart's breaking for Travis. I feel so bad. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He's been really excited to meet you. &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: He's an inspiration. &gt;&gt; BRODY: And he's been talking about your stats and everything, and he knows all of that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I had some good years back then. &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: Whoever even heard of decathlon before him, you know? And you say that word, and that's the only name anybody thinks of. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. Where's home for you? &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: Uh, Snowflake, Arizona right up in the mountains, the same city that I was living in at the time it happened. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No worries. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They haven't scared you out of there, huh? &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: No. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Three, two, one. &gt;&gt; ALEJANDRO: Yeah, it was great to meet you guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So nice meeting you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey, it was really nice meting you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Nice meeting you. &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: Yeah, nice meeting you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm a hugger. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Good man. Pleasure. I'm looking forward to meeting again, we'll definitely do some jamming, and do some playing, that'd be cool. &gt;&gt; TRAVIS: Amen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There it is. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like I need to write down what he told me. Like, I don't think I'm gonna remember. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All the stuff that guy said. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, definitely How emotional he was. Like, he was so emotional. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Please, Khloe. I mean, that's all a bunch of BS. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why does it have to be a bunch of BS? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You really think there's aliens running around abducting people? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do. We all do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ugh, my God, my kids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone's entitled to their own beliefs and opinions. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I wanted to come up here and go fishing, do some camping stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you think we're doing right now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Instead, we spent all day running around looking for aliens. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you think we're doing right now? I get he doesn't believe in aliens or whatever, but he's out to have a bad time and prove me wrong, in my opinion. 755 00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:25,537 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got to grow up and get some sense. &gt;&gt; MAN: Can you look in the camera real quick, Kim? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Smile a little bit, like, with... &gt;&gt; WOMAN and MAN: There you go. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sorry. I don't know why I'm so nervous. It's the day of the video shoot for my mom's show, and I got my hair done and my makeup done, and my outfit's picked out, but I'm just really not feeling good about myself. I don't want to see the ends of my hair. Less people in here staring at me, the better. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, my boobs are squirting out. Do you know that feeling? I'm, like, stressed out, thinking, like, "I'm such a bad daughter," but this is the last thing I want to be doing right now. It's time to feed the baby. I'm so, like, engorged. I can't even concentrate on what I'm supposed to say. I don't know if I can go through with this. I feel like I'm looking bigger now. I'm too fat. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello. Yeah, hold on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, baby. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good, I'm just around the campfire. Can I what? Okay, I'll call you back in a minute. &gt;&gt; ROB: Where's Brody and Brandon? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They went to look at a fireworks place. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Lamar's calling Dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's Lamar? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, hello. Hold on, here she is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Me? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He just wants to see that you're with him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did we lose him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. "Call ended." He hung up on me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's Lamar. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Yes. I'm not with Lamar in L.A. I can't stop him from calling everyone's phone. You're gonna lay outside? What? I know it looks weird, and I don't know what to say. Why do I need a computer? I don't have a... I don't have access to that. Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; ROB: What... what happened with the security cameras? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He wants me to watch them right now. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why, to show you what he's doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't... I don't... : I don't know what's happening. I just can't handle... When I am uncomfortable, I start laughing. I choose to laugh to keep from crying half the time, and that's just the truth, and I would rather laugh than cry. &gt;&gt; ROB: This happens every night, by the way, at least... seven times. There's so much going on at the Odom household that nobody really understands nor should they at this point. Um, I just happen to live there. All I can do is support my sister. He just doesn't sleep. His hours are bizarre. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's so funny, though, that's him, but that-- he's been like that forever. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Are you still alive, Dad? Let's do the fireworks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My beautiful little camping trip. All day long we've been hunting aliens, and what do they want to go do is, you know, shoot off fireworks. &gt;&gt; ROB: Get ready for the light show. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Dude, I'm getting a weird vibe. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I'm getting a weird vibe, but... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Do you feel that-- a little something? Oh, dude, thatis freaking me out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, yo, there's this river over here. Ithink people are dead over here. I'm serious. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Rob is freaking me out. What the? I keep hearingbehind us. I'm not kidding. You hear that, you hear that? Did you not hear that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go, we're, we're done. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Did you not just hear that guy that...? I swear to you... &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh, I'm not even... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You guys, I'm actually scared, so let's, like, hurry up. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Do you hear that? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What theis that? Holy (overlapping chatter and screaming) &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So now he's, um, M.I.A.? If someone wants to leave, they want to leave. You're not my child. I can't lock you in a room, as much as I would like to. He cannot cut off ties with me like that. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Do you hear that? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What theis that? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey, there is something. Rob... there's something. No, no, no, what theis that thing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Honestly, at this point, I have accepted the fact that we're getting abducted. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Please turn the lights on, please. I'm not even kidding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought there was only one! Where are my sisters? What is happening? What, what, what is happening? Who are these people? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, this is just a couple of the homies. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Once Brandon and I found out that we were going alien hunting and Khloe was wishing to see some aliens, we decided to make her wish come true. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I feel like he needs to be off the grass, making noise, a little bit of noise, like, "What is that?" &gt;&gt; MAN: We have sticks and stuff to break, yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Okay, okay. &gt;&gt; MAN: Behind a tree or something, and someone goes, "What was that?" That's how simple it can be. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, it's gonna be so scary! &gt;&gt; ROB: You all are little That's crazy. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, I had him so baited, and Rob was like, "Leah, want me to shine a little light for you?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Brody, you knew about it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Even though everyone's laughing, I still believe that those are real. Like, they look so real. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get in there and take a picture with the aliens. Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aren't they scary? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This was a pretty crazy prank. I am very impressed. Props to the Jenner boys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wait a second. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Let's turn the lights back on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, let's just get theout of this dark place. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, Bruiser, it was fun, huh? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, good job on the... on the aliens. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, so true. My little girls-- what am I gonna do with you, huh? She gets her driver's license next week. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: So, what do you have to do-- the driving test, right? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You guys, I think I'm gonna fail, I'm scared. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No, you won't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why are you scared? You can't be scared. You got your sweet 16 coming up. Oh, God. You know, you're my last child, and you're the last one to get your driver's license. You know, I came out here to go camping and spend some great time, do a little family bonding, but if it takes going and, you know, looking for aliens to be able to have a great conversation with your daughter, you know, then hey, then it's all worth it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's a big moment for a dad is when the youngest gets her driver's license. It's... it's all over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hey, camper. What's going on? &gt;&gt; ROB: You ready to get out of here now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're ready to get out of here. I got the last tent loaded. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, I could do this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My little hula-hooper, I have to admit, on this camping trip, it really was-- the whole alien thing really was a lot of fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wasn't it fun? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A family experience, family memories. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was a family experience. All right, let's get out of this alien-infested country. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: I went to the house to bring Lamar his breakfast this morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And? &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: He wasn't there and he's not answering his phone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, um, now he's, um, M.I.A.? &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been down this road way more times than I would probably like to admit. He won't answer, so, um, I will just wait till I get home. If someone wants to leave, they want to leave. You're not my child. I can't lock you in a room, as much as I would like to. 918 00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:38,262 He cannot cut off ties with me like that. Captioning sponsored by Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ah, kids. See, you need to learn this about your daughter. They never leave. Robert spent the night with me last night, so I was thinking-- in the middle of the night when I went to sleep, I woke up and I thought, "Kim's here, Rob's here, Kendall's here, Kylie's here. That's four out of six of my kids and one of my grandchildren." It's the day of my final show, and what an amazing season. My family has really gone over and beyond to show their support for me. Khloe cohosted not once but twice. She did everything. She put on a sumo-wrestling suit for me. My God, she gets a trophy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Super duper sexy sumo winner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott cohosted with me. Kendall and Kylie came in and did a fashion show. You look gorgeous. Kim even did a video. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom, I just wanted to say congratulations on your new show. &gt;&gt; KRIS: To have Kanye do the finale-- wow. &gt;&gt; KANYE: It's a thread of love, fatherhood and helping me to be a better person. It's every mom's dream to do something like this, and then to have your children really support you, and I got to watch my dream come true right before my very eyes. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So, this is Kendall's pig. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kendall? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: She's on that photo shoot in New York. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, who's taking care of thepig? &gt;&gt; CROWD: Happy birthday, Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you guys so much. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Relax, relax. Scott's been drinking, and we're at a sweet 16. Like, get it together. Stay here. I'm going. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm in desperate need of fixing myself, so I'm 100% moving out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think it's good timing? 957 00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:43,974 Like, why do you choose to do this, like, now?
