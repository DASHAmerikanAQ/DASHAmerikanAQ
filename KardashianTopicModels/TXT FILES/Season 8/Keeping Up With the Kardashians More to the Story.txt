- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where... Is Lamar here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar is in training camp. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? The season's not on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like... He's at a stay-away camp. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Stay-away camp? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, they go for a week or two, 'cause now they have new additions to their team. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who knew? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Lamar? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's definitely around here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's in the pantry? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm looking in the man room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The door is wide open, kid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Try to hide him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You definitely do try to hide him away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Lamar? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is going on here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's finding Lamar. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Lamar? Lamar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You told Lamar to leave. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what I did. I preplanned all this, Kourt. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where is he? Lamar? He's somewhere. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know why I'm, like, in, like, a weird mood. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What kind? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, kind of Debbie Downer, but there's no reason. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your hair is probably a little bit annoying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, this hair gives me... I needed my ghetto fab. I was born to be, like, a hoochie mama. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That bitch Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, how they try to whitewash me is way too much. I am not an elegant person. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Welcome to the street, baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't worry. I'm baby-stepping my sisters back into the real Khloe. Khlo Money has got to come back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Word. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is my OE? I need a drink. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, how jealous am I right now of Kendall Jenner? Even when I'm not pregnant, I will ever look like this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How great is this? Like, having all of you guys here? Whenever we have time and our schedule permits, it's really fun to get everyone together for family day. &gt;&gt; MJ: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We like to get a massage and lounge by the pool and hang out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to get some bread and feed it? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, let's go get some bread and feed it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Try to relax, but together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Feels good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just make sure her, um, phone is turned off. You have to turn your phone off. That's the rule today. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're such a liar. You have it under the covers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I could've brought my dog here. He would've had fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You could've. I could've brought my dog. Gabanna would've loved the pools. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew, Gabanna can't swim in the lake. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Gabanna swims in the ocean. Five-foot waves, and Gabanna's, like, crashing right through them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, your dog is better than my dog. Your dog never drops a Frisbee, and my dog could learn a thing or two from your dog. I get it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you throw him in the pool yet? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He didn't like it. He was very unhappy with me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why don't I train him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Listen, it's my dog. I am pack master. We have an understanding, Bernard and I. Stop trying to make my dog... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just don't baby him. Toughen him up. Khloe has absolutely no idea how to train a dog. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't put him in the pool yet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just throw him in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. It's too cold. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God, it's a dog. Come here, buddy. No, don't you go anywhere. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't put him in the water. Bruce, it's my dog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When you have a dog in the home, you really want the dog to be, you know, well trained, so you know, you... it doesn't, you know, take over the house. You don't want to make him a mushy, little, wimpy dog. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, Bruce, I wouldn't. Oh, the room looks so pretty painted. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, so much brighter, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So much. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, do you like that crib or this crib? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For the beginning, I mean, this is very big for a teeny, tiny baby. So that's why a lot of people use that, 'cause they're more comfortable. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to make sure that I'm doing this all right. I just want to be perfect. Whee! Whee! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, every person knows how to do this. You'll learn if you don't. Don't stress out about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't know how to do one single thing, and I... Mom used to freak me out and be like, "Is the paint color right? Did you wash the clothes?" I was like, "Mom, people had babies in caves." You will be fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Didn't I just say that a second ago? Hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you say, "People have babies in caves?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I didn't say that. But you wouldn't know because you don't listen, and then whenever I start talking, you talk over me to get Kim's attention, because you have kids, and you think that you're holier than thou, and that you and Kim have this connection. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is so crazy to me that not even two years ago, I was at a fertility clinic with Khloe, and the doctor tells me that I hardly had any eggs, and here I am, with no help, just got pregnant, and I see how much Khloe wants this, and I want to help her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why is this place so messy right now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is Lamar messy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I mean, duh, but I don't care. Bern, what are you doing? I am meeting up with Bruce because Bruce wants to train my dog. What are you doing? Hmm? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's like, "Your dog is just horrible. Like, how do you have an animal like this? And you should've got a lab." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at this, look at this, look at this. The dog is totally out of control. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Even if I don't know how to technically do it, I want to learn. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Gabanna at six months, I mean, knew everything. Getting it down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My dog is fine. My dog is great. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bernard! What's the deal here? Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you yelling at my dog, though? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Give it to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, don't pull like that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at that-- he tore up-- look at my blanket. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here, Bernard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your mom just gave me that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll get you a new one; he didn't mean to. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want a new one, I want this one. Look at him, he's still going after it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's a dog, he's a puppy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This dog needs... Look at him, look at him. That's the most exciting thing that's happened to me in a long time right there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, this dog needs some serious training. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's six months old. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is Khloe's first dog. She's got a lot to learn on training, but Lamar, I guess it's his first dog, too. Come on, show me... Tell him to sit. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Sit, sit. Come on, come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not run. That's what you shouldn't do with a dog, 'cause then it gets hyper. And Bernard's a great dog, but it needs some discipline. There he goes again. Look at him, look at him, look at him, look at him, look at him, look at him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a bowl of food. You're trying to tell me Gabanna wouldn't do that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, 'cause I would say no, and immediately... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bernard, no. See, look, he listens to me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah, right there, yeah, there. What are you gonna do when you have a kid? You gonna let him do anything they want? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Bruce. I'm pretty good with kids. Don't worry. Watch how well he listens to me. Bernard, come here. Come with your mommy. Come here. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bernard, come here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nope, come on. He doesn't know what a whistle is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Bernard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Underwear. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why do you have those in your bag? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was shaving in the vajayjay area. I cut theout of myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had to put white, thick cream... &gt;&gt; KIM: So don't wear thongs. Use, like, Neosporin. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I put everything in there. There's four different things in there trying to heal it. So because it's all-- it gets goopy, so I had to midday change 166 00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,398 my underwear. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, Mom. Do you think Khloe should adopt? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think Khloe would make a great mom, and it just depends on if her and Lamar really want to have a baby that bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: For, like, the longest time, Khloe was so serious about experiencing motherhood. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you trying to get pregnant? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what happens when you have a husband. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you're trying to have a baby? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I had to do another ultrasound, but I'm not... He said that there's no eggs. Nothing ishappening. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really feel like things have really changed, and I don't know what's holding her back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you're obsessed with having a baby, you don't think about anything else. When you are in that state of mind, you-you will do anything. She's not in that state of mind. 183 00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:38,084 She hasn't even finished... It's like she doesn't care. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I recruited Rob to kind of help me out to get this dog trained. Now, Bernard, you start pulling like that, this is what you got. Got you the bad boy collar. &gt;&gt; KIM: What about just meeting with an adoption attorney? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't press your luck, 'cause now you're being annoying. Pregnant or not, you're annoying. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just trying to help. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me have that bread. &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me have the bread. &gt;&gt; ROB: I want one so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me the bread. Thank you. Okay, we're gonna put it over here on the chair and let the chair have the bread. &gt;&gt; ROB: When I was in, like, fourth grade, I would always dip the bread in my Sprite. Or cranberry juice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. I-I feel like every single time I have lunch or dinner with you, I learn something new about you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Do you want to know something else? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I have a nine-inch penis. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think it's something that you should tell your mom about. So, what's new? &gt;&gt; ROB: Supposed to go to Victory's house later today. I need to grab-- my Vespa's been over there. I rode it once to his house, like, 'cause I didn't have a car, and it's been sitting there ever since then. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm done getting you guys great Christmas presents 'cause you don't appreciate it. Every year at Christmas, I try to get the whole family something that they'll really enjoy. And last Christmas, we all got motor scooters. But apparently there was one little stinker that didn't like their Christmas gift very much. I want to go over to Kourtney and Scott's and see if Scott's is in the garage. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's for sure not in the garage. You see what he does with all his cars and stuff like that. He loves to sell things. I'm sure he sold Kourtney's, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! We're going over there right 222 00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:38,037 now and see if they have scooters in their garage. Come on, Robert, let's go. &gt;&gt; ROB: No one's here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hate accusing anybody of something unless I really know for sure, so I'm gonna check out Kourtney and Scott's house, and see if Scott's scooter's here. Look how many motorcycles he has. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, 'cause he sold his for one of these dirt bikes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? What a piece of At least Kourtney still has hers. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, he told me he... &gt;&gt; KRIS: He'll probably sell it out from under her. I'm surprised he hasn't sold all these cars. Poor Mason. Somebody's coming. I think it's Kourtney. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom, no one's here. Come on. 238 00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,622 &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, we're gonna see if we can find the title. Look, he just leaves his jewelry. Look at all these socks he has, and they're not even Arthur George. You should take all these socks and replace them with yours. &gt;&gt; ROB: What a traitor. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? Lord Disick? He has his bills sent to Lord Disick? Look. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo, I'm taking these. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Somebody's home. I hear somebody. &gt;&gt; ROB: What the? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go. Shoot. &gt;&gt; ROB: Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get out this way. Come on. Come on, we're out of here. Let's make a run for it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Bruiser? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; ROB: Do your whistle. Whistle, dog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, the dog's here? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bernard, come to Grandpa. I recruited Rob to kind of help me out to get this dog trained. Bernard's a good dog. It just needs some work. I've already done a couple of training sessions with Bernard behind Khloe's back. Sit. No, I'm... Come on. Ready? Okay, come here, come on, come on, come on, nope. Don't be playing with yourself. Let's go. In the end, Khloe's gonna be really happy when Bernard, you know, like, sits and stays and is well-behaved. &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe's gonna be home in a couple hours, so let me know and I'll pick Bernard up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, yeah, no. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got it. Come on, follow me down here. Come here, buddy. Now, this is a good... this is leash training. Turn around. That's good. And sit, sit. Now, Bernard, you start pulling like that, this is what you got. See that? Got you the bad boy collar, yeah, for dogs that aren't doing very good. All right, sit. Yeah, dog. Bernard still has a lot to learn, but I've got farther with him in the last couple of days than Khloe has in the last couple of months. I pride myself on my ability to train dogs. Bernard! Come here. I don't know if I'm gonna use this, but we're gonna check this thing out. You know what? As long as you don't run away, it works pretty good. Let's go. Aha! What did you do here, sir? Bernard! That's a no. You go outside for that. No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, little Vespa seller. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's me, baby. You looking to sell yours? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nope. Today I was on the phone with my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Remember on Christmas day when we said, "Let's all go somewhere on our scooters together"? I'm gonna plan a family scooter day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think my mom will be especially hurt that Scott got rid of his gift 'cause he loves cars and motorcycles and, you know, she just thought he would love to ride out of anyone. People put thought into gifts that... and you return all of them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If I'm not gonna use them, what am I gonna keep them for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know that my mom wrote us cards for Christmas, and you never opened yours. See this card from Christmas? Never opened. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was keeping it 305 00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,957 sealed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Open it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: "You have such a huge place in my heart, so I hope you'll enjoy this scooter. And let's go on some more amazing adventures and make some more fabulous memories. I love you. Kris." That's beautiful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna save this. You are just the ultimate douche kebab. I am not surprised that Scott sold his scooter because he is the king of returning presents. Like, nothing is up to the Lord's standards. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't make me feel bad about this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but you should. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel bad? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Give me your arm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That... I don't like that. I don't like that at all! That hurts, that hurts a lot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what you deserve. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wouldn't mind you doing that on one of my testicles when I was half-asleep. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I will do... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ow! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I will do that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Kik-a-leek? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not weird at all. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, I'm just chilling by myself in the grotto. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Grotto? Who do you think you are? Hef? &gt;&gt; KIM: I love it out here. I'm so tired, though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is, like, gorge out here, but why do you want to meet me out here? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, so, have you talked to Dr. Surrey? Have you been following up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I haven't seen Surrey. But why does that matter? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just, like, you should be following up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you guys so, like, pushy, like, push, push, push. Everyone is so pushy about this whole thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's just such a fun time and you should do it with me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I'm sure it is a fun time, but when I'm supposed to be, it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; KIM: What about just meeting with a adoption attorney? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would I meet with an adoption attorney? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because... just to get informed. Like, when I went to Surrey, I almost did the process. I want to know about it. I have so many questions. I want to know what my options are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not ready to continue with fertility treatments. There are, you know, some things that not everybody knows, and me and Lamar are the only two people that do need to know that. If I consider going, would it make you get off my case a little more? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it would. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that a deal? &gt;&gt; KIM: Deal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can we shake on it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. 358 00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,311 'Cause that's something that you, I feel, like, would be into. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is adopting? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. What is so funny? Like, you're really running from this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: You're uncomfortable, you laugh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I don't really know what your problem is. I already shook on it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are obviously trying to avoid something and you're afraid of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I told you I was going, so I'm going. So don't press your luck. Because now you're being annoying. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just trying to help. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Pregnant or not, you'reannoying. The doctor, um, wants to see you again... Hello? He's so weird right now. No one really understands what someone's going through unless they walk, you know, a mile in their shoes. I have anxiety now, and I'm like, let's draw my blood and let's go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Scott, Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He told me his scooter was in the shop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guess who says he has to cancel. We are gonna bust him today if it's the last thing I do. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so where does Victory live? &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh, just make a left here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. So every single family member has RSVP'd to my mass e-mail. It's about Scooter Day. Guess who the only person who didn't e-mail me back was. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I know. Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's embarrassed. He sold my gift. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I hear you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's embarrassed. &gt;&gt; ROB: I hear you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I should definitely call him and just see if he'll squirm a little bit. &gt;&gt; ROB: He's not gonna be home. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, it's Kris. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know, I still have caller I.D. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just driving Rob over to his friend's house to pick up his Vespa. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, speaking of Vespas, you never replied to my e-mail. It's about Scooter Day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me know the time and day and, uh... &gt;&gt; ROB: She already did. She sent you an e-mail. Be there. This weekend, buddy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm... I'm ready to go whenever you want. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'm down. &gt;&gt; ROB: Talk to you later, &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; ROB: I'd be surprised if he actually comes. ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, how have you been feeling? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I give you orange juice today? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So the baby will jump. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just mix it up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never feel her yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Except that one day by the pool when her legs were protruding out of your stomach and it scared me. I was like, "Okay. Don't want to touch her." &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim is super pushy, and really the only reason why I agreed to go to this adoption lawyer is really to get Kim off my case. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, obviously, this isn't about me. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim has kind of brought this to me, like, would I ever adopt? I don't know if I'm there yet. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Okay. Well, um, what questions did you bring into the room? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if I don't want to know who that family is that's giving their child up, but I do need to know if someone just has mental illness in their family, or any of those things? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Mm-hmm. You have a right to know all of that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you say, "Okay, I want to adopt," and then you pull out of the process, you're like, "Okay, I don't want to." Is that frowned upon, if you want to then reapply? &gt;&gt; DAVID: No, it's not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; DAVID: It's also very common. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Because my husband travels a lot, is that a negative thing? &gt;&gt; DAVID: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. It's not that I'm against adoption, but right now I'm in a place in my life where there are a lot of moving parts. Lamar doesn't know where he's going to play basketball, and it's complicated. I appreciate you meeting with us. &gt;&gt; DAVID: You're welcome. Do you have any other questions? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't. I feel very informed. Um, now have to marinate all this information. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A lot of information. A lot. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't quite figure out what's going on with Khloe. And I'm just so confused. I thought this was such a great idea. I don't understand. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not gonna ride around my neighborhood on a scooter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe that Scott sold his scooter. I just can't take it anymore. I can't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Am I what? No, I'm not, Lamar. No. Can I call you when I'm done, please? I do love Lamar, but it's really scary when someone's in such a deep low. There's only so much anybody could take. ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bernard? Come here! Come here. Bernard, see this right here? That's not good. You are being very naughty. (Rob speaking indistinctly with accent) I'm trying to teach him how to be better on the leash. Bernard, sit. Yay! Lay down. Good job! Yay! Do all dogs learn that so fast? &gt;&gt; ROB: When... you push them down to the floor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't push him down to the floor. Let's see if that was a coincidink. Lay down. Lay down. Good boy! &gt;&gt; ROB: Dang, it's hotter out here than a big bowl of choc-chocolate soup. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sit. Bernard, sit. Shake. Good boy! You're my little cutie pie. You're my little cutie pie. I think I'm doing a pretty phenomenal job with Bernard. I mean, you can't expect a six-month-old child to just run around and do track and field. I have a little puppy. It takes time. Oh, it's hotter than molasses out here. That's our lesson for the day. &gt;&gt; ROB: Come on now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know why you talk like that all the time. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's hot out here like a day at the end of the summertime. ♫ : Can't even be cool on here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, especially with your sister hugging you. &gt;&gt; ROB: How do you really expect us to use these things? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're such a baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scooter Day is here, finally. I'm really excited because I have not done this in ages. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob. Where's your helmet? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's in the trunk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, he has to wear a helmet, legally. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you have to wear a helmet. You'll get a ticket, I... &gt;&gt; ROB: Legallyyou. I am the law. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, it's so sad that you can't ride one of these. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My feet, like, barely touch, and then I almost sprained my ankle just now. &gt;&gt; ROB: Put this... put this in there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are we just gonna hang out here, waiting forever? Where's Scott, Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All I know is that 503 00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,839 he told me his Vespa's in the shop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guess who says he has to cancel. He's not answering the phone. Does he think I'm stupid? I don't like to be jacked around. Scott, you are so transparent. We are gonna bust him today if it's the last thing I do. Let's go over to that place that he takes his cars, because I promise you... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...thatis lying to me. All right, kids, let's go. 514 00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:10,175 ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Was that truck honking at us? &gt;&gt; ROB: This is literally the most degrading thing for a man. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. So, does, uh... my son-in-law Scott have anything in here? &gt;&gt; BENNY: He has, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Benny Joon. &gt;&gt; BENNY: Yeah, he has that little black car right there. &gt;&gt; ROB: Which one? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's his? &gt;&gt; BENNY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that an old Maserati? &gt;&gt; BENNY: That's an old Porsche. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, that's so cool. &gt;&gt; BENNY: That's like the James Dean car. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, one... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do I look cool? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I think I could make you look cooler. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, then, do it. That's your job. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott doesn't have a bike in here? &gt;&gt; BENNY: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does anyone know where Scott is, then? Kourtney? &gt;&gt; BENNY: I'm gonna go meet him for lunch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're meeting him for lunch? &gt;&gt; BENNY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where? &gt;&gt; BENNY: Banzai. I'm gonna go in like five minutes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I think we have to make a little road trip to Banzai, kids. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is so pathetic and embarrassing. At this point, there's nothing that I can do to help Scott get out of this situation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, get on your bikes, sisters. 545 00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,421 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right. ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, what is going on?! &gt;&gt; BENNY: You didn't know? She's like, "Is it here?" And I'm like, "No." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, guvnor! We just saw the Benny Benzino already at the car shop. We did. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am over this whole situation with you and your scooter. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wanted to go have a good time with you guys and have a family outing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'd ride a scooter on a vacation, but I'm not gonna ride around my neighborhood on a scooter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I went to the place where you said that you were having your scooter fixed. You sold it and you lied to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't sell it. I traded it in for a motorcycle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was a gift, and it meant a lot to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just want to enjoy what I have in my life. I'm not a scooter rider. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just can't take it anymore, I can't. Scott, I just can't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, you know how sentimental my mom is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe that Scott sold his scooter. Now he's trying to turn it around on me like I bought him the wrong gift? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom got us the scooters so that we could have 570 00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,568 the memories and ride 'em all together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to go! I am a little nervous about being examined. &gt;&gt; MARK: You got lots of what are called follicles. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, is that good? ♫ &gt;&gt; SANDS: Did I even show you this tooth? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; SANDS: This is what happens when you live with the candy man too much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, ew, that is so disgusting. &gt;&gt; SANDS: All right, sweetheart, so now we're gonna get you numb. Just gonna be a little pinch. Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SANDS: Here we go. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hi, doll. Don't mean to creepily look over your shoulder. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you here? Rob, why are you here? &gt;&gt; ROB: Just to show, show some love. &gt;&gt; SANDS: That's very nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, the surprise visit from Rob I don't really get, because how am I supposed to communicate? What could Rob want that he couldn't wait to tell me about? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'll be back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yo, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo, Bruiser. I'm just at the dentist with Khloe. She'll be home in an hour for sure. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I got an hour. Then I'll get the hell out of here. &gt;&gt; ROB: And you taught me very well with, like, not having unprotected sex. Just teach the dog the same tricks you taught me growing up, okay? Tie over the door handle. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, will do. 600 00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:22,194 Tie over the door handle. ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Is this the stop sign? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That I got pulled for a ticket? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. And there was a cop in the neighborhood earlier. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I saw him. The rent-a-cop? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, telling someone to pull over, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dude's such a migraine. So, Kim keeps texting me about adoption. She just wants me to like, know all my options. It's just so weird. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not that there's anything wrong with adopting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, there's nothing wrong with adoption. I still want... &gt;&gt; ROB: I thought you found out the problem the last time. Something that Kim also had? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Kim and I don't have anything the same. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, well, I thought it was something that you both found out together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We found out together. It's just we have different stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is there more stuff you could be doing to be, like, proactive? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, with everything going on in life, it's so easy to get consumed in other things and not really put yourself as a priority. I do appreciate Kim's persistence, so I am gonna go to the fertility doctor, I mean, just to at least have knowledge on what's happening with my body. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm here to say sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You hurt my feelings and you lied about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe, what's 630 00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,578 happening? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm really, really ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe, what's happening? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm really, really pissed at you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What did I do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I found this on my dog. This is mean. I found this prong collar around Bernard'sneck. Rob, what is this thing on my dog's neck? I do not want a prong going into my dog's neck. Why would you put that on him? &gt;&gt; ROB: I didn't touch your dog, man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You didn't touch my dog? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Then how did it get on him? &gt;&gt; ROB: 'Cause Bruce has been with the dog. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm livid that Bruce would go behind my back and put this collar on that he would know that I would be completely against. He has a collar on him! It's a blue collar. There's no prongs that poke him! Why would you put this on him?! And why wouldn't you ask me first to see how I felt about it? That's animal cruelty. I don't like that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not animal cruelty. I wasn't jamming it in him and stuff, but it certainly would get his attention. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He is great the way he is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay! Tell you what. It's all yours. Good luck. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I just don't think you'd be able to do it. 'Cause you're not tough enough with the dog. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, that's mine and Lamar's dog. When I was younger and I used to babysit, and you would always say to me, "It's not your place to discipline Kendall and Kylie. They're my kids. Let me discipline them," right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, practice what you preach. I want to train him a certain way and act a certain way, and I just wish you would, you know, respect that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. I apologize. I'm sorry. Raising kids is a challenge. You want to help 'em as much as you possibly can. But in the bottom line, you know, you gotta kind of do it yourself. You got to make your own mistakes. I apologize. The dog is yours. And I want you to do your best to train it. And good luck. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm out of it. Love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And we both love Bernard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm, my little puppy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my gosh. Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Going to the navy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The navy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, boo. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And what's with the red lips with you girls? Is this back? Are you bringing it back? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. Too many questions. I'm gonna go upstairs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it was one question. 687 00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:23,201 What are you staring at? ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ♫ Paparazzi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, learn to sing fun at one time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I thought that was fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you're so... ♫ Breathy and Celine Dion. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, Celine Dion? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ♫ Oh, our child sings so great. ♫ Let it flow. Be, like, ♫ Paparazzi, oh! Yeah, paparazzi, popozao ♫ I'm talking popozao I'm talking popozao. ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, you want to do a remix. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do a remix, yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ♫ I'm talking pop, pop ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ♫ Pop-pop-popozao I'm talking pop, pop Pop-pop-pop-popozao. ♫ I don't want to go! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you gonna come or no? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to check out our eggs anymore, okay? I am going to Dr. Surrey's today to see what the situation is with my eggs. I really cannot believe that it's been a year since I've been here last. I'm definitely nervous for my results, but I cannot go a year without coming to the doctor. Hey, I'm about to get my blood drawn. You okay? After this I'm heading home. The doctor wants to see you again. Hello? After I get my blood drawn, I'm heading home. I'm in Beverly Hills at the doctor's. Mm-hmm, and then I'm heading home after I get my blood drawn. Okay. He's so weird right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where is he? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At home. He's, like, "I really need to talk to you." And I was like, "Okay." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is the scariest thing ever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am not someone who really likes to, I guess, bore people with my problems. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does he do that all the time? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's why I have anxiety now. And I'm like, "Let's draw my blood and let's go." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I also think that no one really understands what someone's going through 727 00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,957 unless they walk, you know, a mile in their shoes. Hello, sir. &gt;&gt; MARK: How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; MARK: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice to see you. Have you ever met Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I haven't. Hi. &gt;&gt; MARK: Kourtney, Mark. Nice to see you. How you doing today? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. &gt;&gt; MARK: So, um, first of all, just from the perspective of your general health, everything seemed to be fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; MARK: Uh, from the perspective of your fertility, remember you did ultrasounds? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; MARK: The egg maturing was not happening in your body. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fun. &gt;&gt; MARK: It may be different now. I'd like to see if you are as you were, 'cause people change. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm a little nervous about being examined. I'm scarred from the last time. It was probably the worst time of my life. I'm putting on a brave face, hoping for the best, and I mean, all we can do is just see what happens. &gt;&gt; MARK: See that area there? That's where you carry a pregnancy. So far, it looks normal. Now, if you look over on this side, you can see, uh, that there are some dark circles there, meaning that you got lots of what are called follicles. Those are where eggs come from. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So is that good 753 00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,840 that you see the follicles? &gt;&gt; MARK: Um... Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS &gt;&gt; MARK: Now, if you look over on this side, you can see that you got lots of what are called follicles. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, is that good that you see the follicles? &gt;&gt; MARK: Uh, absolutely. It's something that could contain an egg. 761 00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:20,038 That means that you could be fine carrying a pregnancy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My results are good. They're positive, but I'm just not at that place right now to get pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is Kylie's party Saturday or Friday? Oh, God. What are you doing down there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Trying to shake my littleout. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're all up in there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It just happens. What do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A lot to handle. By the way, I need to figure out a way to apologize to your mother. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Alcohol. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That would be the way to my heart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just start it off with a glass of wine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that... Is that weird, though? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I think she'll think it's nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to get this wine ready. Hey, does she drink out of these things? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, she likes those glasses. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bet she does. That should be fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Auntie Kris! It's me! I got you a glass of wine after a long day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is, like, a bottle of wine in a glass. What is going on here? What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm here to say sorry. I feel bad that I got rid of the scooter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really appreciate the fact that you're here. Where I have the issue is it was about me wanting to create a family experience, and the fact that you disregarded that hurt 791 00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,875 my feelings, and you lied about it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is there anything that I can do to make up for what I did? You tell me, and I'll try to do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I want to do is spend time with you guys and have adventures and have fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Next scooter event, I will join so you can feel that bond that you speak of. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't we just go, you and I, on a scooter date? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, it's a deal, scooter date, me and you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, scooter date. Even though I was so upset, I still accept Scott's apology. The fact that he came here and knows the way to my heart... I love you, Scott. Just don't lie to me anymore. The biggest glass I've ever seen in my life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Drink up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's gonna take me about three days to get through this wine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, Mom, please. Don't be shy around us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shut theup, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's an Italian greyhound. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is it wearing? It is the ugliest dog I've ever seen, and the fact that you are obsessed with it is so bizarre. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's literally all I want in my life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're too cute to have a dog that looks like that. 815 00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,518 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, they're amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? Hi. Am I what? No, I'm not, Lamar. No. Can I call you when I'm done, please? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is Lamar coming to my party? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, God only knows. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! How does yours not open when you do that? Shake, rattle and roll. He's so annoying right now. Like, go back to basketball. Hello. Something important, and you can't call... You want me to call you there? Holy moley. I mean, there's a lot of emotional issues I think Lamar has. You know, I do want to help or cater to Lamar, but also, there's only so much anybody could take. Hey, so what's going on? What's important? What do you mean, "What's up?" Somebody what? Somebody said I'm there? Okay, well, I'm not. You keep calling me at my mom's, so you know where I am. Right, or did I... I mean, how is that logical? Okay, I know you saying "for real," but that can't be happening, 'cause I'm here. So you could be... I think you're tired. Yeah, I think you're tired. Listen, well, you're bugging just a little bit. Yeah, so I'm here. If you want to call me at my mom's, you know the number. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Where does he think you are? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, Kylie. I can't answer you. Lamar, he is a very depressed person, which is sad but understandable for everything he's been through in his life. And I do love Lamar with every ounce of who I am, but it's really scary when someone's in such a deep low, and you know they're kind of relying on you to get them out, and you're trying and you're trying and you're trying, and nothing's really working. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know really what's going on in your little life there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't really know what goes on either. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The paparazzi are so crazy, and it's really only getting worse. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are they following us? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, you! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Get in the car! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We are setting MJ up on a senior dating site. &gt;&gt; MAN: My body is toned up and my blood pressure's down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Walt. &gt;&gt; MJ: I'm not interested. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have to get my hospital bag. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Typical Kim, she hasn't even packed yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, how do I book a hospital? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You haven't booked a hospital room? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, we haven't.
