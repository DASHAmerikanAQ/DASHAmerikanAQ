- &gt;&gt; ROB: Legitimately, you can gain an inch of your penis if you lose ten pounds. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, Rob. We've heard your story. &gt;&gt; ROB: Also, why I'm gonna do porn. &gt;&gt; KIM: "There are some things that you don't know until you become pregnant with your first child. There are some people who think it's a good idea to eat your own placenta." &gt;&gt; ROB: That's gross. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is what a placenta looks like. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is the sack where the baby lives inside of you. It's all bloody. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Some mothers see health benefits in eating their placentas." mothers? So it's not guaranteed? &gt;&gt; KIM: "The perfect postpartum super food. It helps balance hormones." I feel like I need that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this what happens when everyone gets pregnant? You turn into, like, little Kourtneys? Earth Mother God. Oh, I'm so in tune with myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I'm not turning into Kourtney. I think I just... When you become pregnant, different things change, and your priorities change. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're getting crazy. That... You have such a devious Joker 26 00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:02,548 smile. It's the best. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're always eating. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mmm. I feel like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna eat it off the table? It's that worth it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um... &gt;&gt; KIM: Ugh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, who eats all this candy? It's ridiculous. Look at that. Seriously. Ew. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, 'cause Lamar doesn't throw anything away. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, literally 30 bags of candy. He is out of control. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, within the past year, binge-eats, 'cause he is an emotional eater. And so, you know, it just kind of worries me, 'cause I don't want him to head back down that downward spiral. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm 50 pounds overweight. It's-it's embarrassing to the family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't just let you hide out in your room. That is a sign, to me, of somebody who's depressed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He has to find his way. &gt;&gt; KIM: That candy is not normal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, okay. Kumbaya. You got very, like... Your eyes went beadier than I've ever seen in my life. 52 00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:24,821 That freaked me out a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, look who popped into town and graced us with his presence. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, hey. I called you today. You didn't see? Look what happens, and you don't pick up my calls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, wait, wait, wait. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Come on, bring it in. : Hi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What is your girlfriend's name? My friends know her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is this your girlfriend? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Maybe. Oh, look at him. Oh. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Gets the glasses on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nice &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, she's holding a cat. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, oh, oh, okay. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But she's holding a cat. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That was good. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That was funny. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Mm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, guys, they want Jimmy Fallon. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I thought you hated that guy. &gt;&gt; LEAH: What happened? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I'm in Germany a week before the games, so I'm watching Jimmy Fallon, and he makes some stupid face joke-- I can't blink or something. I don't know. It was stupid. And I'm thinking to myself, "I got to be in the middle of Germany and listen to this?" You know? I mean, most of Jimmy Fallon's jokes have been blink jokes. Okay, Bruce can't blink 'cause he's had so many surgeries. Well, you know what? I can blink, Jimmy Fallon. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Are you gonna kick his ass on national TV? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I did... approach him. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So I put my hand out like I'm gonna shake his hand. I grab his hand, I pull him in tight. I just got right in his face and said, "No moreface jokes." He was so scared. Jimmy Fallon-- he's been beating on me for years. After a while, it's not funny anymore to me. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Pro: Bruce Jenner will be the face of E!'s Olympic coverage. &gt;&gt; STEVE: Wait for it! &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Con: someone else's face will be the face of Bruce Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And why should I get in his playing field, being on his show? I don't need it. I say "no" on Fallon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know what? Bruce said that he saved one of his kids... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...with a... Not the elliptical. What's it called? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, started choking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Stairmaster? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM/SCOTT: Heimlich. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Heimlich. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Elliptical. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. It was so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I grabbed that little sucker, had him down. Bam, bam, bam on his back. Came right up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That looks so good. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Barbecued chicken breasts. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Could have been Burt or maybe Brody or something. One of the boys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sharone, have you ever cooked a placenta? &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Cooked a placenta? Personally, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A placenta? &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, they say you can eat them. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: You do. My wife did that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No way. &gt;&gt; KIM: She did? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ugh! &gt;&gt; SHARONE: It's supposed to be good two ways-- one: help with postpartum, and also, it's great for menopause. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you guys could split it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, would you share with Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just snotted myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's cookbooks of different ways that you have to cook it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I can't. This is just... This is such a beautiful dinner, I just lost my appetite. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why would you not take it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's the question I want to know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, guys... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna eat the stuff that came out of the inside of your body? &gt;&gt; KIM: We definitely want to eat it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, that is the most disgusting thing I've ever heard. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? I think everyone's just being really weird and closed-minded. Except for Kourtney. I mean, she gets it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to have a third child just to eat the placenta. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here we go! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Eat some of Kim's! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I will eat some of Kim's. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, ew! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Eating the placenta is like cannibalism. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So why the hell would you do that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, it looks like Arizona over here. &gt;&gt; ROB: I know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doesn't it? Love the Grand... &gt;&gt; ROB: Look at those people on the mount... on the rocks and &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Shut up. killer, brah. &gt;&gt; ROB: We should come back here, just you and I, have a little day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And put long hair on. So Rob and I decided to go take a look at a car today, and we decided to take the scenic route. I mean, we're in the middle of nowhere. Wait. What is this place? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's... Log... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Log Cabin. &gt;&gt; ROB: We got some Buddha Khloe likes Buddha Just pull in here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pull in? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, just pull in right 156 00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:32,142 here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is wild. Hello. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Scott? &gt;&gt; SHEREE: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott? &gt;&gt; SHEREE: Good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You carve everything with a chain saw? &gt;&gt; SHEREE: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's unbelievable. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, it's pretty crazy. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hi. I'm Robert. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: I'm Sheree. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: Nice to meet you, Robert. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. Scott. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: Hi, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; ROB: Nice. Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you do lessons, as well? &gt;&gt; SHEREE: I do, I do, yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Can you do a Buddha, like that over there? &gt;&gt; SHEREE: I can do anything. Absolutely anything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How long did that take you-- the bench? &gt;&gt; SHEREE: That bench? About a day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? That's unbelievable. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. I do want a Buddha. My... one of my sisters is, like, obsessed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So why don't you do a lesson? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, whatever. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: When you do a lesson, how does that work? &gt;&gt; SHEREE: Well, usually, I teach people how to carve a bear. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A Buddha's probably a little hard for your first carve, right? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. I can't... No. You know, I know Scott thinks that this is, like, a joke, but I love to try new things all the time. Like, how many other opportunities am I gonna get to chainsaw some wood? &gt;&gt; SHEREE: You want to come tomorrow? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, sure. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: We can do a lesson? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, sure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You should get a giant penis carved out. &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He hasn't seen his in a while now that he's gained a little. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm trying to show you these baby room inspirations. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love that brick wall that's painted white. Really cute. I think I'll do, like, a chalkboard on one thing. Wait. I cannot believe how, like, close-minded everyone is in the family about me wanting to eat my placenta. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Especially Bruce. He was, like, freaking out. &gt;&gt; KIM: So annoying. I feel like I want to feed them my placenta, like, without them knowing. And then be like, "Ah, you ate it!" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, you could buy breast milk. Why don't we buy a placenta? "Human placentas sold and eaten." &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone has given me 208 00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:39,274 the hardest time in the past, playing pranks on me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, let's go. We're out of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who TP'd my house? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's just another little spider. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce, don't come close to me with that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get on there! &gt;&gt; KIM: I would just love to get back at them. I just think it would be so funny if we were eating dinner and they ate into something, everyone, and then we were like, "I thought you didn't like placenta." My family should think twice before they give a hormonal pregnant woman a hard time, get them all back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "This is delicious, Kourtney. I didn't know you were such a good cook." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so proud of you, Rob, for, like, trying something new. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh-uh. You know we have neighbors, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm very proud of everyone for trying something new tonight. that they've eaten placenta. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You did not do that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wood-carvin' time, baby! We're back! Hello! We are... ready to carve. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: So you're gonna do a bear today. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, let's do a bear. I know Scott thinks that it's a joke, but I'm kind of just going with the flow. I mean, I'm definitely down to make somelittle bears or whatever. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: I'm gonna teach you how to start a saw. See? This is when it's unlocked. You want it forward. So go ahead now. That should start it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There you go. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: There you go. Cut straight across to that line, and watch inside. There you go. Awesome. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't even need to masturbate anymore-- this thing's a forearm workout. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna do the head. There you go. &gt;&gt; ROB: I-I see it already. 247 00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,196 &gt;&gt; SHEREE: He's actually looking pretty good. He's looking real good. &gt;&gt; ROB: Whew! That's a workout. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: I'm really proud of you. You have the knack for this. &gt;&gt; ROB: I definitely never heard someone tell me that I'm good at chain saw art. I'm obviously not Picasso or anything, but... I'm definitely up there. I mean, is this something that I can do on my own at home? &gt;&gt; SHEREE: Yeah. You made some good cuts that-that I don't see usually. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're hoping to do this at home, too? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; SHEREE: My pleasure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got that, bub? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, let's take your fried chicken cooking skills and put them to good use. Or do you want to make placenta pasta? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, we should just say it's a new... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY:pasta. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's what it is, technically. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And this is what I like to call "placenta." Kim and I decide to marinate some juicy placenta... and cook it up and serve it to everyone for dinner. There. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What you making? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is real placenta. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Excuse me? &gt;&gt; KIM: You can order it online. But you can't tell anyone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who the hell would I tell? &gt;&gt; KIM: The family. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's illegal to... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's illegal?! 275 00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:03,906 Whose is this?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We had it flown in. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys get into some weird Are you both eating this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're eating it, too. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah, okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And so is the whole 281 00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:17,089 family. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm-I'm not eating it. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, it reeks. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Probably never douched. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It needs seasoned salt. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you gonna tell the family this is what you're eating? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: And neither are you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This family has pulled some pretty crazy things on one another, but stuffing placenta down somebody's mouth when they don't know is pretty sick. I mean, that's got to take the 292 00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,621 cake. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Placenta! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God, where have you been? &gt;&gt; ROB: I just got home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know that a chain saw, tarp, like, all this stuff was delivered here for you today? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why is a chain saw delivered here for you today? &gt;&gt; ROB: 'Cause I'm the one who delivered... something to my house that I'm living in. I'm not that dumb to where a chain saw just randomly comes here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't do this today. It's not every day a chain saw gets delivered to your house. I want to ask questions, but you never know when Rob is gonna snap. &gt;&gt; ROB: I bought it to do my new chain saw art thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, go do it by yourself. Bye. I'm not being around you anymore. &gt;&gt; ROB: You don't have to be around me anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. 310 00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,922 &gt;&gt; ROB: You want to come see me chainsaw now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kimmy? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's open! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's me doing a drive-by. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. What is going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can I have the banana if you only got two left? &gt;&gt; KIM: You can have both, if you'd like. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One is good enough. No, the reason I stopped by... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They want me to do this Jimmy Fallon show. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's made so many jokes about my face, it's just, I'm, like, so tired of it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well... But anyway, I don't know if I want to do it, just 'cause I-I don't, like, want to give him the pleasure of having me on his show. &gt;&gt; KIM: Honestly... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And to be honest with you, what the hell do I need him for? &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce, Fallon wasn't the first person to make fun of you and he's not gonna be the last. Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's true. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really, like, it's just a part of their job, I guess. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you don't go on the show, it's gonna make you look like you can't even face him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well... &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. No, I was thinking, if I did do it, you got to go on with a good sense of humor and have fun with it with him. You know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Of course. Or, like... I mean, if I didn't do things based on the things people said about me... When everyone's like, "She has butt implants," like, I did a butt X-ray-- it's funny. You have to have a good sense of humor. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's true. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Every time I see food in this house, I think of Rob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to see the size cereal bowl he uses? And guess what's in this bowl? Filled to the top-- Cinnamon Toast Crunch. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Where is he? I haven't seen him once since I've been here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He has a new hobby. He is doing, like, chain saw art. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Chain saw art? Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. And my window is right here, and he does it right out there. My sisters and I, we've said, "Rob, get some hobbies." But, like, a 7:00 a.m. chain saw going off right where my room is, like, that's not really working for me. I mean, Rob has woken up Lamar a few times from the chain saw. Rob! You just woke Lamar up. Can you not do this a little later? What am I gonna do? It's the first thing he's ever actually, like, immersed himself in. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Well, besides the two refrigerators. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Kourt, don't you house? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know what, I am happy to make Rob happy. This is the first time that Rob's been passionate about something artistic, and I definitely want to be supportive. If he wants to come stay with me, we will be on... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The chain gang? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The chain gang. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's nice of you. 367 00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:33,723 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I will join the chain gang. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is why I can't wear jean shorts. They go so far up my vagina, I can't even deal. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I like how you blame your clothes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Roberto! I'm inviting Rob to lunch today because I want to talk to him about relocating his chain saw art. The bear that you're doing, I think it's great. I mean, you're not done yet. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's pretty good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it's a good job. I'm actually really nervous. I just know I have to pick my wisely. So, I was telling Kourtney about this, and how much you love to do it, and... and Kourtney was so excited and she was so happy that you have this hobby. So I really think that maybe you 383 00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:40,175 should... do it at Kourt's house. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. Cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob... oddly, took this incredibly well. Kourt, you said you wanted Rob to move his hobby to your house. May the Force be with you. Well, what's going on with you right now? &gt;&gt; ROB: Nothing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you a little sad-ula? &gt;&gt; ROB: Am I? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, you seem a little down. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm actually not down at all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. What were you doing earlier? &gt;&gt; ROB: Running around in my room. I don't like to leave-leave that room. 397 00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:22,964 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you think that's healthy? &gt;&gt; ROB: Get out of here with that &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do not think it's a big deal to ask your brother, "How are you? Are you sad?" May I help you? &gt;&gt; ROB: You don't get to say what's wrong with me when nothing was wrong with me. I wasn't sad; I felt great. And I had a great whole day today. Until you always... you always say something. Don't you notice that? You're the one that always does something. About how I'm, like, a loser and how I rely on everybody and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never called you a loser one time. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes, you do. You're the one who does this. That's why you don't accept it, okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have no idea how me asking how his feelings are turned into the anger and aggression in his voice. Enough is enough. It's all my fault-- that's fine. I got to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just got an e-mail confirming your appearance on Jimmy Fallon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Knowing Bruce, he'll just fly off the handle at Jimmy Fallon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can take this guy on and hold my own. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a little tough. : Oh! What is this? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Is it, like, a strip? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Brisket. 424 00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:40,131 &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. Ready? Turn around once. One more time. Around. Turn around! Go. Good dog. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I ask you a question? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sure! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just got an e-mail... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...confirming your Jimmy Fallon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I-I just decided to do it. I can take this guy on and hold my own. Don't worry. Well, if I'm gonna do this show, I'm thinking, if I could go on there and kind of control the whole interview and take some potshots at Jimmy Fallon, might be fun. It would be fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just worry that you could be a loose cannon. I don't trust Bruce right now. Knowing Bruce, he'll just fly in and fly off the handle at Jimmy Fallon. I don't want you to do anything that would embarrass us. you? I'm not worried about the rest of the family. I'm fine. I think I can handle Jimmy Fallon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just that I don't know if Jimmy Fallon can handle you. 448 00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:52,191 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Never. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Now, be careful out there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A chain saw's obviously really terrifying to have around the house with children. &gt;&gt; ROB: And just-just to be safe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But Rob learned how to do chain saw art safely, so I am all about it. A little scary. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's really easy though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so proud of you, Rob, for, like, trying 460 00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:45,460 something new. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh-uh. I don't work much, but when I do, it's important, and I need to get things taken care of. And I got Rob carving wood with chain saws right outside the office. I can't work in this kind of environment. You know we have neighbors, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't hear you. What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You'd be interested in this noise? If it was coming from next door? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is my brother, and this is his new hobby that he's into. And he has a passion, and I'm gonna support it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Chain saw in a home. That's normal. Oh, yeah, you keep being supportive until one of your hands gets cut off. &gt;&gt; ROB: What you think? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think it's pretty awesome. &gt;&gt; ROB: Chips me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Chip-chop. I think I have a little piece of sawdust in my eyeball. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: What's up, guys? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. How you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Chilling. What's up, Scott? How you doing, my man? Good to see you. Hi, Kourt. I'm nervous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: About the placenta? &gt;&gt; SHARONE: What's the word here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tonight is our beautiful placenta dinner, and we have brought in a chef to help us prepare this lovely meal and help dress the placenta so nobody knows what we're up to. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: What animal is this placenta from, just FYI? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A human. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: A hu... What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes, that's the disgusting part. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Oh, my God. I'm gonna put it in the oven just to make sure I kill any bacteria that's in there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Am I the best sous-chef you've ever had? &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Rock and roll. 494 00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:19,816 Open me up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Placenta coming in! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, how are you? &gt;&gt; SHARONE: It's been a minute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it gonna be one delicious meal? &gt;&gt; SHARONE: What do you feel like, placenta? &gt;&gt; KIM: Placenta. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's up? &gt;&gt; SHARONE: What's up, bud? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's going on? Something smells really good in here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So what are we having for dinner? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're having some tasty protein. This is gonna be a divine meal. It's not that often that I cook, as you all know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're not cooking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I assisted. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You turned the stove on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't we all sit down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Hey, Kourt, I'm ready when you are, if you want to pull it out. 512 00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:05,508 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where should I sit? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wherever you want. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I see it? Good, there is so much flavor on it, they'll have no idea. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Should we put some of this yummy sauce on top, too? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here, guys. This is the grand finale. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God, that looks amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is it a brisket? &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Do you want me to cut you guys a piece? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it's nice and tender. That knife just melts right through. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Who's gonna have the first taste? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wish I could say that I'd like to warn everybody that they're about to embark on a placenta marathon, but the truth is, everybody in this room has probably done something to me at one point. So I can't wait for them to eat up. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm starving. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is this? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Is it, like, a strip? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Brisket. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you really not gonna eat the meat that I slaved over? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, the one thing she actually cooked. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I actually made that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It just smells kind of... crazy. It's a little tough. : Oh! Maybe you didn't marinate it long enough. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't judge until you try it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's really good, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you having some, Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just gonna have a little salad tonight. Take it easy. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I mean, it's really seasoned deliciously, but I think it might've been a little bit overcooked. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm very proud of everyone for trying something new tonight. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I guess you guys really didn't like the way placenta tastes. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You did not do that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone is dying that they've eaten placenta, and it's just so satisfying to just play a joke like this. 551 00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,220 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That was really placenta? Here I am. Jimmy Fallon. I got a secret weapon. Dunham. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Jenner. What's up? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Jeff is a professional comedian, and we come up with some material. &gt;&gt; JEFF: If it doesn't go well, I had nothing to do with this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you know where the wood bear is? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I kind of have a confession. I took it and I threw it over the fence. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is wrong with you? 563 00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:25,356 How are we gonna explain it to Rob? &gt;&gt; KIM: So I guess you guys really didn't like the way placenta tastes. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You guys are sick. That was really placenta? &gt;&gt; KIM: We ordered it from the Internet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: From Brazil. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a stranger's placenta? No. Oh, God, please. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone took a bite. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I think I'm gonna throw up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited that Kourtney and I have pulled off this placenta joke. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so healthy for you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So's going to the gym. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. Kimberly! 577 00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,805 You guys are just sick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Yeah, how was Leno? All right, I'll call you back. Bye. That's cool. Does he have a name? &gt;&gt; ROB: Cornelius. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's a good name. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think I'm still gonna keep working at it and keep doing the whole chain saw thing. It's not like a big grizzly bear, but it's like a bear I chainsawed or whatever, so that's cool to me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where... shall we put him? &gt;&gt; ROB: Wherever your heart desires. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bears like to be outside. &gt;&gt; ROB: They do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. Come here. I have the perfect spot for Cornelius. In the middle. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, whatever. That's fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like him. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, looks good, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks, Rob. I get your first masterpiece. &gt;&gt; ROB: Obviously, I'm gonna give it to you 'cause you're the only one who actually appreciates it, so... it's all good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do appreciate it. &gt;&gt; MAN: You good? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I got it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now that I've decided hey, I'm excited. Dunham. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Jenner! What's up? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got a secret weapon: my good buddy, Jeff Dunham. &gt;&gt; JEFF: I'm kidding, I know. I married a petite young beautiful thing. Yeah, she was literally eaten by the woman I live with now. : Hey, hey, hey! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Jeff is a professional comedian, and we've worked on some good material. I'm just getting ready to get changed. I'm getting ready for big Jimmy here. Hey, I want to thank you for the material. Uh, I think I got it down. I'm ready to go. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Well, good. And if it doesn't go well, I had nothing to do with this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doll? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How weird is this picture on your blog of this photographer behind you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's pretty awesome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yo, yo. What's happening? I need to borrow that bear. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to borrow Cornelius? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I need Cornelius. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I actually see one of Cornelius's crumbs on my counter right now. What do you want to borrow him for? &gt;&gt; ROB: Show him to Lamar. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're running out to dinner, so... can I get it to you tomorrow? 629 00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:46,551 &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, whenever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Love you. Where's the piece of wood? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. Ay, yi, yi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you know where the wood bear is? &gt;&gt; KIM: In the entry, where you guys put it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did the gardeners come today? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I think so. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I kind of have a confession that I need to tell you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That silly wood sculpture thing bear... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...that I saw in the middle of the hallway when you walk in... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...was so disgusting and ruined that whole vibe... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it didn't. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You think I want to walk home to Smokey the Bear every night? So I took it and I threw it over the fence... and I-I guess it landed in one of those garbage bins, so when the gardeners came, they took it away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that a joke? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, no, I just put it there just to get it out of the way. I didn't think they were going... to take it away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, what would you expect? What is wrong with you? That is so rude and disrespectful. How are we gonna explain it to Rob? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know what to tell you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You better figure it out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my Lord. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm on my way to do Jimmy Fallon. The last time I met him, I was in his face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you just not create any craziness. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We sent out your bear to get it stained and, 662 00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:29,351 like, they sent me back this. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's not the bear. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think it's safe? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Those shoes are good for bear building. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I-I don't have, like, bear-building shoes. I don't know what you want. Something happened to Rob's pride and joy, the bear that he's carving out of this log. Does anyone have a picture of what Rob did? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to see it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, yeah, if we have to copy it. We'll never be able to pull this thing off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was a Flugenheimen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What theis a Flugenheimen? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a Flugenheimen! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, I hate the so shut the up! It literally gives me chills. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my Flugey! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay? I hate it. this thing. Here. I mean... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Don't. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know how to use this stupid thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing?! Scott! You're not making... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're gonna get wood chips in your eyes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, us three have no idea. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Obviously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why can't we look online, and let's get it overnighted. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's a great idea-- 'cause this isn't going anywhere. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at the comparisons. This is Rob's. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He could think that we fluffed his up a little. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I swear, they look pretty good. Just change the nose and still say we fluffed it up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think that's fine. You know he's a little delusional sometimes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, guys. So let's order this one. 696 00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:53,260 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Funkadubious! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Those little city bikes seem to be working out pretty good. &gt;&gt; CABDRIVER: Yup. My wife rides almost every day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CABDRIVER: I got a wife that stays fit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, you got a wife that stays fit, yeah, yeah. Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, babe. Jimmy Fallon. It'll be interesting to see what happens. The last time I met him, I was in his face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That'll be really bad if you do that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. Yeah, but he deserves it. Um, anyway... &gt;&gt; KRIS: He doesn't deserve anything-- he's a great guy, and you should just relax and have a good time and don't be nervous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not nervous. Now, Kris is worried. It seems like I got everybody nervous. Usually a day or two before you do any of these shows, they got a producer call, he goes over the questions and this and that. That's not what I really want to talk about. To be honest with you, I'm really not interested in Jimmy Fallon's questions. I got a lot of material. I'm ready to go with this guy. I-I will control the interview. So now I got the producer all upset with me 'cause I'm not telling him what's going on. Jimmy Fallon has no idea what's going on. I got him right where I want him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you just not create any craziness, and go have fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I got to create a little craziness. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Make love, not war. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to see the things I got framed? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The girl just putting one leg up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's kind of interesting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're going in my bathroom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's cool though. What's in here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me get a ka-nife. That's our bear. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know how light this feels? Wasn't the other bear, like, big? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the box the bear comes in. Look how small that is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The other one, you couldn't even pick up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Watch out. Where is the... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is this for? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What?! Rob's was this big. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's, like, the other one took a dump. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. Rob is going tohimself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He may not even remember. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Has anyone known Rob recently, like, to know about the major spaz attacks that happen? Like, if we were to show him this, he might throw this at our car. You guys, this is bad. This bear is what the other bear could have birthed. This is definitely not gonna work. We're gonna have to tell Rob the truth. Ours is half pig, half bear. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We could say, they must have sent ours to somebody else, and now we can't get that back, 'cause obviously ours is better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob is going to spaz theout. Here you go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Obviously, you can't show him this. This is like a medallion. 761 00:35:41,378 --> 00:35:44,248 It's like I got a midget hanging from my necklace. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. So my biggest thing with Rob is... I know you said when he comes, we'll just, like, tell him that we've sent it... Like, are you making up...? What are...? Like, what truth? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're telling him the new truth. Just follow my lead, old chap. Look at that cool chair to see the view. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. That's like a lifeguard chair. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you just save all of these magazines for what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For inspiration. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, guys. I made you this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, that was nice. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's a Buddha. I thought Khloe would like it, so you guys can share it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you see I displayed your bear? &gt;&gt; ROB: Is that really...? That's not the bear. I actually thought it was supposed to be. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I would like it if you did think I was serious. We sent out your bear-- remember I told you-- to get it stained, and, like, they sent me back this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here it is-- Jimmy Fallon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God, here we go. It's not funny. I'm mortified over this, and I'm embarrassed for him. What is he doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you see I 788 00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,560 displayed your bear? &gt;&gt; ROB: That's not the bear. Yeah, what happened? You broke it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not tripping out that we got the wrong bear? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, 'cause I could care less about a bear and some wood. Not that serious. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I'm glad that you feel that way. I just thought that you were gonna be really attached to that bear. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's just... I don't care. It's just a bear. I just don't like how you guys always think, like, something's always wrong, or that you think I'm gonna, like, snap or whatever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sorry. I misunderstood. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're all good. It's kind of ridiculous that my sisters-- they always are so babying with everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, I'm only saying this because we love you. And I found a huge plastic bag filled with all these empty candy wrappers, and I know that I'm an emotional eater. I want to make sure that you're okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm always good. You just... I don't know if you're trying to see some type of emotion out of me. I don't really show emotion like that. And the only reason I'm living with you is 'cause of your husband, who asked me to. And I clearly just need to get out now. Not 'cause of anything that's wrong. Just 'cause I need to do me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob seems to have calmed down, and it looks like we've dodged the bullet with the bear, but honestly I feel like he's a ticking time bomb. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around him. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mase? &gt;&gt; MASON: Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where are we going? &gt;&gt; MASON: Oh! &gt;&gt; ROB: Just give me a hug. &gt;&gt; MASON: Ah. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I tell you what Mom told me one time when I was dating someone who Mom hooked me up with? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hell, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was like, "He's not calling me back." And she was like, "Well, have you slept with him?" I go, "No." She's like, "Well, have you given him a? And I go, "No." And she goes, "Well, that's why he's not calling you." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nobody calls anybody back without a BJ. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's horrible. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom is so irritated, she does not want to be around us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are lucky I'm even here after that placenta you fed me the last time. Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love that my mom is still bitching about her placenta dinner when the truth is that we really didn't serve them placenta. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew. Look at that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Right here. Can we get that beef brisket flat cut? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; CLERK: Thank you very much for dropping by. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Oh, that's a bloody placenta. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It really is brisket. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know that everyone is going to eventually find out that they weren't eating placenta, but the longer they think they've eaten placenta, the better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nobody wants to eat their innards. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wasn't... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What does an innard mean? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It means in your body. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's insides of your body. We don't want to eat innards. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not a real word-- innard? Sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can we play Scrabble? Jimmy from last night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Okay, let's watch Bruce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Jimmy Fallon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Bruce Jenner is here, and I can't wait to talk to him. I've not met him backstage. I haven't talked to him since London, so... And he refused to come out of his dressing room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is embarrassing. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Swear, he won't come out of his dressing room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For Bruce to refuse to open the door... Like, that's rude. And now my heart's beating fast, my head is spinning. I'm thinking, "What is going on?" And I'm on the other side of the United States. I can't control this one. I don't got this one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Bruce Jenner is here, and he refused to come out of his dressing room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is embarrassing. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Can't wait to talk to him. I've not met him backstage. I haven't talked to him since London. Bruce Jenner, everybody! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce looks so good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He does? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Bruce Jenner, thank... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: First of all, I want to start off. I just want to thank you for finally having me on the show... &gt;&gt; JIMMY:That's such a backhanded way of saying thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And now can I rip you apart? &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Yes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay? Where do we start? &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is he doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The old face jokes, you know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God, here we go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You wind up taking the absolute worst picture of me. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Two can play that game. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: I-I haven't said a word yet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't worry. I got the whole segment covered. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Okay, go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, I thought we'd get really in deep on this. Here we go. Yeah, there we go right there. Look at that outfit right there. We got another one. Okay, next! Here's the next one. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Oh, all right. All right, I was hot. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, in tight there, in tight there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, it is, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He doesn't let him get a word in edgewise. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't let us talk ever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Two can play that game. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: I-I got you. I will take that... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I, like... I'm a little bit mortified over this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's probably excited to talk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think, for 24 years, he's only said about five words. He probably was so excited to do this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was thinking that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: I just want to say, thank you so much. Can we be friends? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I thought it was really good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it's so good, and good for Bruce for standing up for himself. Like, it's funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. You're just too hard on him. He's so funny and good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Feel like he had an epiphany somewhere because Bruce has, like, slowly growing back these testicles. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, he gets ballsy by the sec... Like, the things he'll say. Good for him, and now Jimmy Fallon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, if you really don't think that he embarrassed himself... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I think it's funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...then that makes me at least feel better. The bottom line is, I obviously want the best for Bruce. I mean, Kourtney and Khloe thought he was hysterical, so maybe I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Eat this and shut your face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Ew! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would not eat anything that you give me ever again. I'm taking my salad, and I'm going. See you later. I'll tell Bruce you loved his performance. 'Cause it was a performance! Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I'm Bruce. You may remember me from the Olympic games. Never in a million years did I think I'd be recreating a sex tape of Bruce and Kris Jenner. Oh, God! Oh, yeah! Getting dilated! Oh, boy! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, come on, come on. It's just not funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at Dad. So upset I don't remember this. My memory-- it's getting worse and worse, which is scary. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: What happened at 13? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I remember our dad was on O.J.'s side, and my mom was on Nicole's side. I was too young to understand, like, why someone would be accused of doing that.
