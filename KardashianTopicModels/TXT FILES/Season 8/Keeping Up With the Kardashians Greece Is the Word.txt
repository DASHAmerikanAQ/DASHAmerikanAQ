- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at Bernard. He wants attention. Look. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ugh, I have salad dressing all over my shirt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me clean off your shirt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's not gonna get cleaned. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I don't want a wet shirt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna clean your shirt, come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would rather have a dirty shirt than a wet shirt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me clean your shirt. Look, please? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want a wet shirt. You're such a freak. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's my job to clean. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew, Mom, that has chemicals all over it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you guys get out of my house? Like, get out. This is the most ridiculous... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're so annoying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, clean your shirt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, can you take Mom and put her in the closet? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm cleaning your shirt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, help me! Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Clean your shirt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! Don't do that to Kourtney! That's our favorite sister! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Put her in the closet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Youup everything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's in this box? Aloe juice with pulp? 27 00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,308 me sideways. What's in here? That's disgusting. Have you tried some of these drinks she has? It ain't right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, we're gonna have a surprise birthday dinner for Kourtney in Malibu. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: At Tony's. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At Tony's. Scott's gonna take her with the kids or whatever, and we're all gonna be there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney's birthday is coming up, and I want to try to surprise her, have everybody that she loves there, and I figure Khloe would be a good person to help me get everything together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, let's make a list on who is coming. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's always the same people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need a head count. Don't be a dick. Lamar, Khloe, Robert, that's my family. &gt;&gt; KIM: My family. Me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Keeks. Keeks and them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And the fetus. 47 00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,758 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kim and fetus. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Keeks and the Kimbryo. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, Rob's getting his chain off? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, the chain. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Whoa. Wow. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Chain's coming off. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go, Jenner! &gt;&gt; ROB: No! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Rob. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's nice to be able to have a relationship with Rob again, 'cause I feel like he's got a lot of girls around him. So, it's nice to be able to bond with him and have him actually talk to a guy. Are you working on your fitness? &gt;&gt; ROB: I won't even lift up my shirt; I'm that embarrassed. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You got to own it. Just own it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Not yet. No, that doesn't look good on me. I'm so insecure with my weight and, I don't even want to go anywhere. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Once you get in the routine, you start doing it, you're gonna feel really good, dude. We'll just go out and just do fun stuff. We'll go do, you know, active, fun, cool stuff. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who's gonna be the best girl in the family? 70 00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,989 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Me. I'm the boss bitch in town. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I'm officially ready to retire heels. My feet, they are, like, humongous. Look at that. No shoes will fit around them right now-- wedges. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, you look so swollen. How do you feel? Uncomfortable? &gt;&gt; KIM: Not yet. I don't feel uncomfortable yet. But you know what's weird? I wonder what this is from? Like, do you know when people get that line? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That line. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I'm kind of starting to get it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, you are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You put oil on it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I mean, it goes away, but what is it from? I need to Google it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does your get bigger? Like, am I gonna get bigger camel toe, 'cause that's gonna be scary. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-mmm, that hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, you guys! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, this is exciting. I researched at the Chamber of Tourism of Greece, you guys, trying to decide where we were gonna go on our family vacation, and listen to this: "Dear members of the Kardashian-Jenner family, we're thrilled to invite you to your newest adventure in Greece. Get ready to surround yourself in the bluest blue of the Mediterranean and live like the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus." &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to live like a goddess. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to be a god. &gt;&gt; ROB: I want to be Caesar. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It doesn't get any better than this. &gt;&gt; ROB: If I could be anyone, I would want to be Caesar. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "We are anxiously awaiting your arrival. With warm regards, Hellenic-American Chamber of Tourism. Have fun and come to Greece." What do you think? I say we go to Greece. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've never been. I heard it is so gorgeous and so amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: None of us have ever been, so this is a vacation that we can all experience for the first time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's go. Let's go to Greece. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm down. &gt;&gt; ROB: Toga! &gt;&gt; ALL: Toga! 112 00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,101 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ALL: Toga! Toga! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's up, bro man? &gt;&gt; BRODY: What is? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: How you doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: You two look like surfer brothers. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Do we? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, you guys are like surfer bros. &gt;&gt; BRODY: We need to get out there; we got to get him in the water. &gt;&gt; ROB: What's up? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's up, bro? How you doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: Good. We were talking about working out and &gt;&gt; BRODY: He's scared to go to Malibu just to go hang out. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: They'll harpoon his ass right now. &gt;&gt; ROB: Me? 127 00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,232 &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What theare you looking at? &gt;&gt; ROB: My mom just e-mailed me about this Greece trip that we're all going on and resort and stuff. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Damn, that place looks insane. Who's going on the trip? &gt;&gt; ROB: I think it's a Kardashian-Jenner collabo. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That I heard nothing about? &gt;&gt; ROB: Bruiser should've told you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't get invited on the family trips. &gt;&gt; ROB: Brandon and Leah are coming, so I know you're invited. Probably you just haven't got the memo yet. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What do you mean, Brandon and Leah are invited? &gt;&gt; ROB: Brandon and Leah... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why haven't I heard any about, like, they haven't told me anything about it? &gt;&gt; ROB: Maybe... I swear, I just got the e-mail now. Things are probably... You know, I'm, like, the last one to know about all these things. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm used to not getting invited on the family trips. I pretty much expect it, but then to hear that everybody else was going and I wasn't included, it upset me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yo. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo, Bruiser Doozer. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Robster, I haven't heard from you in a while. &gt;&gt; ROB: I know, I've been doing push-ups. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How's it going? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I've been, uh, helping him with it, though. This is your other son Brody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom sent me an e-mail that we're going on this Greece trip. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Where was my invite? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, Bro, I thought for sure you had known about this. Let me talk to Kris. I'll see what the heck's going on. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, I'm not going unless Brody goes. Him and I are both single. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's just what we need, morepush-ups. &gt;&gt; ROB: There you go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you hiding? All the way back in your closet? I was just talking to Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I'm a little upset 'cause Brody, um, wasn't invited to Greece? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't this a cute bra? It's like a great color, right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fabulous bra. You know, I'm trying to reconnect with the guy. I mean, it's a family trip. He is part of the family. He should be invited. I mean, come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what, it's not about not including him. It's just about every time I do include him, he is busy or he flakes or he doesn't want to come. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I invited Brandon and Leah. They're so excited about coming, and I know they would be thrilled if Brody would go, but I always feel like Brody's so busy that he doesn't have time for us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob doesn't even want to go 'cause he would be the only single guy there. He needs, like, somebody to go, like, I guess party. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Single guy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And Brody's a professional at that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I'm not sure if he's gonna even respond to my invitation. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your job is to invite him. If he doesn't respond, he doesn't respond. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's not exactly the easiest person to reach out to. I mean, I'm open to having a relationship with Brody, but it's got to be natural. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then Greece is a perfect place to talk to him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, so, let's get it done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll try to make it happen, but it's gonna be tough with the flights. I'll see what I can do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We can figure out 195 00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,337 the flights. Let's just make sure he goes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, I smell it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cakes, are you getting horny? &gt;&gt; KIM: A little bit. I wish I didn't eat. I just had, like, three Dibs, a string cheese and a handful of those, uh, vegetable chips. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's, like, not normal. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, almost had a nervous breakdown today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: The paparazzi is really driving me crazy-- I know it's kind of annoying to talk about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was like, "Why are they all out here?" &gt;&gt; KIM: My attorney just wrote me and says, "Hey, um, you know 208 00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,574 you and Kris have a mandatory court date." &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe in, like, a week, I have to be in court with him. My divorce has been going on for a year and a half, and the judge has finally set a trial date. Any time you go to court, it's obviously stressful. I might make you guys testify. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Me? Don't involve me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I would like to take you to dinner tomorrow night, just me and you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to go to lunch or do a dinner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying to plan this party. All I want to do is surprise her and take her to Tony's. I don't know if this is gonna happen. &gt;&gt; KIM: Today is the day that Kris and I are going to court. My stomach is turning, and my heart is just pumping with nerves. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been trying to reach out to you, and you don't even respond. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I wouldn't blatantly ignore you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's, like, this awkward energy between my mom and Brody. There's just some unfinished 229 00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,229 business between the two. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm done. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks. Isn't it funny to think that, like, little old grandmas that can barely walk could have been, like, real big whores at one time? It's weird to think. Like, some little old lady, 30, 40 years ago, she was everything she could find in sight in college, high school, who knows? You're telling me there wasn't trains being ran on people back then? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We never talked about my birthday. I mean, I like to do fun things for birthdays. Like, I don't want to go to lunch or do a dinner. Like, I'd rather have a bowling party. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I would like to take you to dinner tomorrow night, just me and you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'd love to go to dinner on my birthday. I'm just saying... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It kind of just sounded like you didn't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, 'cause I was planning to take you to Tony's, 'cause it's, like, your favorite restaurant, and I just felt like you always like going there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love Tony's. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So do I, and it's fun. I felt like it's a good pre-game to get a little Greek food in us before we go to Greece. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Or since we're going to Greece, would we rather go to Nobu, 'cause we're gonna eat Greek food for a week? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying to plan this party. All I want to do is surprise her and take her to Tony's, which she claims is her favorite restaurant. Now she wants to eat Japanese. Kourtney is making me crazy. I don't know if this is gonna happen. I feel like we have good memories at Tony's, and I don't know, I just thought that's kind of, like, your favorite restaurant in Malibu. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is definitely my favorite restaurant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I made a reservation 264 00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,342 there, so we'll see. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think so. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is going on here? Your little crop top? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I'll probably get brutalized in the press for it. Being like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: "She's showing her stomach," but what can you do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just met up with my attorney, and I'm really excited to share all the updates that's been going on with my divorce. So, of course, Kris doesn't want to get on a plane. So he sent over... I mean, he has playoffs and stuff, but... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But didn't he say publicly he'll miss the playoff games? &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. So he sent over a settlement today. He's finally, for the first time, said he will agree to a divorce, and, um, I want one Skype phone call with him. I want a one-on-one conversation with him. I honestly can't believe that it's been almost two years, and I'm finally getting a divorce, but I don't want to, like, jinx myself and get too excited until all the papers are, like, signed, sealed and delivered. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Will you just tell me your passion for wanting to have a conversation with him? I don't... Just so you can have closure? &gt;&gt; KIM: It really bothers me that he really feels, in his heart, that I didn't love him. There are things that I would own up to and say, "You know what, I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry if you felt like we should've communicated better in our filing for a divorce." I wish I did that differently. I really do, and I want to apologize for that, but it still doesn't mean that I don't have a conscience and have a heart that I would want him to know how I really feel. I wouldn't want someone to really believe the hype. 296 00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,915 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, ladies. We're out of here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: These kids were over here this weekend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And it's like nobody cleans up after themselves. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, this is from today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is today's mess? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is a re-mess. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who was out here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall and her friends. So, um, I just wanted you to know that I got the flights for Brody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, yeah, but he has to go early. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's the only flight I could get. I'm trying, but I actually got Leah and Brandon to go early from here. Those guys will all meet, and he won't be alone. So I've tried to think of everything, and just, like, I'm not the evil step-monster that you guys think I am, okay? I have never been given any credit for anything I've ever tried to do for those kids... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, honey... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and I just want a little bit of credit for trying to do the right thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I give you credit. I give you credit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's great that Kris booked the ticket to get Brody to go to Greece. It's important that, you know, we're gonna spend a week together all stuck on an island, talking and communicating, and hopefully bonding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Call him and talk about it, and then you guys can figure out what you're gonna do and all the toys you're gonna play on 326 00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:58,364 and all the Jet Skis. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris and I are going to court. We're supposed to finalize the divorce papers and sign everything. Hi. &gt;&gt; LAWYER: Hi. Are you close? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, we are about to pull in. &gt;&gt; LAWYER: Oh, perfect. I'll meet you down there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Even though we've come up with an agreement, the judge will still need to sign the paperwork. If the judge doesn't sign off, then it could be, you know, four to six months waiting in the system. So, unfortunately, I could still be married to Kris while I'm having, you know, my baby. Right here. Hopefully, this is the last step to this chapter in my life. I'm just gonna wait for my attorney. And we can both move on 343 00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,557 with our lives. Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The chances of her getting divorced today and having a judge, like, declare her divorce are slim to none. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But the fact that she's in there for this long means that something's percolating. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney is still at home. Like, Scott's one job was to get her here. It's an hour past the time Scott picked for us to be here. I just think that's so rude of Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, he's just a douche. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, it's so cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, a lot of people, like, paint these, and then they auction them off at the Elephant Parade. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then the money goes to, um, protecting, like, elephants in the wild. It goes to all the charity. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Mission of the Elephant Parade is to become the world's largest financial support organization for the Asian elephant." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do a lot of stuff with animals, FYI. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe my phone doesn't ring. It's just, like, it's been hours since she went in there. She hasn't called us, and she hasn't texted me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It takes a while, though. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The chances of her getting divorced today and having a judge, like, declare her divorce are slim to none. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But the fact that she's in there for this long means that something's percolating, and I just want her to, you know, be okay and to have this over. Should I drive down to the courthouse? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's fine. That's so, like "embarrassantĂŠ." "Oh, my mom has to come into the courtroom, Judge. Is that okay?" You got to relax a little. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't relax anymore. It's just, it goes on and on. Love you, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you, too, sicko. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm officially divorced. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, good for you! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you believe the judge was, like, "All right, I'll take you across and I'll swear you in, like, under, you know, under oath." And I just stand up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I had to, like, go up at the front. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is such an exciting day! Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I'm so happy, Kimmy. I'm so happy! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I'm really excited. The judge granted me my divorce. I had no idea that he would really do it. And I'm very excited just to move on with this chapter in my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you call K? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I haven't yet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, you have to. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're the first person I'm calling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw... I've been praying about it all morning. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it was, like, a long shot the judge was gonna see me and-and actually do it. And he did it. So he, um, you know... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh! Congratulations. 401 00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:00,139 : Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, sprinkle some there. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You all right? 405 00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,751 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah... mwah! Mwah! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Give me a kiss. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The Brodester! Hey, it's Lamar's best friend! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at the cake. &gt;&gt; KIM: Guys, guys, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shh! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. I have a quick announcement before Kourt gets here 'cause I don't want to, um, make this about anyone else. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're pregnant. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, I'm pregnant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ah! &gt;&gt; KIM: But Kris and I are officially divorced. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Congratulation! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you believe Rob just said, "I don't want to come"? He's really insecure about his weight. We're allinsecure about our weight. Like, get over it. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Mwah! &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'll do one shot. Bruce is about to do a shot. Cheers. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Gotta do the whole thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I will, but... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's bad luck. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, is it bad luck? &gt;&gt; LAMAR:There you go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney is still at home. Will you call Scott and say, "What theare you guys?" How are you...? Scott hasn't done one thing. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's pretty hard to keep a secret like that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're just going to have another shot, because they're late. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, hey! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, let's move it and groove it, babe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't really like the lime. Do you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not about the lime sparkling. It's about you getting ready so we can go to your birthday dinner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You literally never told me a time when. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, don't play with my like that, baby girl. Not on your birthday, not any day. Let's go! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are we going to Tony's or Nobu? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're going to Tony's! You know, I'm trying to get Kourtney out the door, and everybody keeps calling me, asking me, "When are you leaving?" And it's not my fault that Kourtney is moving as slow as a newborn child right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nobu's your favorite restaurant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's no reservations left at Nobu tonight. It's busy. 451 00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,398 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sure we can walk in. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: We got Pop two shots. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, he didn't, really. Did he take it? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Ah, I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Where is he? He have one over there right now? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yep. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom. Dad's letting me take a shot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop. No, no, no, no! Bruce! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Babe! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are so full of &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The water's a shocker. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it was water. Why don't we all sit down and save a place for Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney is still at home. Like, Scott's one job was to get her here. It's an hour past the time Scott picked for us to be here. I don't want our family and friends to start leaving. I just think that's so rude of Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Well, he's just a douche. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Looks like we're here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Greece. I'm beyond excited to be here in Greece. And this place is absolutely gorgeous. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Greece, baby! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just got an e-mail saying Rob is not coming to Greece. 474 00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,267 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is such an excuse. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Look at all this food, and the birthday girl is not even here yet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's a little late. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: One more, bro. Just one more. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce is doing shots for real? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Let's go on to the finish line, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Here we go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's enough for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are these shots? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't! No, Kim! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love that, with all of us, not one person knew she was walking in the door. And Scott, like, couldn't tell us that you were, like, five minutes away? Hello, dodo bird. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey! I am so surprised that everyone planned this party for little old me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Were you surprised? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah! I was so surprised. 492 00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,724 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yay! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow, that's some serious water. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm ready, bro. Here we go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Take that shot. How's that shot? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Cheers, sis. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whose idea was this fiesta? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was, like, a joint venture. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I cannot believe that I didn't realize that this was happening. Like, no one has ever given me a surprise party that I haven't found out about. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: They got the video of you with the candy in the tub! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you kidding? What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What happened? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar was on an adult site. And he went to where it says, like, "Celebrity videos." And that stupid candy video that I made for him is on the Web site. Uh! The fact that it's on a porn site is sick and gross. Ugh! You had such a good game tonight. Yeah, I want you to come home with me and play around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna make a candy video. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is disgusting. 515 00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,822 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, Monica, I love this necklace. &gt;&gt; MONICA: Which one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: With the orange balls. &gt;&gt; MONICA: You like balls? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I bit my mouth. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am going to pack. Khloe and Monica are over helping me pack for Greece, because, you know, I like to travel in style. Are you coming to London? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would I go to London? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just for a day, to break up the trip. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? How boring. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because with the kids, we were supposed to fly to London at seven-and-a-half hours, then we were gonna have a four-and-a-half hour layover and staying the night. And then a three-and-a-half- hour flight to Athens. And then an hour flight to Mykonos. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so good. How annoying does that sound? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. The whole thing is crazy. To break up the trip, Scott and I decided to stop in London with my mom. Scott has to do an appearance out there, and then he's gonna meet up with us in, like, two days. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See? And you guys could have gone to Cabo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm excited. We get to see the world. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I go to Cabo every other week, guys. I can't do this again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: YOLO. YOLO. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so excited to go to Greece. The only thing I'm sad about is that Lammy can't come because 544 00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,132 he is currently in basketball season. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. We're here in London, we're gonna get some shopping in. We're gonna be well-rested. The kids are gonna be happy. And tomorrow we're going to Greece, baby. I got it, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't this a cute place? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Look at these little dolls, Mom. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: They all have their own individual-designed outfits. And they have underwear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't even wear underwear. Rob. I just got an e-mail... saying that he's not coming... to Greece. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I don't know what to do. I just feel really bad that he's missing out on this amazing family vacation. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why would he not come? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He says he's just gonna throw himself into his work and he's got too many things to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Didn't we have this cleared and planned for ages? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. And he decided that all of a sudden his sock business is booming and he can't pull himself away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is such an excuse. Rob is saying that he can't come because of things that are booked for his sock line, but my mom said he has nothing purposely booked because we were supposed to be on vacation. And it makes me mad that he's just gonna stay back in L.A. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's on my list. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just annoying. &gt;&gt; ROB: Within the next six months, if I don't get some... this together, then I won't want to, like, hang around everybody. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's all right if it's something bigger. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not, like, depressed, but... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Being depressed is not being wrong. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I wonder if Kris'll be surprised to see me on the trip. It's not like I was even properly invited. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I don't know why Kris didn't invite Brody on the trip initially. But really the-the main issue here is that there's a lot that Brody and Kris need to hash out. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Bernard, come here. Come here, Bernard. Bernard! &gt;&gt; ROB: Hang out with us. Come on. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What are you doing? What are you doing, huh? &gt;&gt; ROB: I love this dog, dude. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: He loves this Little punk. &gt;&gt; ROB: I flaked on Greece. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You don't think I don't know what you be doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: I just was... I was, like, not feeling myself. 592 00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,772 Like, gaining a bunch of weight, like... It's just frustrating to me that, like, I'm not happy going out if I'm not in good shape. You know what I mean? Within the next six months, if I don't get some... this together, than I won't want to, like, hang around everybody. You know what I'm saying? And I want to, so my mom doesn't cry and think something bigger is going on when, really, it's very simple. I let this go and I need to get it back together and that's it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You know what, though? It's all right if it's something bigger. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not, like, depressed, but... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Being depressed is not being wrong. 'Cause thathappens. But if you don't take care of yourself, you hurt your relationships, no matter what. I've been there. When you're just not acting the same or not looking a certain way-- all thatties in. I came out of it by doing for myself. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Like, I couldn't do it for Khlo. I couldn't do it for the name on the back of my jersey. &gt;&gt; ROB: Right. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I had to do it for, like, just... Lamar. Rob, you know, I realize how much he's been through. And as a man seeing that, I kind of wanted to help. And I think it's time for Rob to regain his confidence about his self, about what he's doing, about where he's going. Whatever he needs from me, I'll give it to him. I just want to see him happy. I don't want to see him laying here, you know, on the couch for days. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just stand the whole, the females doing their worry stuff, it's like... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You a man, baby. You're the Last Mohican. You're... &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I know. 625 00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:29,334 &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Robert Kardashian. Like, what do you expect? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Looks like we're here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Greece. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God. Look at this. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Wow, this is 631 00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:55,627 beautiful. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Wow, it's so pretty. &gt;&gt; BRODY: This is unbelievable. I'm beyond excited to be here in Greece. And this place is absolutely gorgeous. And so I'm just gonna try to do the most fun things I can, uh, in the short time that we're here and enjoy my family. Dude, if they have kiteboards around here, Brandon, we need to try it. 'Cause it's so windy here. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's tough. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Think Dad could do that? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: He'll figure it out. : All right, give the, uh, give me the sail. Give me the sail. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are we here? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Mykonos Retreat. Wow, this is pretty nice. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yay! &gt;&gt; MINA: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hello. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; MINA: I'm Mina, hi. Welcome, welcome to Greece. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Thank you so much. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; MINA: I wish you feel at home. &gt;&gt; BRODY: This is unbelievable. &gt;&gt; MINA: Do you want to see inside? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah! Please. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Sure. Yeah. Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Brody, come look at this. It's like living in a piece of art. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It is. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, this is amazing. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I love the sink. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: She loves the sink. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Do you love the sink? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: She loves the sink. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I do! This is like a dream house. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, I'm sold. We'll take it. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Should we go get in the water? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Uh, let me think about that one... Yes. &gt;&gt; LEAH: This is so beautiful. I can't even believe this. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Amazing. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I guess I'll... Oh! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Feels really nice. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How's that feel, Leah? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Mykonos is absolutely the most beautiful place I've ever been to. And I can't believe that I'm so lucky that I get to be on this trip. I'm so happy to be here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Greece, baby! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you ready to go to Greece? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We are gonna miss our flight if we don't get out of here. Today's the day. We're going to Greece. We are about to have another amazing family vacation and make a ton of new, beautiful memories together. All righty then, we're traveling light. We only have about 300 bags. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Have fun with the crazy women. Obviously I've been on a lot of family vacations with Kourtney's family. And never once has it gone completely smooth... throughout the whole vacation. I literally just want to go home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Go home. No one's keeping you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, book it. I don't evenwant to be on these stupid family trips anyway. I want to hang out with you or my kids or by myself. I don't want to hang out with everybody every day. So I figured you go to Greece. I'd stay in London a few days and see some of my friends. And I'll meet you in Greece and then we'll all fly home together. And not to mention, I am a lord when I'm in London. So, the royal people want to see their people. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See you in a couple days, Scottie. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Lube me up, my man. Ooh, it's chilly. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: All right, you're good. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, come on, bro. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Aw, yeah. When do the girls get here? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I think they'll be here around 7:00 tonight. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I wonder if Kris will be surprised to see me on the trip. It's not like I was even properly invited. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I don't know why Kris didn't invite Brody on the trip initially. And I'm sure that it might be a little bit awkward 'cause Brody knows about that, but really the-the main issue here is that there's a lot that Brody and Kris need to hash out because there is a lot of history there. I wonder if Dad and Kris are gonna share a room. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, I don't think that they share a room at home anymore. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Really? They don't share a room? They don't stay in the same room? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Well, you know, he got his own place so he could have his own space. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why would he get his own place? As if that place that they have is small. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: The only area that he gets that can be, like, his little man cave is that cor... that tiny little corner of the garage where he has his helicopters. I mean, it's thar... there and then where he sleeps are basically the only areas that he has to himself. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Aren't relationships supposed to be give and take? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Kris has been very generous with Dad and she does do a lot of things, but, you know, when you don't speak your mind and you don't stick up for yourself, you're doing yourself a disservice and you're not really honoring yourself. And I'd feel like it was a bit of an imbalance within the house. He got in trouble because he started to get cold working on the simulator in the garage, so he moved the simulator to the downstairs guest bedroom and he got in trouble for it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What?! Oh, wow, that sucks. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You know, he doesn't ask for much. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That sounds like a relationship I don't want to be in. Or I wouldn't be in. Even though I've had my own issues with my father growing up, it's definitely tough for me to hear that he's not appreciated as much as I think he should be. And he, you know, deserves to be respected. That sounds like a nightmare. 743 00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:06,404 &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's unfair. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Poor guy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So gorge! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so fab. This place is to die for. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Where's Rob? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's so annoying. He just cancelled last minute. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's a bummer that Rob didn't show up. Rob was my wingman, okay? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Backflip! Oh! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's cold. Water is cold. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah, it's a little bit cold. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Right nostril. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Get it? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Big old booger. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Just a booger, just hanging out. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, why isn't Rob here? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Full last minute just flake. "Not, I'm not going." &gt;&gt; LEAH: Why did he flake, though? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't know. It's crazy because first off, he was the one that amped me up to come here. "Yeah, let's go to Greece. We're both single. We'll go have a good time." You know, and then it's like, he gets me all fired up to come. I'm here now, and he's not. I think that your word is your everything, and Rob definitely gave his word, and he's not here. &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's a shame, because we're all in Greece and getting together and hanging out, and I just wish he was here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, I wish... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Be nice to hang out. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I wish I had a partner in crime. Now I just got to be the third wheel with you losers. 772 00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,556 &gt;&gt; LEAH: What an &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so excited to be here in Mykonos. It is gorgeous. &gt;&gt; MEGAS: This is for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; MEGAS: Welcome to Mykonos. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The fact that the mayor is here, greeting us with 779 00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,947 flowers, I mean, I feel like royalty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so pretty here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is so cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so gorge. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So fab. This place is to die for. Whoa, there's crabs! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're gonna go see the other villa. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Look who's finally here. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You made it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, doll. How was the water? Was it good? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look out here. This is crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think there's another pool. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let's go this way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at that moon. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Where's Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's in London. He doesn't come for three days. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Bruce, Kendall, Kylie come tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar's so bummed he can't be here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's bummed, but... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Where's Rob? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's so annoying. He just cancelled last minute. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's a bummer that Rob didn't show up. Rob was my wingman, okay? He's supposed to be here. He invited me on the trip. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He just said, "I don't want to be around everyone with, like, good bodies and feel bad." &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, God. I feel bad that he feels that uncomfortable going on a vacation with his family. I don't know what person on this earth would not want to be in a beautiful place like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just said, "You better be working out and eating right, then." &gt;&gt; BRODY: So that's really what it's all about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I totally get, like, having, like, your weight issues. Like, I've had them or... But it happens, but you still have to go on with life, and so you're missing out on a family trip, something that's, like... 815 00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,685 &gt;&gt; BRODY: He supposed to be my partner. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When did you guys get here? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I got here yesterday morning, early. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I got here this morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got here this morning. It is so pretty here. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, it is beautiful. I'm looking forward to a full day tomorrow. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, you know, it's all right. I was... I was, uh, glad I got the invite, so... No. The issue with Kris and I is that there was no real line of communication. I mean, honestly, I don't even remember the last family vacation that we went on with all of us like this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow. That's exactly... You read my mind. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Cheers. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Cheers, cheers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to look me in the eye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, we don't want you to have seven years of bad sex, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's already been more than that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew, Mom. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, geez. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, things have gotten off to a very awkward start with Brody. I want Bruce to explain to Brody that I didn't leave him out of the family vacation to Greece. You know, instead of owning up to what is going on in his life with Brody, he somehow shifts all of this blame on me. 842 00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:54,525 So ultimately, I get painted out to be the bad guy.

Oh, see? I haven't even had any yet. So, you guys went in the water today? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, Leah saw a whale. &gt;&gt; LEAH: No, I don't know... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then she says, "I don't know what it was." &gt;&gt; LEAH: It was an unidentified swimming object. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Which makes me so much more confident. &gt;&gt; LEAH: But it wasn't an aggressive one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: With her Zen personality. "I felt it's aura, you guys." &gt;&gt; BRANDON: She was feeling its vibe. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I felt it's aura, and it didn't want to harm us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, my biggest fear in life is a whale. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, you're actually really afraid of whales? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, whales are disgusting, and belly buttons are disgusting, too. &gt;&gt; LEAH: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Those are her two fears. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get chills every time I touch my belly. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Wow, that's interesting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Brody, will you pass the chicken this way? And then they'll pass their chicken. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not chicken. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Octopus. Try it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Octopus? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is this a James Bond movie? You guys, on another note, let's try to get Rob on the right track. And no matter what's going on here, I'm sure he had a really good reason. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I just don't understand why every time I... He's always like, "Yeah, I want to come to Malibu, and I want to come surf, and I want to hang out," and I'll text him or, you know, I'll be like, "Rob, let's go hang out. Come to Malibu." And then he just doesn't even return my texts. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa, whoa, Brody, I text you about the whole race thing in Long Beach. You never return my texts. &gt;&gt; BRODY: When? I never got any one of those texts. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I texted you and called you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You must have the wrong number or the wrong e-mail or I don't know, because I never got that, I swear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been trying to reach out to you, and you don't even respond. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You got to... I got to give you my right info then. I swear, I wouldn't... No, if I would... I wouldn't blatantly ignore you. We going to bed now? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Sleep tight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good night. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Okay, good night. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm going... Hey, I'm right behind you guys. I'm done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's, like, this awkward energy between my mom and Brody. I just feel like there's just some unfinished business between the two where they each want to say something, but they don't know how. &gt;&gt; BRODY: All right, I'm gonna go to bed as well. Good night, everybody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good night. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let's have a big day tomorrow-- I'm ready. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm seriously concerned 908 00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:41,626 about how the rest of the vacation is gonna go. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... I just want to do wild and crazy things. Pinky swear on the YOLO pad that you're not gonna chicken out on me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at your tummy. You look amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so scared. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Opa! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where did everybody go? &gt;&gt; BRODY: They went four-wheeling. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I haven't been included in one thing for this entire day. I might as well not be on this trip. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Go away! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to talk to you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm not filming this! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall had a little breakdown this morning. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I was so excited to be on this trip with everybody, and I'm not happy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, how are things with Brody? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like he sort of judges me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I think that she doesn't think I like her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just sense the tension and the awkwardness. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I've bit my tongue for long enough. I don't feel like you've ever given twoabout the way Brandon and I have grown up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is one of the most hurtful attacks that has ever been thrown my way
