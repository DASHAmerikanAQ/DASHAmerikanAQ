- ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I hear him! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Good evening. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Let me decide... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sorry we woke you. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are your teeth? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Better. &gt;&gt; KIM: You got 'em already done? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Smile. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're really skinny. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I lost a lot of weight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob had more Pop Tarts in his room today. He's on all the blogs. They said, "Did you eat Khloe?" &gt;&gt; LAMAR: They killin' him. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's unhappy; he's miserable... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's gained 50 pounds. I've never seen someone cry so much. &gt;&gt; KIM: He tells me he pulls over in the car and cries once a day. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, he doesn't feel good right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob's weight gain is really a combination of things. Eating late at night, not working out, sleeping in till when he wanted to... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I think it's cute. Mason got, like, a real-life teddy bear, now. &gt;&gt; KIM: We've got to get Teddy 24 00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,426 to our fat camp. This really is sad, you guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! This is looking good. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, it's been a lot of work when I get home. Had to rent a bunch of stuff... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We get our own private little concert. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you gonna do? New, old stuff? How many things you doing? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: All new. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All the new stuff? Cool! Brandon and Leah have been playing music for years, and, uh, tonight they have a concert. I love watching my son out there performing. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hi, everybody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hi. Welcome. &gt;&gt; LEAH: ♫ One mistake The target's painted ♫ On the back of his head She reaches down under ♫ His breath is getting deeper Now she's moving fast... ♫ &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It is really nice to see my dad coming around. You know, he wasn't very involved in our lives, growing up, and... Not having my dad around was pretty tough, but we've worked to make a better relationship in the more recent years. And it really means a lot to me. And I think it means a lot to him, as well. &gt;&gt; LEAH: ♫ It's the heat of the summer. ♫ &gt;&gt; LINDA: Want something to eat? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just ate. I'm all set. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: If you need to find me, I'll probably be over here. &gt;&gt; LINDA: This was my job today, doing the food. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love it. I'm gonna be here all night. &gt;&gt; LINDA: Good. Good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Linda, my ex-wife... we went through some very tough times. We were married about a four and a half year period. And in that time, we had Brandon and Brody. Things got just... really complicated. Then I was single for over seven years before I met Kris. I really thought that this is probably going to be a good time to really build my relationship kids. And, uh... i-it just didn't work out. I thought, let that simmer. Wait till they get a little bit older, can understand, and then hopefully build my relationship at that point. &gt;&gt; LINDA: Brody's still in Australia. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know, I've seen all his pictures. &gt;&gt; LINDA: Is that funny? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; LINDA: He's having fun, though. It's like his second home, Australia, now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm so disappointed. I thought, you know, for sure, Brody would be here. But you know, hey, it didn't work out. With these kids, it's so difficult. Everybody's got schedules, here, there. &gt;&gt; LINDA: You have to come to a real show. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know, I want to. &gt;&gt; LINDA: This is like the backyard... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Like a real... yeah, but every time you do, it's a 21 place. &gt;&gt; LINDA: I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LINDA: She's... you have a fake I.D., don't you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, she doesn't have a fake I.D. And you're not getting her one. &gt;&gt; LINDA: Oh, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's going on? &gt;&gt; ROB: I have never felt so down and depressed in my life. Like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm trying to be in the fashion industry, and I'm not gonna be taken seriously when I'm 50 pounds overweight. And it's embarrassing to the family. &gt;&gt; KIM: Robbie, I love you, and don't ever say that you're an embarrassment to the family again. Like, that like breaks my heart. &gt;&gt; ROB: I appreciate it. I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I will help you do whatever it takes to help you lose weight. Let's meet tomorrow, we'll come up with a plan. I don't want you to be depressed. We'll figure it all out. Rob feels that he looks... not himself, and I really want to help him do what he can to just be in the best shape, so he feels good about himself. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm ready. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, well, if you're ready, then I'm ready. &gt;&gt; ROB: Our lives are way too good to be depressed for real. &gt;&gt; KIM: And our lives are way too good for you to ever get one more tattoo. &gt;&gt; ROB: Let me at least get rid of mybefore I tattoo my chest, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, you'll literally ruin your life if you get a chest piece. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. If you want to make this man's dreams come true one time, you'll go with me to that house. It's this cutest old man. I see him probably every time I go for a walk. He walks with his wife. He's like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw... that's cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're from Italy. He won't go on airplanes, so he... he, like, drives to Italy. Like goes on his car... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't drive to Italy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He goes on his car on a boat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, who's calling me? Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. So, I am sopissed off, like... you know, I feel so bad for Mom. Dad's ex says that Mom used to beat me and hit me and kick me and, like, I don't... She claims Dad told her and blah, blah, blah, there's this, like, this diary... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She also claims Dad told her I was adopted. My dad was dying, and my father's ex-wife brought a priest to my dad's home and married my father. And now she's saying that my dad has a diary and she's gonna sell bits and pieces of his diary. And my dad would be disgusted by the fact that this woman is, like, slandering the mother of his children. Can't she leave us alone? It's been ten years since Dad has passed away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I doubt anybody is going to believe it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, everyone does believe them, 'cause I would-- &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, you'd be surprised. I don't want people to really believe it, and it hurts Mom's feelings, and I just feel bad, like, for her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My dad was a very private man. It's just... disrespectful for someone to sell, you know, these lies and rumors. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like we should just go over to the house. I mean, she's so, like, depressed, and just so sad about it. I'll meet you guys there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel so bad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Up here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robbie! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob! &gt;&gt; ROB: What's up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wow, it smells good in here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's go see Mom. Did you eat good last night? Or you were bad? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, I did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't lie. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say "Bible." &gt;&gt; ROB: Bible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you doing, Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just having an anxiety attack. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You really can't worry about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that you'll understand maybe when you have a baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, we don't want you to be sad. We love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just am trying to wrap my head around how somebody gets away with... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, there's a lot of bad people in the world, and you have to realize that. I think you should get an attorney. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think we should. I mean, there's something we can do, whether it's defamation... We're not gonna let this woman get away with something this crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would never claim to be the perfect parent, because I don't think anybody has an instruction book on how to raise their kids. But this woman is really crossing a line and accusing me of doing things that I would never dream about doing. I feel like, let's just drop it. I-I mean, she's already... &gt;&gt; KIM: We're not going to drop it. We're not gonna let this woman get away with something this crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just feel like the damage is done. &gt;&gt; KIM: Forty-six. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's no way. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's saying you're 50% body fat. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. Kim's taking these crazy measurements of me, and obviously the numbers don't add up, 'cause she's amoron. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bruiser! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I think that Bruce is a great father. He just wasn't a great father to me. You weren't around when I was a kid, and it's like... 185 00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:23,860 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now's not the time to talk about it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. I'll come down in a sec. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'll be in the kitch. : This is such a bad picture. There's so many better pictures. &gt;&gt; KIM: So are you really ready to do this? 'Cause I really want to help you. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm 1,000%. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, how... Okay, first we need to weigh you. We're gonna weigh you. Okay, so you weigh 241. Should we measure you? Okay, waist. &gt;&gt; ROB: The waist is the worst. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your waist is at your highest, I think. &gt;&gt; ROB: Your highest? &gt;&gt; KIM: Or is this your waist? &gt;&gt; ROB: This is my belly button right here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so it's, like, above... 46. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's no way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Forty-five. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's not right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Forty-five. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just feel like there's no way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, um, hips are lower. Will you hold that 'cause I don't want to touch your weiner. But I can't even put both arms around... &gt;&gt; ROB: It's fine. It's down near my knee anyway. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it goes lower. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim's taking these crazy measurements of me, and obviously, the numbers don't add up 'cause she's amoron. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, at your age range, it says you should be no more than 26% body fat, and it's saying you're 50. So you're, like, double. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not 50% body fat. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, on this thing. Millimeters, I mean. 50 millimeters. 50 millimeters. It is so exciting to me that Rob really does want this help. So I've set up a workout with our trainer, Gunnar Peterson, in the morning. We're gonna turn Rob from Mr. Klump back into his old self. Tomorrow, training. So get some rest. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yep. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have a big day ahead. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'll see you in the morning. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. 224 00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,181 &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't be late. &gt;&gt; KIM: Gunnar. &gt;&gt; GUNNAR: Hey, you good? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I feel so stupid having all this makeup on. I just came from an interview. &gt;&gt; GUNNAR: That was not intentional? All right, let's jump onboard with this. Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: He flaked on me. How many times, for real, has Rob flaked on you? &gt;&gt; GUNNAR: In the last two weeks, he's set up ten, and he made one. He's got to want it more than I do. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's sad. It makes me so sad. Like, I could cry if I think about it too long. Okay, bye, guys. Rob, it's Kim. I'm am here at the gym. 240 00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,921 You did not show up. This is sorude. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRODY: You guys really come, uh, you guys come nice and dressed up for the beach. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I really didn't know we were walking on the beach; I didn't know we were doing this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get back. Oh! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Bruiser. Bruiser. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You get a better signal from up there? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, much better signal. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You would think he's, like, never been to the beach in his life before. Was Bruiser always like that when you guys were growing up? Was he always very attentive, like, loving, throwing you up on his shoulders? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Was he? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Bruce, uh, my dad... I don't know which one to call it, but Bruce and my mother, they had some sort of messy divorce. I was the one child that didn't really have the greatest relationship with Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall! Kendall! Put your name. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Say that we were here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I grew up with my stepdad. Bruce was never around for me. I mean, I can't even tell you how many birthdays that went by where Bruce wasn't there and, uh, I resent him for that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, do we have any new music coming out? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yes, thank God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was there for the first gig. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You were there for... I know, it's true. &gt;&gt; LEAH: We weren't together. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know that. This is what happened. I go to Brandon after it's over with, and what did I say? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: "You got to get that girl in your band." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah, Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then I said, "Now you got to get her in the family." &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I was working on both for a long time before that. &gt;&gt; LEAH: That's sweet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: In a way, I see Bruce with Kendall and Kylie and Brandon-- I'm actually so happy for them. I think Bruce is an incredible human being, and I think that Bruce is a great father. He just wasn't a great father to me. You're so good with the girls, by the way. I really... It's interesting to watch how you are with the girls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Well... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Because it's, like, something I'm not really used to. You weren't around. I was a kid, and it's like... 290 00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,959 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now's not the time to talk about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Is Rob here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, he's not here. Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: He flaked on me this morning. Like, I literally had a gym appointment with him at 8:00 a.m. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's done that to me so many times. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so annoyed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's been really flaky. He claims he's depressed and this and that, but he doesn't ever work out. Lamar has tried to work out with him. I've tried to work out with him. He's irritating. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where is he? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's at some barbeque restaurant with one of his friends, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you know the name? 306 00:13:57,487 --> 00:14:00,794 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Smoke City. "May the Force be with you." &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: What's up? &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you order me some ribs? Hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: They're right there. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? This is reliable Rob, who flakes on me all the time. Having fun shoving barbeque in your mouth? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, man. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wish my brother would keep it real. &gt;&gt; FRIEND: He does sometimes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Does he flake on you guys? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't do that. I don't really do that. &gt;&gt; KIM: He straight looked me in the eyes and was like, "I'll see you at 8:00 a.m." Never shows up. &gt;&gt; ROB: To be honest, you work out so early-- 5:00, 6:00 a.m. type stuff. Like, I could wake up... &gt;&gt; KIM: I have a lot of stuff to do. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, well... 323 00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:54,080 &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously, Rob, I am really disappointed in you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My hazards are on. Will you turn the hazards off? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Have you heard anything else from the tabloids? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, well, no. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My friends, like, always-- not my friends, but, like, people-- are like, "Oh, your mom, like, does she hurt you or..." It's not that it affects me that much, it's just annoying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For Kylie to tell me that now her friends are feeding into these ugly rumors about me hitting my kids is disgusting. Anyone would think that I would hurt you, Kylie. It just... it kills me. I know that Robert would be really disappointed. 337 00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:45,462 It's something that you just can't fathom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let Rob binge out a little... reverse psychology. &gt;&gt; KIM: Put him in a room and just give him so much food. Burgers and fries and pizza. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get him so sick that he'd never eat fast food again. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Honestly, I look at him, and that's the craziest feeling, to be like, "I don't know you." This was my dad growing up. &gt;&gt; BRODY: How are you? Give me a hug. Look at this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are women's wetsuits? &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: Women's wetsuits? They're actually on the backside. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That looks like Kendall. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, this does. Kylie, Kendall. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Done. We got it. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: Okay, cool, perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can pregnant women surf? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yes, they can. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: They can-- if you were in Hawaii right now, they'd make you surf. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just not ready to be in a bikini. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You're having a baby. Don't even worry about your body. &gt;&gt; KIM: Our parents had us when they were in their 20s, and they bounced back. When my mom had Kendall and Kylie in her 40s, she was like, "I still can't lose the weight." &gt;&gt; BRODY: Wow, she was 40 when she had them? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, she had Kendall, and she thought she'd be done, and then Bruce was like, "Can we just have one more, so they can at least play with each other?" My mom was like, "You're gonna have to really take care of these two 'cause I'm so done. So if you want to take over and, like, carpool and do all of that?" He's like, "Sure." &gt;&gt; BRODY: I just want to build a relationship with him. I just want to know him. We have never really bonded or hung out. I've heard him say that my mom's always kept me from seeing him and all that, and that is the furthest thing from the truth. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: 'Cause my mom always was so supportive. That's his decision. I just wonder if that weighs on him; it's got to; I feel like-- &gt;&gt; KIM: But what I've also realized in life is that, like, I'm sure your mom remembers one thing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I'm sure Bruce remembers one thing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KIM: And you as a kid remember something totally different. There's a lot of family deets you don't know about. Families are crazy. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what I mean? That you just support, love. My dad's, like, ex-wife that he was married to for, like, two weeks, she recently came out saying that my mom beat me as a child. Like, that, like, all these ridiculous stories. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, your father Robert was the man, he was... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: ...one of the greatest people I've ever met. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like the best. &gt;&gt; BRODY: The best. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: Coming, doll. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have your salad. I love the crust. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I was getting a massage last night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: And the girl told me if you scratch yourself, that's how you get stretch marks. Like, because your skin gets really itchy, and Rob has them. Maybe for the fact that he flakes on me all the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are we gonna do? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know at this point. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, reverse psychology. We need to psych him out. I know someone who, they were trying to get their mom to stop smoking, so what they did, like, put her in a phone booth and gave her a pack of cigarettes, and were like, "Here." &gt;&gt; KIM: Go for it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Smoke until your heart is content." And they got so sick to their stomach, they stopped smoking. So maybe let Rob binge out a little. &gt;&gt; KIM: If we put him in a room and we just give him burgers and fries and pizza. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We get him so sick that he's like, "I could never eat fast food again." &gt;&gt; KIM: At this point, I'm willing to try anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, tonight... we're on a mission of hotness. We're gonna win the hot award today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Someone just wrote me and said, "Your mom's in San Diego at CVS right now." So I go, "Where's Mom?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, are you missing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Am I missing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, we couldn't find you, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're too old for an Amber alert-- 18 and under. &gt;&gt; KIM: A "gramber" alert. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim has been really funny since she's been pregnant. Okay... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom at least sounded like she was, like, in a good mood and in good spirits. 'Cause looking online at this and it says, "Punched, beaten and kicked by her mother." I know she always tells us, like, "Who cares what people say?"-- like, "Move forward." But she cries 'cause she doesn't want people to think that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's sensitive. She's an emotional girl. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like we should honestly hire Jake, the private, like, investigator. I think that it's important just to get the good indication of why she's doing what she's doing. So, Khlo, are you in? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why not? What theelse am I 437 00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:32,986 doing, guys? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let's go. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I'm terrible. &gt;&gt; BRODY: So am I. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Come here, Gus. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh-oh, Brody! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you kidding? I'm saving up for Bruiser. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Whoa! It is nice that Bruce is hanging out a little more, huh? &gt;&gt; BRODY: That's, uh, that's a rarity. I honestly, I look at him and that's the craziest feeling-- having a dad and really looking at him and being like, "I don't know you." Every time I watch his mannerisms and what he does, I just think, like... wow, this is the first I've seen of this and I'm 29 years old. It's so interesting to watch. Like, the little bits I see with him and the girls. It's like... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He was never like that with us... ever. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: My mom and my dad got divorced when I was about four or five, and Brody was about two or three. I would say that I started seeing more of my dad when Kris came into the-the picture. And then after a little while, that fizzled out as well. And Brody, he was younger when they got a divorce, and I think that him not being around was a lot harder on him than it was on me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: This was my dad. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: This was my dad... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: ...growing up. He taught me how to ride a bike. He taught me how to swim. He taught me how to do everything. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I guess I'm just wondering why he has such a wound and you don't. Why doesn't it affect you like it affects him? have those feelings, but in trying to become a better person, I've also not ever blamed anybody else. Doesn't matter who it is. You have to just accept people. And if you're having adversity with somebody, look for a way to improve yourself. &gt;&gt; LEAH: But you can tell that it's hard for him, too. You're pushing him, you know? And I'm glad that you're making this happen. I'm just saying that you have to know that this is hard for him and it's hard for you at the same time. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. Brandon and Leah are always telling me, "Just tell him how you feel." And I can tell Brandon and Leah how I feel, but Bruce, I'm afraid what he's gonna say to me, I'm afraid what I'm gonna say back, and so it's tough. 482 00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,271 There's-there's some deep &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously? What are you eating? You are a food addict. &gt;&gt; ROB: I am starting my metabolism. &gt;&gt; KIM: With cheeseburgers and fries? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brody seems distant. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Maybe it's just a good opportunity for you to open up. My dad has made a lot of excuses for why he wasn't around. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You'd think he'd be over it. 492 00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,284 He's almost 30 years old. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, some things &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Robbie. &gt;&gt; ROB: Dude, that's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have some. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm surprised that you would get this. Cheese fries? &gt;&gt; KIM: This makes me horny. I also ordered pizza and Chinese food 'cause I couldn't decide. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm just confused. We were just talk... like, I... were all about the health stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: If this is the path you want to go down. I am pregnant. I have an excuse. I'll go down this with you. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is a dream. This is what I do. Let me just have a bite of that. &gt;&gt; KIM: So good. Right? &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's pretty good. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really needed a pregnant friend. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not pregnant. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but you eat like one. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is awesome. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hold that bite. &gt;&gt; PIZZA GUY: Do you want any change? &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, no, thank you. &gt;&gt; PIZZA GUY: All right. Have a good one. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have a good night. Mmm-- how good does this look? &gt;&gt; Rob: Oh, that does look really good. Just thin crust? Why would you get thin crust? This is so cool... &gt;&gt; KIM: It took no convincing to get Rob to pig out on all this fast food. He is stuffing his face. I honestly feel like I could throw up. I am so stuffed. Will you carry my upstairs? &gt;&gt; ROB: Let me finish one more burger and then... You go put on your pajamas and then we'll go watch a movie or something. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I'm gonna waddle upstairs. My remote. Oh, what's that? &gt;&gt; ROB: Some ice cream. That's the best part of watching a movie, you have something to eat. &gt;&gt; KIM: So good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nicky? What are you doing? Seriously? What are you eating? Didn't that food last night make you sick? &gt;&gt; ROB: I am starting my metabolism. &gt;&gt; KIM: With cheeseburgers and fries that are left over from last night? &gt;&gt; ROB: I haven't touched the fries yet and the cheeseburger... &gt;&gt; KIM: You are seriously, like, a food addict. &gt;&gt; ROB: First of all, I'm enjoying my life right now. I eat well-- that's a great thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob has, like, a food addiction problem. It's sad, but no one else can help him with this. I think he's really gonna have to learn, you know, this on his own. I mean, bottom line is I can't help you, so when you're ready and you want the help, then, you know, you can help yourself. &gt;&gt; ROB: I will get to where I need to be, I guarantee it. I cannot wait to hit the gym tomorrow morning. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I believe it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Imagine if you had groceries to carry up every day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw, I can't... I... I... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; JAKE: Hi. Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Long time, no see. &gt;&gt; JAKE: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is my sister Khloe. &gt;&gt; JAKE: Hi, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys never met-- right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; JAKE: No, we haven't met. &gt;&gt; KIM: Jake's been my go-to private investigator for a while now. I think that it's important just to know what we can do to stop this woman. &gt;&gt; JAKE: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm good. Another day, another drama. I'm here because my dad's wife of a few weeks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She married him on his deathbed. &gt;&gt; JAKE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: She gets paid by the tabloids to sell stories. One week it's my mom would beat me as a child, and another week it's Khloe's not my biological sister. So, I just want to know: can we confront her? &gt;&gt; JAKE: It's dangerous to try and approach someone. Even though your intent may be honorable, she could still say anything. I can take a look at her and see if there's anything, as far as credibility. What I'd like to do is open her up, look at her background, see if she is married, see who she's been married to. There could be some interesting tidbits. &gt;&gt; KIM: Jake's probably right, but I still want him to get some information for us so we can really make this decision of where to go from here. &gt;&gt; JAKE: Well, anyway, I'll look into it. Give me a day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Call me, e-mail me. &gt;&gt; JAKE: I will. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Okay, here we go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is the one. It's going in. Ooh. Damn, that ticks me off. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, man. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I put in there closer. You just about hit it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. Wasn't good enough. Why don't you get flying again? It was such a big part of your life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was a big part of my life. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Then do it. What the hell? Brody's been working on getting his pilot's license, you know. It could be a bonding experience. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, sometimes, he kind of seems to be a little bit distant with me. The other day, he made a comment, you know, how close I am to Kendall and Kylie, and, like, he missed out on that, which I agree-- he probably did. 'Cause I wasn't around that much. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I think that it's-it's harder on him, for sure, than it was on me, just because of the age difference, you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah... you know, I feel like sometimes Brody, he feels like there's competition between his mother and I, like, if he spends time with me, it's not good for his mom. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: He's also very protective of Mom, you know? I mean, she did raise him and raised us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She did raise you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But he's never heard my side of the story. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, I know, yeah, but there's maybe some residual stuff, you know, left in Brody. Maybe it's just a good opportunity for you to try to open up. Through the years, I think my dad has made a lot of excuses for why he wasn't around, and at the end of the day, I think he needs to have a conversation with Brody. The conversation that is very overdue. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You think he'd be over it; he's almost 30 years old. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, some things last a lifetime for people, you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See how close that one was? 614 00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:08,172 God, you're up three-to-one. I hate this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at my stomach right after I eat. No, for real, isn't that huge? And it wasn't even that huge earlier? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I mean, maybe it just needs to come out. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. I have info from Jake. Do you want it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. "The widow was first married at 15 years old." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, she wasn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: "The widow has had two bankruptcies." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say "Bible." &gt;&gt; KIM: Bible. "And married five times." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not really surprised when I hear this woman just filed bankruptcy a couple times. I mean, it's obvious motivation for her to want to sell stories. We're definitely gonna do something to stop it, and that's that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You called an attorney? &gt;&gt; KIM: The meeting is just to see what we can do about these lies and rumors. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so sad that she would try to paint my mother out to be this horrible person. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Growing up, you were not around. I can't count how many birthdays I didn't even get a phone call. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I had to, like, back off. Your mom was in control. &gt;&gt; BRODY: But if you wanted to try that hard, I think you could've. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Killer shot on Kendall. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, we're gonna start. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That was glorious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Which one's the best one? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Rock on, sister. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do this. Nothing makes me happier to watch my kids spend time together. That just makes my day. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Okay, this is fun. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Daddy, get away! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ha! How does that feel, Dad? &gt;&gt; ROB: That sucks when Kendall and Kylie beat me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was dead last. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Looking fit, man. Are you eating? How's your eating? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, great. Here and there, I'll go get sushi, a spicy tuna and crispy rice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So what happened to Brody? Why didn't he show up? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I honestly don't know. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why don't you just call him next time? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I thought he knew. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, if he doesn't call you, then you should call him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm the one that has to reach out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, somebody's got to do it. It's a two-way street. &gt;&gt; ROB: Just to hang out with my father... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's always me. ...at this point in my life is a big deal to me, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; ROB: I would die to have that type of relationship. If my dad were alive, I would spend, you know, every day with him, if I could. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Here we are. Is that you with your sister? Where are you going? Huh? What? You look so nice. Huh? &gt;&gt; ROB: Car. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Car. &gt;&gt; ROB: Daddy. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What? &gt;&gt; ROB: Daddy. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Gonna go bye-bye with Daddy? &gt;&gt; ROB: My best part was skiing with my dad. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Aw. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: My best part was skiing with my son. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that is... &gt;&gt; ROB: I could never live my life and have a relationship with my dad. I definitely would tell my kids every day that I love them. You got to be the bigger person. Don't just assume he's gonna show up. I definitely think you got to go after it. That's all I got to say. It's time for Bruce to show some emotion and just have the same relationship that he kind of has with Kendall and Kylie and even us. He definitely needs to, you know, sit down and tell his son how much he loves him. 690 00:32:42,515 --> 00:32:46,457 Just remember, it's never too late to reconnect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris, what are you doing? What are you eating? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A salad. Wow, we're fancy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bling bling, baby. Why is a flower blocking your vagina in that picture? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, wow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa, whoa. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Kim, Kourt and I are here with Todd, our attorney. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You called an attorney here? &gt;&gt; KIM: The meeting is just to talk to Todd to see what we can do about Dad's ex spreading all these lies and rumors. Come on, you guys, Todd is here waiting. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so sad that she would try to paint my mother out to be this horrible person. She's really hurt our hearts just by dragging my father's name through so many things, and she's definitely hurt my feelings. Oh, I just want toon her face. &gt;&gt; TODD: So, here's the thing. Let's start with a couple observations. First of all, you've got defamation, you've got libel, and you've also got privacy issues. There were photos I think we've seen in some of the articles that have been published so far. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. I took a picture... &gt;&gt; TODD: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...of her and Robert and my kids, my four kids, in front of my Christmas tree, and she sold it to the tabloids and said, "See, Kris wasn't even here at Christmastime." &gt;&gt; TODD: And you were taking the photo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was in my house. &gt;&gt; TODD: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She married him. She propped him up on a pillow, basically, in his own bed and married him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, he wasn't in bed; he was on the couch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, propped him up on the couch and married him. &gt;&gt; TODD: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: As much as, like, I don't like this negative energy... 729 00:34:37,873 --> 00:34:40,745 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just can't... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's okay, Mom. &gt;&gt; TODD: One of the things that has to be shown is a reckless disregard for the truth-- malice, and, um, this is about as bad as I've ever seen it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She wouldn't let Mom sit with us at the funeral, and I threw a conniption fit. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, she tried to get my mom to not sit in the front row of my dad's funeral. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like sit in the back row. &gt;&gt; TODD: If we go, we go all the way, we go hard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; TODD: And no turning back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: At this point, I have a responsibility to do everything that I can to protect my family. It's really wrong what she's done. &gt;&gt; TODD: It is really wrong. It's really wrong. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can we just press charges? Let's just leave it at that. &gt;&gt; TODD: Okay, okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Bruce! Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's up? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are we brewing now? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Almond milk. Want some? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Almond milk. Why don't you just go buy milk? &gt;&gt; BRODY: What's going on? How are you? &gt;&gt; LEAH: 'Cause this is much better than milk. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Cheers. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cheers, yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Cheers! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, shut up, Bruce. You know you like it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: He knows he likes it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, you know, it does taste kind of milky. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Where are you coming from? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The house. I heard you were here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you saying you were looking for me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I was looking for you. I think it's really time that we kind of break the ice here. I want to take a chance here, and hopefully, it's gonna get better. 766 00:36:18,564 --> 00:36:21,437 &gt;&gt; BRODY: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I heard that you and Brandon had been talking, and had some long-lost issues with me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I mean, you know better than anybody else, there was a lot of time growing up that you were not around. I can't count how many birthdays, like, happened that I... I didn't even get a phone call from you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You know, and at the end of the day, that's not too hard for... You can't say that, yeah... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I agree with that. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You know, a phone call on... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I take the blame for that. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You know, and-and I... There were times where I was... That really hurt. You always want to hear from your actual father, you know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: And that definitely goes through your head, thinking, what's so important why he can't just give me a phone call regardless of what's happening with him and my mother? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See, you don't know all of those years, obviously. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, I do. I-I... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You were just a baby, and stuff, you know? And all the things that were going on. I'm certainly not here to badmouth your mother, but when you go through a divorce and all of that, things can get... pretty... yeah, pretty tough. There came a point where it became so difficult to continue my relationship with my kids, the best I could, that it's almost like I had to, like, back off when your mom was around and-and in control. &gt;&gt; BRODY: My mother never badmouthed you to me ever once. She never... She always encouraged us to go see you. I mean, you had just as much say as she did, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ab-Absolutely, and I tried... Put it this way. Put it this way. &gt;&gt; BRODY: If you wanted to try... If you wanted to try that hard, I think you could have. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just got a voicemail from Todd. They've been trying to serve the papers. She's running. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can she keep talking until she gets served? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. There's no gag order. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I mean, if you wanted to try that hard, I think you could have. It was really tough not having a dad around. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And it was tough not being there. You know? I see, I didn't handle things right here. Um, and that's the biggest regret of my life. Regardless of what happened in the past, I want to have a relationship with my son. 816 00:38:55,596 --> 00:39:00,040 And the bottom line is, I have to take the responsibility. You know, for me, one of the big disappointments in life has been missing out on the relationships that I had with my kids when they were growing up. There's nothing worse, from my standpoint, than... than missing those things. I've always tried to kind of make up for that-- with Kendall and Kylie-- making sure I don't make the same mistakes I've made in the past, so... I-I can't take those years back, but I certainly can learn from those things. 827 00:39:29,973 --> 00:39:35,017 I always want to be part of all my kids' lives. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm not mad anymore. I'm not resentful. I'm just more... What's done is done. What's the past is the past. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, we both missed out on a lot. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, I agree. I totally understand where you're coming from. Going forward from now, I think that we should just work on establishing a better relationship, and always be honest with each other, 'cause life is not getting any longer. I want to be able to feel like I knew my father, like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I really do. I resented Bruce for a long time, and I feel like I've missed out on so much, so, now it's time to really get to know my dad, and I will give him a second chance. All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You guys okay? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Talk it out? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I need some almond milk. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You need some? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look so cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks. Um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm glad you guys dropped by. I just got a call from Todd and work. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you put Jane on the e-mail? It has nothing to do with Elizabeth. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dolls? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know who Jane is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I don't want to... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Jane S. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys? I just got a call from Todd, and he said they've been trying to serve the papers from everybody, and she's running from service. I really don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KIM: She can't hide forever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Unless she wants to run to another country, and that would be really exciting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just want to stop it since Dad isn't here to protect himself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's the position that you've always taken about your dad, but I think at this point, we just let legal handle it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can she keep talking until she gets served? 866 00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,279 &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. There's no gag order. Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's everything going? How are the workouts? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm, like, excited now, 'cause Lamar, like... Him and I just had a really serious talk, and he was just, like, "Yo, I've been where you're at." Like, he wants to start training with me. Um, this... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't even know how it goes. &gt;&gt; ROB: Lamar needs people-- and same with I-- like, around you that are positive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hi gorgina. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ah! Look at you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look very cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Guess what? &gt;&gt; ROB: You look like the girl in Beetlejuice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look amazing! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Viagra. &gt;&gt; KIM: Guess what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: That slippery snake has been served. We finally got that slippery... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ah! &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, did we get it on video? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That slippery sucker. &gt;&gt; KIM: That slippery snake. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, she finally got served. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How? &gt;&gt; KIM: Literally, we had the serving person call and say that they wanted to, like, set up a meeting with her to pretend they were interested in a property in escrow, and they met at a hotel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop... &gt;&gt; KIM: And she's like, "I'll be the tall blonde wearing this." And they're like, "Okay, I'll be in a gray suit." And so, she just met them in the lobby, and he's like, "Hey, I'm such and such. You've been served." And, like, gave it to them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: And it was, like, done. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It really warms my heart to think that my girls care so much that they want to stick up for me. It's just a relief that finally, we've been able to speak up and say, "Look, this isn't right." What is... good does it do to, like, avoid service, though? &gt;&gt; KIM: Nothing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The whole thing is so silly at the end of the day, but I really appreciate you guys sticking up for me, and wanting to make things right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Girl, we got your back. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we're not having a gun in the house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It'll be locked away. Go on. That's what I'm talking about. It's my responsibility to protect this family. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You have an opinion. &gt;&gt; KYLIE &amp; KENDALL: And so does he. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And you said it's... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys lied to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was supposed to be deposed, like, in December. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's only getting more and more pregnant, and now to have to deal with all this extra stress and BS-- it's not healthy. &gt;&gt; KIM: It hurts so badly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah...
