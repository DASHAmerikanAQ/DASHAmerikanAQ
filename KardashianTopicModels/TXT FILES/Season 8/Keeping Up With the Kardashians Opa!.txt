- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Off to Greece. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know, and I've never been on vacation with Brandon, Brody or any of them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Be a good trip. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I'm excited. &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's so pretty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's so cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This place is to die for. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa, there's crabs! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Allie sent me a picture of Scott leaving the club with some girls. It doesn't make me happy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are they hiding like that? That looks so bad. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I have a serious issue, and I'll tell you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know you do. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I think it's time for Kris and I to actually have that talk that we've always needed to have. Brandon and I are not Kendall, Kylie, Kourtney and Kim. Those are your babies. I don't feel like you've ever given twoabout Brandon and I. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is one of the most hurtful attacks, I think, that 21 00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:49,716 has ever been thrown my way. Sorry. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't look at me and not knowing me for... 30 years? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna say, "Wow, I'm-I'm seeing this" and... little snapshots of my personality or my life or my... &gt;&gt; BRODY: 100%. Absolutely. That's why I just want to be honest with you. Like, I-I'm, you know... There's been a lot of times in my life where I've just kind of been dishonest with myself, and I think that there are some things in your life that you need to look at yourself and be like, "Are these things really what's important in life?" I don't care about this. I care about this. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: This, I don't give a about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, but this is how we came to this. &gt;&gt; BRODY: And that's... You're right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: So, however, these are things that we need to talk about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not about the stuff. It's about heart. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I look over and I see my mom and Brody in a heated discussion, and I feel the need to step in. Hi, boys and girls. I like Brody's honesty. I think he's allowed to say what he wants, but she does put off this front like that, but that's not who she is. And that's why we're not like that. Like, you know, her and Kim may like to have, like, their flashier things, but I feel like genuinely, like, her soul is not like that. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You're an incredible mother to your children, and I think that some discord between Linda and Bruce and maybe you in the past has 54 00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:42,396 created some sort of a little... a little hiccup. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When I met Bruce, your parents had been separated for eight to ten years. It wasn't like I was breaking up a marriage, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, but where are we going with this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He came with kids. I was really excited, and I know that sounds crazy... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know you were. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...but I was so excited. So what I thought was gonna be this amazing relationship from the get-go, maybe it didn't happen in that... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Gotcha. I get it. It never does. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...time frame. It happened later, you know? And everything happens for a reason, and I now get that. She didn't talk to Bruce for five years, and she wore black. Literally wouldn't speak to him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, I literally wore black one day. I don't know why everyone says that I wore black, but I wore black one day... &gt;&gt; KRIS: She had a hard time. I want you to honestly know that I'm really trying to do my best. I'm trying to be a good mom and I'm almost there. I love you. I really do. And I always have. What we all wanted was just to be, like, this magical... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you're saying you're happy now that we're all hanging out and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I love it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Growing up, I-I might've thought that Kris was the villain, in a sense, but it's great that we're able to now open those lines of communication. But Kris and I right now, we're not by any means perfect, you know? Uh, we definitely have so much more to learn about each other. I actually genuinely enjoy your company and have fun with you and I enjoy talking to you and I... You've been a part of my life my whole life. However, we've never really gotten to know each other. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. It's like I want you guys around all the time, like-like them. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Then hit me up. You have my number. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want you around all the time. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, now you have my number. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, we haven't done this since we were little kids. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Like, were babies. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Finally, a breakthrough. I feel hopeful that he's getting me a little bit and my point of view and I'm getting him, and it's time for a new beginning. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I really don't think that you're... I think that you're incredible. And I think that this trip was the best thing that could've ever happened to us. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey. Hey, guys. How you guys doing? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I love Rob, and I wish he was here. I don't... I don't want him to, you know... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I got close to convincing him to come at one point. &gt;&gt; BRODY: When? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: A few days before we left. The Jenner side is really laid-back, and I didn't really get a great relationship with my older brothers, just because... I don't know much about it, but I know that there was tension with that side of the family, so we didn't get to really do the whole family vacation thing when I was a kid. So it's fun to get to do that now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! Kris is right behind me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Can we get a glass of, uh... Do you have, like, a-a rosé? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Rosé? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Rosé wine? Uh, yeah, like, maybe a bottle. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So you're getting her a whole bottle? Is he trying to liquor up my wife? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Apparently. I'll definitely take a little responsibility for, uh, making things a little awkward between Kris and I. Um, and now I think that our relationship is growing, and I feel very grateful for that. Did I get it right? &gt;&gt; KRIS:That's my Brody. Okay, I'll just get this bottle open then get a straw and I'm good. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, you don't need to pound it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mmm. I did it without touching the lip of the bottle. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're moving on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And people said we had no talent. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. You shouldn't have your window open. A Peeping Tom. Were you smoking marijuana? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Do I need to? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have a coffee machine in here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but I can't turn it on. I don't know why it's not working. So, I got this. Took the camera out for you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I was looking at Kim, and she just doesn't seem... happy. You know? She's so... just miserable. And I... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, pregnancy isn't for everyone, and it's not... doesn't seem like she's enjoying hers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kimberly is fragile right now. She's had it really rough in the last few months of pregnancy, and I feel bad. You know, you have to find your happiness. Babies brought me my happiness, for sure. I mean, you throw yourself into your kids and it's, like, delicious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The baby will bring her her happiness. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you guys eating already? Let's go eat. Come upstairs. I'm up there by myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, Kris. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you coming? Those are nice little jammies. I'm starving. To be able to go to Greece and spend quality time in such a beautiful place with your family is pretty amazing. &gt;&gt; LEAH: This looks so good. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What's on the agenda for today? What do you guys feel like doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall said she's gonna sleep all day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel kind of bad because I said to get wine, but I forgot to tell them to get beer for Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He loves his beer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Recently, I watched him have three beers, and he just got in an argument with Michael Phelps over gold medals. That was pretty fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce was in an argument with Michael Phelps? &gt;&gt; BRODY: He was rousting Michael Phelps, saying that it was too easy to get that many medals 'cause he can do... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He was like, "I only have one, but that's the one you want," you know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "I have the best one." &gt;&gt; BRODY: It was so funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Keeks, did you sleep the whole night? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look so miserable. &gt;&gt; KIM: I, like, really don't care right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She just looks like she is, like, having a tough time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I... I really don't know how she goes day to day and carries those boobs around. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I don't know either. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's almost like you need a crane. She's... They're... &gt;&gt; LEAH: You do, huh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...this big. I've never seen anything... Like they're two watermelons. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's not even milk in them yet, which is, like, the... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I forgot, Kylie, we're British today. Did you tell Brandon about our... British today? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Me and Khloe are British today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have a queen of England. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, a queen. You have a queen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cheers. Have a jolly good day. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Cheerio. When you decide to be British, let us know. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're going to ATV like that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, he's, like... He is a... like, a beach boy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Not even some shoes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, myself and the Jenner boys decide to go ATVing. Typically the boys, they like to do a lot of activities that are very much outside my comfort zone. ATVing, dirt biking-- I can handle this one. Why isn't mine moving? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, I know why. Here, let me show you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Is there a parking brake? &gt;&gt; BRODY: There you go. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Go, Bruce, go! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We love Greece! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We love it here! &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's awesome to see Khloe get out there on the ATVs and go have fun and get her sort of embracing the whole Jenner way of life. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: If you make me fall... &gt;&gt; LEAH:I got a good one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE and KYLIE: Greece! Greece! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, YOLO in Greece! 214 00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,750 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: YOLO, YOLO, YOLO, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! What are you doing in here? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where did you guys go? &gt;&gt; BRODY: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where did everybody go? &gt;&gt; BRODY: We went four-wheeling. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Did you really? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No one asked me to go. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't know. I mean, it was kind of just a spur-of-the-moment thing. We all were just like, "Let's go." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. That's weird. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What? Are you upset about that, that nobody asked you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I-I've been sitting here not doing anything. Going on this trip, I was expecting to spend a lot of time with my family, but I've been left out, and it's a little disappointing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's supposed to be the hot spot in Greece. &gt;&gt; KIM: Santorini is honestly one of the prettiest places I've ever been in my life. If this tickles, I'll die. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the weirdest thing ever. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...like it! I don't like it! Oh, my God! Can I take 'em out? : I don't like it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I might as well not be on this trip. Like, I haven't talked to one person this past day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, I'm sorry. I don't want you to feel like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall, why aren't you talking to me? ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, I heard this is heaven. &gt;&gt; LEAH: It is? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Did you try this? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's not pie. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Try that one. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I think it's, like, Key lime pie with, like, a cookie crust or something. &gt;&gt; BRODY: These turds over there. kooks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What, the paps? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, I don't think... They're just kind of chilling. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't get where they are. &gt;&gt; BRODY: They're right there. You can see 'em all standing. Look at 'em all standing over there. You can see them now. That's where they've been all day. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have been really scrutinized my whole pregnancy about what I wear, my weight, which is ridiculous. And it's, like, frustrating that paparazzi is here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's an epic shot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: While we're eating pie in our bathing suits? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, boy. Yeah, mate. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My family and I, we're now leaving Mykonos to go to Santorini, and we're so excited, because we want to kind of see as much of Greece as we can. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay, I'm not leaving. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! Opa! Opa! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Santorini! &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, this place is supposed to be the hot spot in Greece. This is the place. Oh, look at that place down there with the blue dome. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is gorgeous here. Santorini is so gorgeous. Like, it's honestly one of the prettiest places I've ever been in my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, Kourtney, when does Scott get here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like we haven't seen him in a week. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, we haven't. Scott decided to stay in London while we were in Mykonos and just meet us in Santorini. But you never know with him. I hope he makes it and doesn't have a panic attack and not show up. I really need some Greek culture though, so I know that I was in Greece. 280 00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,851 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll get you a Greek salad; you'll be fine. &gt;&gt; ELSA: Welcome to the Andronis Hotel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nice to meet you. Thank you for having us. &gt;&gt; ELSA: My pleasure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; ELSA: Would you like to follow me to go to the hotel? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Sure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, look at that view. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need my camera. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, my... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now that's a view. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is so ridiculous. Like, could you imagine living here? This is, like, unreal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Santorini is the most beautiful place I've ever been. That's where I want to go to die with my husband and just be like, "This is it; we're in heaven." &gt;&gt; BRODY: Kris, champagne. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Fill it up. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Fill me up. Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Cheers. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Cheers, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's to Santorini. &gt;&gt; ELSA: Follow me to go to your suite. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, looks beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:What is this? Wow, we're in a cave! We're in a cave! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Did you see Kim's bathroom? &gt;&gt; BRODY: This is beautiful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And this is a good workout. &gt;&gt; ELSA: I'm sorry about the steps, but it's a characteristic of the island. You're gonna find a lot. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good thing I didn't bring one pair of heels. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I was worried about Brody, but he's in flats. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, look at our sex bed! We have a Hugh Hefner bed! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I hope it spins! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's my suite? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, let's go check it out, boys and girls. 314 00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:52,178 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Bruce's room? Look at the view. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hello, hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No way. How crazy. &gt;&gt; EMPLOYEE: If you try for the first time, it's better to try here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You literally just put your feet in? &gt;&gt; EMPLOYEE: Close your feet, and very slowly put both of them inside. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You doing it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You already started? I've heard a lot about these fish pedicures, and I've seen a lot of pictures of people doing 'em, but I never thought it was, like, this... crazy. It's so, so weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: If this tickles, I'll die. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're eating our feet. This is crazy. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, my God, that is a trip. : It's ticklish. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, go with me. Go. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That is the weirdest... That is a trip. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so scared to do this. Can I take 'em out? : I don't like it! I hate it! Oh, my God! I'm gonna cry! This fish pedicure is, like, the grossest thing I have ever experienced. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't cry. Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Try it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not after that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Try it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Dinner was at 8:00, right? It's 8:31. Where is everybody? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I-I told you at the beginning of this trip, "Everybody, just take a chill pill." You mellow out, and when it happens, it will happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hello, everyone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Khlo, you look fabulous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe made it. &gt;&gt; ALL: Hey... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Mom, you look gorgeous! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. Where's Kylie? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at all these... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look who's here-- the Lord. &gt;&gt; BRODY: How was the flight? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The Lord was in London. So the Lord has finally left London, and he has now arrived in Greece. It's nice to finally get here, and the truth is, I think I needed that time in London, and now I'm ready to put all my energy into a good trip here in Greece. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, what were you doing in London? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I did, like, a club appearance. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I try. &gt;&gt; BRODY: This is good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall and I were passed out. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's crazy how tired you get, like, in the middle of the day. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, I didn't know where anybody was, so I was, like, watching TV and then all of a sudden I fell asleep. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, you were? You should have come and done the fish thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You had no idea we were doing the fish? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No one told me what... I thought everybody was going to their rooms. Like, last time I saw everybody, everybody was going to their rooms. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Sorry about that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's it going, Kendall? Have you had any... What's going on? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nothing, no one... Like, I might as well not be on this trip. Like, I haven't talked to one person. I just can't, like, stand everybody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am not as outspoken as my family, but that doesn't give them any right to just act like I'm not there and leave me out of things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, I'm sorry, I don't want you to feel like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I haven't been 387 00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:22,488 included in one thing for this entire day. I've been sitting in the room, like, while you guys are all doing stuff that I, like... Like, it's just like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't get it. Kendall. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you crying? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall, why aren't you talking to me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Will you jump in a pool with your clothes on? What better way to show the Jenners how the Kardashians do a family vacay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're naked, Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Go away, everybody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, I was so excited to be on this trip 400 00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:05,297 with everybody. I'm not, like, happy at all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've been sitting in the room, like, while you guys are all doing stuff, but I, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't get it. Kendall? Kendall, why aren't you talking to me? She needs a few minutes alone to calm down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's like that with all of us. We're all annoying her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe and I have decided we should do something wild and weird with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like what? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Will you jump in a pool with your clothes on? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I already got champagne all over me. Why not? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, she's in. Kourtney, you do it, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That would be so fun. We're gonna do it together. One, two, three. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And how I left you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, everybody, into my room. Many, many years ago, when we started going to Mexico, we started this silly tradition. We would jump in the pool with all of our clothes on. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Party time! &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, what better way to show the Jenners how the Kardashians do a family vacay? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! &gt;&gt; ALL: Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, hey! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want everybody out of my room right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're jumping in the pool, and then we're out of your hair. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Let's go! We're going in! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going in! &gt;&gt; KIM: It is my last night here in Greece, and I'm getting up really early in the morning to fly to Paris to go spend time with my boyfriend. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Come on! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Cold in there, Leah, or no? &gt;&gt; LEAH: No, I'm peeing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What makes these vacations so special is moments like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're naked, Kourtney! You're wearing all white. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, hi, Santorini. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The memories that we have as a family are what makes me the happiest. &gt;&gt; KIM: Night. Oh, I won't see you guys. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I love you. It was really... It was good seeing you. &gt;&gt; KIM: So fun. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Good hanging. Yeah, absolutely. I'll see you soon, yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. You know, I'm very pregnant. It was really hard for me to, like, be on this vacation, but I'm so glad that I came here. It's just so magical, and I'm glad that I spent an amazing vacation with my family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what's wrong with you? You're afraid to live on the wild side. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, that's exactly right. I like to live on the sleep... No, honey, don't even think about it! Don't even think about it. Hey, no. Do not even think about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't even think about it. Look, this is the only shirt I brought, and you're gonna get it all wet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're such a stick in the mud! Oh, some people don't know how to have fun. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You guys got... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what a bummer it is that I'm here, and look how pale I still am. White girl problems, right? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Who cares? You have fair, nice skin. It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, if these are my problems, I'm living a pretty good life. &gt;&gt; BRODY: So, tell me if you think this is totally crazy. You know how Bruiser, your mom, Kris, she won't let him have his little... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Life? Anything? Balls? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay. You already got it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm already down for this. Are we gonna get Bruce's balls back? &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, all we want to do, we just want to create that little grass area by the outside patio to the right into a putting green. And think about how much he would use that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Brandon and I had the great idea of getting a putting green for our dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I lost out on that bill. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why can't you put one in now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, she'd probably kick me out of the house. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Got to fight these battles, man. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You got to fight them a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's very easy for you to say. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He wants a putting green so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She might literally kill us. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That's what I was afraid of, but, you know, power in numbers. I'm a little nervous about the whole putting green thing. That could create a little more conflict with Kris and myself, but there's a bigger picture there-- having Bruce have a voice in the house and be able to make decisions on his own without having to ask somebody. I have literally been in Greece for now five days, and I have sat in my room every single night and gone to bed early. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't just sit in the room. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Exactly. &gt;&gt; BRODY: So you coming out with us? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have to have some sort of plan, but if we're, like, God, three bars are lame, then we should just cut back. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Put it this way, there's no such thing as lame when we're all together. As long as I got my crew, we're good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you keep preaching, honey. I personally love the Jenner boys, and we are getting closer and closer. So, since everyone is asleep, Kylie and myself and Brody, we all decide it's time to have a good time. 506 00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,875 &gt;&gt; BRODY: Get in. I'll get in front. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is ridiculous looking here though. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, this is, like, to me, this is paradise. You got to get on a surfboard. We got to get Mase on a surfboard. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'd like to get Mason out there. That would be cute. &gt;&gt; BRODY: And don't let Bruiser keep you away from that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's on his own agenda. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, hey! Hey, hey, hey! &gt;&gt; SCOTT:It's literally like a little motorcycle just starting up. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! So, I know Kourtney was a little upset with that whole thing that got on whatever site. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, obviously. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was like, "Cool pics," and then he's like, "They're not good. They're horrible, actually." &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, what happened with that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, it's unfortunate that in this day and age, you can't even let your buddies, like, hook up with chicks in front of you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: At the end of the day, you shouldn't put yourself in those type of situations. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course, but... &gt;&gt; BRODY: You know what I mean? Like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just, like, trying to get into acar. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, you're right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's, like, such an awkward thing to tell your friend, "Yo, you can't get in the car with me." And then you got someone looking at you like, "Who thedo you think you are?" &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, you're right. You're absolutely right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And then you look like an idiot, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; BRODY: You're right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So it's kind of like... It's so annoying. It's just annoying. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, you're right. Bottom line, Scott, is you were missed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Slowly, I see bodies emerging out of... out of the rocks. Breakfast, down there. Brody! We're going down. Let's go down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall's not here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Where is she? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall is not at breakfast. And last night, she said she felt left behind, and I would never want Kendall to think we didn't want to hang out with her. I got to go find her. If Kendall wanted to hang out with us, the door's open. We're your sisters. Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Leave. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Go away! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to talk to you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm not filming this! I'm not... like... Go away, everybody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm leaving in a couple hours, and I don't get why Kendall is mad, and she's taking it out on us. Kendall? I want to know why you're so mad at me. I need your help. Kendall was just, like, hysterically crying. She was like, "And I thought Brody and I were gonna hang out more this trip." Just maybe... be aware of it. I hope that when I'm gone, the family reach out to Kendall and want to hang out with her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like we'll be annoyed if we don't do something active. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I won't be annoyed if I don't go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is a little bit annoyed when he hears about the plans for the day, but he just got here, and he just needs 570 00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:45,757 to suck it up and see Greece with everyone. ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Go away, everybody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't get why Kendall is mad, and she's taking it out on us. Kendall? I want to know why you're so mad at me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, I was so excited to be on this trip with everybody, but, like... I'm not, like, happy at 580 00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:15,187 all. I can't, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You may want to sit next to this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What a beautiful, beautiful morning. Can we get some scrambled eggs? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's Khloe's helicopter? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Those big choppers, like, one of those big ones. Khloe! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We just saw your helicopter land. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it's a beautiful helicopter. Um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Brody, I need your help. Kendall was just, like, hysterically crying. I'm leaving in a couple hours, and I feel horrible that Kendall feels this way, she feels this left out. And I will do everything I can in a couple hours to make it right. Kendall feels, like, really left out. She was, like, crying, and was like, "You and Kylie are sharing a room..." &gt;&gt; BRODY: What do you mean? No, she wasn't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She was like, "And I thought Brody and I were gonna hang out more this trip, and we haven't, and I really love him." I was like, "Just say something though." This whole vacation that Kendall's been here, you know, she's been isolating herself. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What's on the agenda for today? What do you guys feel like doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall said she's gonna sleep all day. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, she's... she's up! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How long have I been asleep? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, three hours. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where did everybody go? &gt;&gt; BRODY: We went four-wheeling. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Did you really? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No one asked me to go. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't know, I mean, it was kind of just a spur-of- the-moment thing. We all were just like, "Let's go." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall's shy. She's more introverted, and that's just who she is. And it's okay that she's like that. There should be a shy one in our family. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That's terrible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And she was like, "I thought on this trip I would be so happy, but I feel, like, alienated." When I leave-- since she brought your name up-- make an effort to, like... Even if she seems anti, just be like, "Are you sure you don't want to?" Like, ask her maybe two or three times, 'cause that's the type... She wants to feel babied, I think. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Wow, that's a bummer. I don't... I don't... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I felt so bad. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I didn't know that Kendall was so sensitive. I get to know new things about my little sisters every day we get to spend time. I-I wish I would've included her. I'm gonna try everything in my power to make that up to her. Are you kidding me? I-I love Kendall, and so do you, and I... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. But just maybe... be aware. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She feels like she's being left out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't let myself feel left out. You know? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She just wants to really hang out with everybody, you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I totally agree. But she does it to herself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I used to do that, as a kid. I'd put myself in a position just so people would feel bad for me. It's like a self-esteem type thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think Kendall is pretty sensitive, similar to me, and I kind of understand where she's coming from, and... it's sad, you know? And this is kind of what happens when you put a bunch of people in a house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, then we should pay attention to her more today. And make sure she's included. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I've been saying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I told her she could hang out with me more. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I include her in everything I do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like her way more than I like you, okay? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, she's just a sweeter girl. &gt;&gt; KYLIE; Yeah, I like Khloe way better, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall Jenner is in the house! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, guys. I hate to say good-bye, but I have to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you really? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Aw... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe's leaving, and there's not much more time on this vacation, and I was just hoping that this trip could kind of make up for lost time with me, Brandon and Brody, and I feel like that's not really happening. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I love you, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I'm gonna land in, like, 18 hours. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, e-mail me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, Khlo, my long-lost soul mate. My long-lost soul sister. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love, everyone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love you, Khlo. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Love you, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There goes the party! I am so sad to leave, but I have to go back to L.A. to be with Lamar. This family trip has been so much fun. I'm gonna drown. 678 00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,044 &gt;&gt; ALL: ...three! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! I'm in love with Santorini and Mykonos. Oh, bye, Greece. And as if I haven't YOLO'd enough, now I am taking a helicopter ride by myself back to Athens. Hi, I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; PILOT: Hello, Ms. Odom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, thank you. ♫ Ah! Thanks, you guys. This family trip has been one of the best, most memorable trips I've ever had. And I cannot wait to come back 689 00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,843 here with Lamar. It's truly heaven on earth. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would say, guys... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let's go surfing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...let's get up, get moving. You guys just want to go spend a little time? We can walk off breakfast. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'd like to probably take a nap, 'cause I didn't sleep for one second last night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, you didn't? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, no, it's hard to sleep on that couch, so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should've slept at the end of the bed. The bed doesn't even move. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not about that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because it's Tempur-Pedic. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not about that. It's like... I get anxious, thinking that I'm gonna, like, roll. Then it's like I freak out even more. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's like a slumber party. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, just, we're not two kids in junior high that need to have a slumber party, that right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think Scott is a little bit annoyed when he hears about the plans for the day. But, I mean, he just got here, and this is what we're all doing, so... He just needs to suck it up and try to have fun and see Greece with everyone. I just feel like we'll be annoyed if we don't do something active. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I won't be annoyed if I don't go. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! Let's go, let's go! I hate seeing my sister upset, so I'm gonna go ATVing and not invite anybody else. I don't know if that's the right 718 00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:49,220 thing to do, but that's... that's the only way I know. ♫ &gt;&gt; BRODY: I feel really bad for Kendall, because she was upset, and I hate seeing my sister upset. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ATVing and not invite anybody else. I don't know if that's the right thing to do, but that's... that's the only way I know. Hey! Let's go, let's go! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Now I'm ATVing with Brody, and this is kind of what I wanted, um, the vacation to be like. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I wanted the time with my brothers that I don't get to see that much. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hey. What are you doing? Why are you hanging out in here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Trying to get away a little bit. Have some alone time. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I know. But you're hiding. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I do that sometime. Only just 'cause... I just get, like, overwhelmed when there's so many people and there's so many different things going on. 738 00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,904 So, like, sometimes I just need, like, a minute alone. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How upset do you think your mom would be if Brody and I got my dad a putting green at the house? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's probably not 743 00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:28,420 the best idea, trying to go behind my mom's back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just get, like, overwhelmed when there's so many people and there's so many different things going on, so, like, sometimes I just need, like, a minute alone. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I mean, I understand. This is... My family is not like this. I don't have a big family. And you're an only child, right? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: It is overwhelming. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's overwhelming. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Like, sitting at the dinner table and trying to find words and, like, where do I fit in? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I do get it. I do understand. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And just imagine... that's every day. Not just vacations. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah, it is, huh? Kourtney doesn't directly come out and say, like, "Oh, I wish he would and I miss him," and all of these things, but I can kind of tell. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, well, she's just, you know, she's semi-cold. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Well, you did miss the first half of the trip. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know. I heard it was good, too. &gt;&gt; LEAH: And I saw Kourtney and she had... she was having a lot of fun, and, like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, she always does. &gt;&gt; LEAH: ...she pushed herself out of her own comfort zone and jumped in the water, screamed the entire time, and I know that she really would've liked to have done that with you. Now that you're here, you got to put something into it, and, like, show a little bit of love, and, like, be romantic. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, this is probably true. I kind of need to make up for lost time. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You do, you kind of need to make up for lost time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm ready to go. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Good. Come on. Let's go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I got to get out of this little cave. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look how cute are these little boats and stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's cool down here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at all these cats. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A lot of pussy in Santorini. Imagine if we just, like, moved here and, like, ran a little, like, mom and pop restaurant like this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would love it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like, you were, like, the hostess and I was the bartender. You know, I definitely feel a little guilty. Kourtney and I haven't really done much together. You know, I do have to say that I am with a wonderful person and I really appreciate that she knows me well enough to give me what I need sometimes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's beautiful here. I'm extremely happy to be at dinner with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like it's just... that's what it's about. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like this is a nice place to make memories. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're very delightful. I am glad that Scott and I got to have a night alone in Greece. I love having our time, you know, like that; I think it's important. And hopefully next time, he can come for a longer period or the whole trip. It's crazy how fast that just went down-- look. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That is kind of crazy. Should we kiss with the sunset? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's kiss, hold hands and jump into the water together. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I... 803 00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,620 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And say, "Wow!" at the sunset! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want to get a hammock like this at home? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I kind of... Yeah, I like it. Hey! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Brody and I wanted to ask you a question. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How upset do you think your mom would be if Brody and I got dad a putting green at the house? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce deserves to have a putting green at the house, but after all this progress that they've made, it's probably not the best idea, 816 00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:51,322 trying to go behind my mom's back. Captioning sponsored by Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How upset do you think your mom would be if Brody and I got dad a putting green at the house? We just don't feel like at this house he has... you know, he's got that little corner of the garage. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: And so we just kind of feel like, you know, he should have something that's a little bit more fun over at the house, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I'm into it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: So if you're on board, Khloe's on board, we're on board... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I feel like he needs something at this house that's, like, his. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. Our theory was though that he typically has more success when he asks for forgiveness rather than for permission. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, let's just do it then. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: So it's a win-win-win. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a win. You got my vote. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm amped that, uh, Kourtney and Khloe are on board. They actually have a better relationship with Kris. So, like, I need them. Kris will probably lose her mind though, huh? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That would drive her nuts if he was out there just all that... : Well... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey, hey, now! Hey! Okay, cool, so it's a deal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How thoughtful of you guys. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, no, we just want him to have... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I mean, I kind of want to just come over there and play on it, too. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Right. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Welcome to the Volcano View Villas. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She wore high heels, Brandon. Okay, over here? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Holy mother. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Brr... ation of the nation. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Wow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I told the guy I want the last serving before the sun goes out of sight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Cheers, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is the last night of our family vacation here in Greece. And what a beautiful spot to spend our last night. &gt;&gt; LEAH: See, that's cheese... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So it's just us, guys, at this long beautiful table? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, what happened to everybody? We used to have a big family. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: They're dropping. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brod never slept last night; he was up all night. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Well, Scott and Kourtney are having a romantic dinner at the hotel. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The fact that Rob is not here-- he would've enjoyed this so much. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yup, right, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. Hey-hey, yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: He's just thinking about his hair being blown in the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, the... my hair's getting blown in the wrong direction. What are you gonna do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We had this the other night, Brody and I. Did you have this the other night? Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that what you had the other night? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I love this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Was it last night? Seemed like a week ago. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Did Brody get drunk last night? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know, but he stayed up all night. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Did you get a little bit drunk last night? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, did I get a little bit drunk? No, I was just falling asleep. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Because at dinner you seemed a little bit drunk. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Like I do every time, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He got a little buzzed. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm having a lot of fun with my family and I feel so much better and now I'm having a great time with everyone. I mean, that's what vacations are all about-- being able to make memories. Opa! Oh, my God, that's so cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This has been such a magical vacation. I think for us it's really important to take these vacations because we really have to stop and think about how blessed we are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like that? Oh! Like that! Oh, yeah! Opa! Keeping Up with the Kardashians... What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a photo shoot I'm doing for Lam. &gt;&gt; KIM: An acrobatic latex shoot? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like a queef. &gt;&gt; BRODY: We're doing the putting green. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did Kris sign? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I like that. In this corner, sand trap. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Whoa! It's big, it's really big. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're manipulating this whole situation by the way that you paint a picture of me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I felt like I've lost control in the whole relationship and slowly trying to get it back.
