- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bernard, why are you so cute, booty face? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, it looks so perfect. Bernard! Okay, got a good one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! Creme de la creme! How was your swim meet? &gt;&gt; ROB: It was all right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Robby. &gt;&gt; ROB: Pretty good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; ROB: What's up with you, fat feet? &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't walk in and call someone fat feet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're making me very uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob gets scrutinized all the time in the media for his weight, so he really knows what it's like for me to feel the same thing. It's almost like now he's just in this different, darker space, to where he needs some kind of attention. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I'm gonna go jerk off for two hours. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: So don't bother me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: He has such anger for, like, no reason. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agree. &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't say or do one thing to him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You didn't. He definitely has anger issues. He needs to go to a psychologist. He cries at all times. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your dog is eating the, the wall. Maybe there's something in there that we don't know about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bernard, sit! Did he sit? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; RUSSELL JAMES: Um, good, good, good. Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my gosh! Kendall! I know that shot. &gt;&gt; JAMES: You know this shot. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love it, Russell, seriously. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It seems like just yesterday that Kendall and Kylie were little girls, and they've just been amazing with their careers and the way they have the most incredible work ethic, and they're really 35 00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,709 passionate about what they're doing right now. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hello. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Nice to meet you. All right, well, let's go sit down. So I know Sarah asked you just a little bit, but what is it about acting? Like, what is it that's so exciting to you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Even when I was younger, like, me and my sister, we put together these movies. I enjoy doing things with Kendall, but sometimes it's fun to just do things on your own. And I've always had an interest in acting. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What's your name? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kylie Jenner. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's gonna do one little show with us. What is the show called? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: "Butt Dance." It's for my daddy! It's so cool! Look! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Steps. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: When you are in an audition situation... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: ...you're given no props. All you get is the chair. Then you use this. You just disarm them, because no actors do that. They come in, and they just think it's enough to sit in a 57 00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:41,261 chair and say the lines. It's not. Just maybe go for it. &gt;&gt; JAMES: Kendall is so coming into her own, like, as a legitimate supermodel, in my humble opinion. She could be alongside anyone: Karlie Kloss, Candace Swanepoel so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, that means a lot coming from you, since you work with all of them. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My ultimate dream is to one day become a high-fashion model, and that's kind of what I'm working to. And Russell James is trying to help me, so I'm excited to be working with him. &gt;&gt; JAMES: I would say Kendall has unlimited potential. 69 00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,631 It's immediate and it's sort of happening now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so OCD. I open up my refrigerator, the string cheese is in, like the, like, in the normal shelf. If you don't want me to know that you're bingeing on string cheese, why wouldn't you put it back in the cheese drawer? So then I go to his room with Jen and Joyce, and we go up there, and we're, like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ..."Rob, what have you done this morning?" And he locks the door, then he says he's jacking off and he can't answer the door. It's, like, the whole thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who has the time to jack off? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Yeah? Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: I need you to come pick me up, please. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For what, Rob? &gt;&gt; ROB: I went on a run, and when I got back, my car was gone. So, obviously, I was in the, like, trash Tuesday. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't run. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm being serious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, where'd you, where'd you go on a run? &gt;&gt; ROB: Sherman Oaks, where I go every day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, I'm not dealing with this right now. I'm with Mom and Kourt and Kim, we're having lunch. With Rob, you really never know when he's telling the truth or not. Everything is a joke. &gt;&gt; ROB: I have one kid in Miami. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You have a kid? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. I really want to get these gold bottom teeth. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna jewel your teeth? &gt;&gt; MAN: How old are you? &gt;&gt; ROB: Um, just turned 21. &gt;&gt; MAN: Just turned 21? &gt;&gt; KIM: 26. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If my car got towed, I'd call Triple A. &gt;&gt; ROB: Seriously, I'm not playing. Pick me up. I... really. I'm not going to walk home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, you're such a liar-- bye. He is such a phony baloney. He calls me, like, at 2:00 in the morning. "Khloe, I just got arrested! This is my one phone call!" Trust me, this is all for 106 00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,426 attention, guys. This isn't real. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 1: Hi. Corporate America. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How are you? &gt;&gt; WOMAN 1: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 1: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: As you can see, we just put up the summer stuff on the wall over there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, this skirt looks so cute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall and I have our own clothing line, so today we are just going over designs and clothes and all that. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 1: So we'll just go by style on the line sheet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 1: So just a basic easy racer. Do you guys want it to be longer? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I like the length. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But, like, to wear it with leggings or something. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You could wear that with leggings. Why couldn't you wear that with leggings? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 'Cause your crotch is showing. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Then the next one is the tieback romper. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wow, it looks great. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just want to see if we can make this one muted. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I would wear it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: All right, girls, we're all done. Thanks so much. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Okay, I want to talk about some stuff we have coming up. So you're gonna do that taping. And then a couple other offers we have coming up is there's that bathing suit line. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, I don't want to do that. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Uh! Okay, why? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause that's what I'm trying to stay away from. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Not as commercial? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, exactly. I want it to be... I'm trying to go for the whole high-fashion thing. I just can't... Like, I don't want that to ruin it. I feel bad sometimes that I have to do turn down photo shoots with me and Kylie and stuff. And I know my time in fashion is limited, so that's kind of what I gotta do. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Your mom thinks it's a good idea, and the agent... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, who cares? That's why you and her are doing it, yeah. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Okay, I need to know that from you so I know how to, like, push back on it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, my mom comes to you and asks you, then just say no; "She said no." &gt;&gt; LIZ: Okay, all right, then we'll do that. You're gonna be busy this summer. 150 00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,296 Be ready. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No bueno. Plastico, plastico. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, plastic. You got me there. Glass. Because plastic has chemicals. : I got it. Go green. Everyone go green. Go green. : Mom, he eats his own, literally. And you're letting him lick your mouth. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's make out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Robert! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You weren't stuck after all. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, actually, I took a cab home 'cause you all are dickheads, who, four of you couldn't pick me up. This is reallyup that all you guys think I was lying, didn't come pick me up. You all suck. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would have thought that if you needed a ride, I would have been there to give you a ride. &gt;&gt; ROB: I called you and told you guys! So get out out of here! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're always... and constantly twisting the truth. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's not about that. It's about you guys don't take me seriously. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's about you twisting the truth, so that when you do call with a problem, we're not quite sure what to believe. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. Whatever. I get I kid around all the time and I joke around all the time, but, like, at the end of the day, I was trying to tell them I'm stranded. And no one's kind of there for me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're full of most of the time, and that's exactly why this is happening to you right now. And if you ever really do need us and you're serious, then you'll tell us the truth! &gt;&gt; ROB: You do not even pay attention to half the things I tell you, so you wouldn't know what's true or not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, see, this car thinks it's going! Kylie is probably the worst driver. You didn't even look over to to your left before you got in the next lane. Like, it's really scary. Go slow! &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're gonna press charges? &gt;&gt; ROB: They said, "What do you think you're doing? This is private property. This is our business." She's mad that she didn't get a picture. &gt;&gt; ROB: You do not even pay attention to half the things I tell you, so you wouldn't know what's true or not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, your problem is that you baby him. &gt;&gt; KIM: He is the most irrational human alive and I bet his car is in the front 198 00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,397 driveway. Go look. I bet his car's here. 201 00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,071 &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not... I'm telling you it's not here. His car is definitely not here. 204 00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,648 &gt;&gt; KIM: He deserves to try and figure it out on his own. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie and I, we have a photo shoot. And it's the direction I'm trying to go, so I'm really excited. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay, girls, the day won't wait on you if you don't move along. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am getting my makeup done and Kylie is sitting there taking pictures of herself. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay, Kylie, you got to start getting dressed. Come on. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Let's get up. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, go. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall... I will hit you in the throat. &gt;&gt; STYLIST: Do you guys beat each other up sometimes? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We used to. I feel like Kylie and I are at different places in our life right now. And I get really irritated with her because she's kind of immature. 221 00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,071 And she's just being so disrespectful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Kendall, how's it going? Tell me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Great. Kylie was being annoying though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She literally sat in the makeup chair for, like, 30 minutes taking pictures of herself while we're all waiting for her, like, when we got to get things going. Liz... then finally when Liz, like, yelled at her, she started doing stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. Kendall and Kylie have been just bickering nonstop. They're teenagers. They're coming into their own individual selves. I think it's natural. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Oh, they're on together right now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, guys, it's Kylie. We're here... and Kendall. We're here... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like the angel and the devil. I heard Kylie, like, wouldn't get out of the makeup chair, Kendall said. &gt;&gt; LIZ: They're just... they have such different styles... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; LIZ: I mean, if it's, like, a modeling job, Kendall's, like, focused. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Whereas Kylie, it's just part of the beast. Like, oh, I have a clothing line, oh, I have this and, like, this is part of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think they're still into it. I just think when it comes to modeling and stuff, Kendall is, like, obsessed with it. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Kendall wants it to be her life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. 249 00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,535 &gt;&gt; LIZ: And I don't think she's gonna have a problem with that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I said, "Hello." Whoa, your boobs are looking nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They are nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: "Volumptuous." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All righty. So, remember that I was practicing racing when I was in Florida? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And now Chapman is saying there might actually be an opportunity for me to, like, really race cars and make, like, a career out of it. So I'm excited. I mean, that's, like, huge news. Since I was a little kid, I've always been extremely passionate about racing cars. I just know that I'd like to try to see where it takes me. I'd have to fly to this one racing school just to be able to, like, get my racing license. You know, there's a ton of responsibility and a ton of work that would have to go into it, but at the same time, it's, like, something I've always wanted. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I've always heard you talk about it. I'm not happy about Scott racing, but I see he wants to do it so badly, so I really don't think that I should prevent him from, you know, following one of his dreams. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, I'm not gonna be the best at first, but I guess I got to try. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sorry, I was e-mailing about the wallpaper. Did you notice that it's put up there temporarily? Check it out-- I'm a wallpaper addict. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, I'm gonna go try to be a race car driver. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Check it out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You become a wallpaper addict. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I already am a wallpaper addict. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pow! That's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, this thing is amazing. &gt;&gt; JEFF: You haven't been... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi! &gt;&gt; JEFF: You haven't been to this location, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at how weird those chairs are. I don't know what Kanye's style is, so I'm taking a picture of everything weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are something else. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, how annoying has Rob been lately? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Literally all he does is complain and come up with excuse after excuse and it's always, like, fake. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Obviously it goes a little bit deeper for him, emotionally, than you even know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My point exactly. You'll do a quick fix by, like, buying him a suit 'cause he says he has no clothes to wear, but that doesn't help somebody's, 297 00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:38,785 like, emotional, deep, getting down to the root of the problem. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I felt bad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need to help... You should, but we... &gt;&gt; KRIS: But he's your brother, and obviously... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And he's your son. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I'm saying that for your son, maybe you should go to see a therapist and just tell her all the things 305 00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:59,138 that he's been going through. Maybe she'll have some insight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: As a mom, I'll do anything that it takes to get Rob back to a really good place. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can we shop? &gt;&gt; KIM: I actually think it's a good idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would go even if it was just to explain him to somebody and then get him some help, but on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; KIM: Jeff, this is like my horn chair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, you're making me 314 00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,429 horny, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's not a mop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I will not do this, Kylie. Stop pressuring me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please don't kill each other. I don't feel like going to the emergency room tonight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, get over yourself. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, Mom, I'll see you later. Kylie, out of all of us, is probably the worst driver. She definitely needs extra driving hours. I definitely am the only brave one to go ahead and put my life literally in her hands. Do you know what a rolling stop sign is? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes. Do you want me to do it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know they call them "California stops"? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause Californians do that &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I believe that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my... What is happening? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Who was that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you look...? You didn't even look over to your left before you got in the next lane, Kylie! What if there was a motorcyclist? I don't know what she's thinking while she's dri... like, she's... oh, my God. I can't even envision her having a real license. Like, it's really scary. &gt;&gt; KYLIE:..This person's trying to... go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hold on. No, no. Why are you rushing? No, see, this car thinks it's going! If I die... I died for a good cause. Go slower... Kylie! You got to relax a little. Do not answer that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can I answer that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nope. Hello? Hey, Stas. It's Stas, she wants to know if you want to go to dinner tonight. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Sure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She said, "Sure." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ask her what time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What time? Okay, bye, Stas. She says she's coming to get you at 7:00. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Or do you want to invite Kendall? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Honestly... 357 00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:09,168 right now I just feel like I need a break from Kendall. As Kendall and I are getting older, as an older sister, I think she just puts a lot of pressure on me. And sometimes I just need to hang out with my friends alone, and she needs to do the same. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We all get on each other's nerves, but you guys have to work around it. I don't think by distancing yourselves too much is the right way to go. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: In her mind, I'm supposed to listen to whatever she says. But it's, like, you're also not my mom. Like, I'm not gonna listen to whatever you say. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where's Kylie? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, she just left with Stas to get sushi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Why? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I asked her to go to dinner and she said, "No, I'm gonna stay home." It's so annoying. She doesn't care about you, she doesn't care about me, she doesn't care about anyone in this family anymore. Now I have to go to dinner alone? She only thinks of herself. I can't... deal. 379 00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:21,507 &gt;&gt; KRIS: You want to go to dinner with me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is up with you guys alienating Kendall? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The tension is turned up a notch in this house. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe, Kylie is flipping out on me and she has no reason to flip out on me. &gt;&gt; MAURICIO: My name is Mauricio. I've been carting for five years now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know anybody here. I'm the odd man out. It's the worst. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that you could really benefit from talking to somebody. &gt;&gt; ROB: You think I need help, that's your opinion. Isn't gonna happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Rob. What's going on? Is it really pressing charges? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Somebody's pressing charges? Who's on the phone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hold on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: First of all, they said, "What do you think you're doing?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob calls me in a panic to tell me that a paparazzi had popped up out of nowhere and started taking pictures of Robert on private property. So they're gonna press charges because they're gonna say you robbed somebody, and it's battery? &gt;&gt; ROB: She's mad that she didn't get a picture. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just keep your chin up, baby. 'Cause you know what? People are just gonna try and bring you down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's another situation. It's abad day. 408 00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,762 &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I love you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yep. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Ow! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Show him your tattoo I gave you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Lamar. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm not looking at her stomach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's on her arm. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This doesn't look appetizing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need to explain this to you. Cuban food-- I'm gonna teach you how to eat it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I really don't think I can eat that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so what is up with you guys alienating Kendall? Tell me why. Stas, you go first, 'cause I can scare you into telling me the truth. &gt;&gt; ANASTASIA: I always... No, I always say let's hang out with Kendall. Let's invite Kendall. But whenever we invite her, she says no. So we just stopped inviting her. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She says no all the time, or leaves early and makes us leave early. So she's just not, she doesn't want to be there when we force her to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, what do you guys think the problem is? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. What made you say let's get this 431 00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,219 instead of, like, Chinese or something? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sorry I'm about ten minutes late. &gt;&gt; MAN: That's all right. We'll get you a seat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So I'm here at racing school, and of course, my flight was delayed, so I'm already late. And that's already bothering me. I was so excited I could barely sit still on the plane. And then to be delayed and sit on the runway, it's, like, what's next? &gt;&gt; MAN 2: In my last year of carting, I was ready to progress. I decided to go into full-size cars. And I built a GTS street race car. &gt;&gt; MAURICIO: My name is Mauricio. I've been carting for five years now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: In this racing school, I don't know anybody here. The past few times I have been in race cars, I've at least had some support or a friend with me. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: I was in a speed 30 coming down turn three, but I was really wide. I went off the track. &gt;&gt; MAN 3: Good for you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I get nervous. I mean, it's like going to a new school and not knowing anybody. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Um, my name is Scott. I live in L.A. I've done very little carting. I've been in a couple race cars for, you know, a minute or two, and sat around for about ten hours. And that's about it. I'd like to try to gain as much skill as possible in the least amount of time. &gt;&gt; MAN 4: Okay, we're out here with driving gear. Leave everything else here and head out that door without your stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you have a suit I can grab? &gt;&gt; MAN 4: Yeah, sure. Yeah. Hey. You might have to wait a little bit. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. No one really filled me in on what I'm doing here exactly. Everybody brought their own helmets and their own shoes. &gt;&gt; MAN 5: Yeah, we got one more straggler here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just feel like the odd man out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you walk like this? Like I'm frolicking? &gt;&gt; KIM: You're the biggest, oddest person alive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The biggest?! &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, the most oddest. Bible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yello. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe, Kylie is being so annoying. I'm going on ski trip, so I needed ski pants, and I went down to, like, the universal closet downstairs where, like, everybody has all their ski stuff, and I took pants, put them in my room. And she went in my room when I wasn't there... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ...took them, and now won't let me use them. And she's flipping out on me. And she has no reason to flip out on me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When it comes to Kendall and Kylie, I am definitely called for any fight, tiff, disagreement, whatever. I always have to be the peacemaker. And I definitely know that the tension is turned up a notch in this house. Okay, hold on one second, okay? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know what you're about to say. I know what Kendall said, and it's not true. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Did you take Kendall's pants? pants. &gt;&gt; KIM: And why do you care? They're ski pants. You're in California. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She's literally being crazy. She said, "I'm going to grab this knife and stab you multiple times in the throat." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We got to be not so crazy over ski pants. And you're not even going skiing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I gotta go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, excuse me. You don't need to be rude to me. I'm the mediator. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm not being rude to you. I just need to pee and I want to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sopee in your little white snow pants, you little bitch. &gt;&gt; BENNY: No cell phones at race car school! Come on! &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, Benny, quit distracting my students. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm hoping that I calm down once I get into a car and get into my zone, I guess you'd say, and everything will be okay from there. &gt;&gt; BENNY: Are you in group one or group two? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Group two. &gt;&gt; BENNY: You guys will probably head to the classroom here in a little bit. &gt;&gt; MAN: Start 'er up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All I wanted to do was get through this racing school, but it just didn't feel like a comfortable environment or situation for me. I mean, there's a reason I didn't like school. And this is one of them. Hey, doll. I'm actually going to be coming home. I thought I was gonna be able to deal with this class, but it's just, like, not for me. So I will see you in a couple 525 00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:39,044 of hours. Love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, I am getting blamed for all your things, and I'm done with it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You stress me out and you give me anxiety. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Robert has to turn himself in and be arrested, literally. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Want me to open it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I already had one beer, honey. This is my second beer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Second beer? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think, I think it's a two-beer night. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, how embarrassing. It smells so delish. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hello. Look at you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm having all the family over for dinner tonight, and I think my favorite night of the week is definitely family dinner. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are we digging in? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah? You know what I was just thinking? Do you still have your tattoo of your ex? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A couple of exes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you still have a tattoo of your ex. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That thing's going very soon. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mine's, like, in the middle of my stomach. Like, literally, like, my whole stomach. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The weirdest thing happened. Scott went to qualify for this car racing thing. He was, like, freaked out. He's, like, "I just can't deal with people. I hate people." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's a big deal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And now he left. I feel bad for him. I mean, he's literally on his way home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe he has performance anxiety. Like he doesn't want to do it in front of them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He said he had social anxiety. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get him to grow up, okay? He's a big boy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a mental problem. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If that's the case, tell him to give up on the racing thing, because you can't have social anxiety and race cars. 563 00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:25,050 &gt;&gt; ROB: How could Lord Disick have social anxiety? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every morning I have a routine. I soak the dishes from the teenagers that don't clean up their own mess. It's like a bunch of people that were born in a barn. Kendall, I am so tired of you guys doing this to the kitchen. It's, like, crazy. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's all Kylie, Mom. I... She stays up with her friends till 2:00 in the morning and I'm never down here. I'm dead asleep in my room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't sleep because there is a party out there every night... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's not me, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you guys can help me clean up this mess, because I'm not gonna do it... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, I'm not cleaning anything up. I'll go tell Kylie. Kylie does this to me all the time, and it's really frustrating. 'Cause she's kind of immature. I feel like I'm way more responsible than her and I get really irritated with her and I can't deal with it. Kylie, you have to go downstairs and clean up the mess, 'cause I'm not gonna get blamed for anything that you do anymore. You're the one that's up all night long, that sits down there and makes messes with your friends while I'm asleep. So you have to go clean it up. And I am getting blamed for all your things. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall, you stress me out. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And I'm done with it. You stress me out, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Everything we do, you give me anxiety. All you do is tell me what to do, tell me what to order, tell me not to keep my shower on, tell me this, tell me that. Like, do I really need my sister that's a year and a half older than me coming and yelling at me, acting like my mom? No. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall tells me what to do too often, and everything that I do pisses her off. She loves to, like, be my mom. I just, like, don't need to be put down all the time. This is one of the reasons we don't hang out. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm getting blamed for all of your stuff. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, so chill. Go in your room, hang out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, okay, okay. Okay. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: All you do is act like a brat and I always get blamed for it, and I'm honestly over it, so I'm gonna leave. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Happy, happy sisters. Okay. I mean, are you going to apologize to Kendall? 'Cause she has a point. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm so sorry Mom yelled at you, like, what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh! But you should be on her team, sister. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She's not on my team, sister. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys need to get on each other's team. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Honestly, let's just drop it. I'm over it. 614 00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,061 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like when you guys are sister-sister. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doll? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, what happened? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was unbelievable. I, like, don't even know how to explain what went on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think regardless of the racing, the fact that this was such a dream of his and that he had no choice but to drop it, because of his anxiety, like, I just want him to fix this and figure out what the problem is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. I just get so paranoid. The last thing I wanted to do was be around all these people I didn't know, and... couldn't handle it. I said my small little profile on myself of my name, where I'm from, and I don't know. I felt like some people were, like, even giggling, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you just walk out of the class? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I felt like I had to get out of there before I freaked out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, now what? Can you not do the racing thing at all? I mean, all I've been hearing you talk about is wanting to do that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. It's just... just didn't feel right. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want a piece? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, no. Because I'll want to eat all of it and I'm on a diet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Which one should I do the macaroni in? This one? Or this one? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That... The one on... That one. &gt;&gt; KIM: This one? Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Todd Wilson, the attorney, who says that Robert has to turn himself in and be arrested, literally, and post bail. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because they're saying that this photographer, who was on private property, is pressing charges and the DA has decided to go ahead and arrest him. Rob seems to be at a really bad place, just emotionally. He's really fragile right now. And anytime you experience this sort of thing with your child, it's heartbreaking. KRIS: Just call me as soon as you're done, okay? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'll call you when I'm done. The police filed, uh, a warrant for my arrest. Nobody really understands what's going on. And it's kind of just messing with all of our emotions and I'm definitely nervous. &gt;&gt; MAN: So, why are you worried? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like I am not a good enough mom. &gt;&gt; ROB: After the incident with the paparazzi, the police filed, uh, a warrant for my arrest. I'm meeting my lawyer at the courthouse, and then go up in front of the judge. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Rob, I don't really... Like, those look like jail slacks. That looks like the outfit they give you... with no hat. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You're out? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: So tell Bob I said hello. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What happened? &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh, nothing. I'm just about to park, so I'll call you when I get out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, honey. &gt;&gt; ROB: Nobody really understands what's going on, and it's kind of just messing with all our emotions and... I obviously see all the kinds of nasty things people say, and, like, do I listen to them? No. But does it hurt? Of course it hurts. And I'm definitely nervous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you ready for this? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah! Yeah! Hey! I was never a cheerleader, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you ever been here? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, a hundred times. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe wanted to secretly bring Kendall and Kylie together because they have not been getting along, and I think none of us can just sit back and let them drift apart-- we need to make sure, as their older sisters, that they stay best friends, like, you know, Kim and Khloe and I are. Hey, Kyles! What do you know? What do you say? What do you say? What do you know? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am so annoyed that Kylie's here right now. Like, I can't believe no one told me she was gonna be here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you excited Kendall's here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm doing some serious business. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It ruined my entire day with my other sisters. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know you guys really don't want to listen to me, but let me just say this. How you guys act towards each other's the same way that Kourtney and Kim acted towards one another. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like we were a lot alike growing up, to where we would fight all the time. And then, like, Khloe would try and tag along, and we would be, like, "Ugh! Our little sister is so annoying." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just 'cause you're sisters doesn't mean you have to be friends, but we've all chosen to be best friends 'cause we respect... envy, love and honor one another, just like you two do, deep down. There'll be no other friend like your sister. Why don't you two hug it out, and let's go jump it out. Aw... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Even though Kendall and I haven't been able to get along lately and we used to be much closer... &gt;&gt; YOUNG KYLIE: Hey, Kendall, Bendall! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...no one is ever gonna take the place of my sister. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw... A little caress. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie and I are going our different ways, but that's okay. And I know that we're always gonna be sisters, so she'll always be there, and eventually, it'll all patch itself up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, don't do that! Tell her not to jump. It's scaring me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim, stop! Kim! Kim! I'm serious! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, you almost fell, like, four times. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I found some. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How cute! Ah. Who is this? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, no, that's you. That's your face. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you sure? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. Look at that face-- that's you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm definitely taking pictures of this and posting it online. Will you help me out, Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. Oh, dreamy. I was such a model. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh! My God. I wasn't even that cute. Like, if I honestly had a kid and it looked like that, like, I wouldn't be, like, "You're the cutest thing ever. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes, you would. You were really cute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you done? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. Bob was definitely on top of his, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did they arrest you? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, he avoided an arrest and everything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And you weren't booked or did you have your... did you have a-a mug shot taken? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, we avoided all that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. I even sl... I even slicked back my hair. &gt;&gt; ROB: What are you doing? Are you crying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why are you crying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I've just been really upset all morning about this whole thing. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, I hate to see my mom cry, and my family's, like, trying to be there for me. They're trying to help me out, but I'm the only one that can help myself. Thank God I didn't have to, you know, get booked and, uh, go through that, since we have, you know... we got Bob on our side and everything, and everything was good and... dealt with everything fine, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. 754 00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,770 I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. Hello. I'm Kris. I'm meeting with a therapist to try to figure out what's really going on with Rob and figure out a way to help him deal with his issues. Thanks for coming over. &gt;&gt; THOMAS: My pleasure. So-so, why are you worried? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm worried because I feel like I am not a good enough mom where I can't figure this out myself. Like, why can't I help my son get it together? &gt;&gt; THOMAS: Just so you know, that doesn't work. Your kids are gonna suffer, like all human beings are gonna go through pain, and moms can't be responsible for everything that goes on in life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; THOMAS: It's important to say, "I need help." Part of your journey is to know that sometimes you're powerless about things. You know, they got to want it more than you. You can't get someone out of depression. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He got in this altercation, and so they were going to arrest him this morning. And then we had to hire Bob Shapiro, the attorney, and they didn't arrest him. When he was telling me he wasn't arrested, I literally burst into tears. I just thought that's when he would crack. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Everybody's always looking at me to fail, not looking at me to, like, win, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not about what other people think, and I'm here to help you, babe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that you could really benefit from talking to somebody. &gt;&gt; ROB: Whatever you're trying 785 00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:20,331 to do and say and bring up isn't gonna happen. &gt;&gt; THOMAS: So think about this, what's going on. You're worrying about him a lot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; THOMAS: And he knows you're worrying about him a lot. The best thing you can have for him right now is faith that he's gonna figure it out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I try not to let him feel my... panic, you know, 'cause I do feel very, um... I feel scared. &gt;&gt; THOMAS: Yeah. You're doing the same thing he's doing, which is you're trying to hold it together, not show him your-your fear... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; THOMAS: ...and I'm sure he's doing the same thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob needs somebody to talk to, to help him be consistently happy. &gt;&gt; THOMAS: I will help him to help himself. I don't fix people, but I'm there to guide them to fix themselves. But does Rob want to do this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, I want to take a photo. Instagram-y. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, 'Gram time. Um, I was gonna tell you, I feel like I never really, like, told you everything that happened with the racing stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Chapman's asked me what I'm gonna do with it, and the last thing I want to do is, like, jump into a race car and God forbid I wasn't the best. Then I'm, like, the biggest loser. Like, "Oh, look, Scott thinks he's a big shot and can just jump into a race car." Everybody's always looking at me to fail and not looking at me to, like, win, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The thing is, is that it's your life. It's not about what other people think. It's all about experiences and trying things and, you know, failing and then jumping up and doing something again. It's not about what anyone else thinks about you. You care way too much what other people think. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, have you seen the cars, and the stuff I wear? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, but you need to not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wish I didn't. It's just... it's scary, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: YOLO. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know what I got to do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? 825 00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:34,265 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to open up these wings and I got to fly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob, are you gonna start your workout today? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, with Lamar and Robbie. Lamar's probably gonna get good rest, start to get a good week. Hey, isn't it good though that he's starting only a week day... like, he only had a week off and he's going right back into it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. No, it's amazing. I think that it... that shows a lot of self-discipline. &gt;&gt; ROB: He got into shape during last season, and then he was playing like he was out of shape, so he needs to, like, end on a... &gt;&gt; KRIS: But don't you think that that's a really good lesson in that we can learn from what goes wrong and we try to correct it? You know, we all have those times in our life where things don't go the way that we want them to go, and our mood swings go up and down and we become not as strong. I think that you could really benefit-- and just hear me out-- from talking to somebody. I've kind of done a little bit of that homework for you and a little bit of that due diligence. His name's Tom and, you know what, he was the coolest guy. &gt;&gt; ROB: So what, are we gonna go hang out, be friends? You think I need help-- that's your opinion. This person thinks they can teach me to do something... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think you need help, I think you could use... &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't buy any of that I'm smart enough to understand what's going on. Whatever you're trying to do and 853 00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:06,691 say and bring up isn't gonna happen.

You just spend a lot of time in that room, and that is a sign, to me, of somebody who's not extremely happy and maybe a little bit depressed. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm good. I don't need to see anybody. I'm cool. I guarantee you, a year from now, I'll be in the happiest place of my life, feeling good all around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I care what's going on in your heart and in your head. I'm here for you. I don't want you to sit up there in your room and be, you know, dark. I care about what's going on inside, okay? &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I never want to give up on any of my children, but at the same time, I can't make him do something like this unless he wants to help himself. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get out of here. I can't pee in there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, you're ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've got to pee! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, when you do baby stuff, you guys don't talk to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't that cute? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I could so jump off a ledge somewhere. Let's do something to Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We could TP her house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, hurry! Let's go, let's go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who TP'd my house? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, vandalizing my house.
