- Keeping Up With The Kardashians: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm trying to stay as calm as possible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have something called toxemia. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: Basically, I have to deliver the baby today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bad things could 9 00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,986 happen if this gets out of control. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just got an I.V. and it really hurts. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel more anxious was in labor. 14 00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,531 &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't wait to meet you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think I should get rid of this dress? Like, I'll never wear it again, right? Everyone seemed to make fun of me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I loved it. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was on the cover of The cover. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I loved it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Saying "What the Frock?" Okay, let's go in that other room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Kay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, do you want to see what I bought? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: This was what, collectively, what Kanye and I bought together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here's the bunny I got you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you like her? &gt;&gt; KIM: Love it. Like, that's the kind of dolls I want. How cute is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Blue, though? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, like, it's denim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: We like this vibe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, I love that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like this is how my kid will dress, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, very Celine-baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love this. &gt;&gt; KIM: How long until the belly button falls off? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe a month. &gt;&gt; KIM: He had no idea about the bell button thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Doesn't Leah look good? Dresses up well. And, in, but what I like about that. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'm sick of doing her makeup for her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I like it that we beat, uh, Dunham here. We don't want to hold him up. You know, it's like our fault that we, you know, put him late. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Right. &gt;&gt; BRODY: All of us are in Vegas to check out my dad's new "best friend." This Jeff Dunham that we hear all about. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I told you I got a new best friend. His name is Jeff Dunham. You're gonna love him. You gotta go over to see Dunham's. He's got a whole collection of cars. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, you're obsessed with this guy. I haven't seen my dad have a friend, even, for a very long time. I'm curious to see Bruce hang out with his boy. Look at, he gets all giddy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We spent a long time together. We're gonna have a good time. &gt;&gt; AUDREY: Hey guys. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, you're not nervous doing the show tonight with me and my kids and all that? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Nope, because security's been told to shoot you on sight if you do anything wrong, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, so, okay. God gave me fast feet. &gt;&gt; JEFF: I've heard that. I was too young, I don't remember. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's true. The only difference between 51 and 63? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you like to pee? &gt;&gt; JEFF: That's a weird question coming from a guy who's touching me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The only thing, he doesn't play golf. If he'd played golf I'd marry him, I think. &gt;&gt; WAITER: The espresso and cappuccino? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You gonna go with the coffee? I'm trying to stay up past 10:00. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: By midnight, he'll be up in the DJ booth, amping all the crowd up. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Uh... we should be getting going pretty quick. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; LEAH: See you soon. Break a leg. &gt;&gt; JEFF: See you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, shut the ... up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hit me, that's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like your bike. &gt;&gt; MAN: Khloe. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, it's always fun when Khloe and I do any kind of outings. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yo, Lord Disick! Man, jump in this Man, come on! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, L.D. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's fun running around and seeing the streets. Excuse me, do you know where the 101 is? &gt;&gt; DRIVER: Oh, Highland, take a left, go up, you'll hit, you'll hit 101. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you, doll. &gt;&gt; DRIVER: Hey, no worries. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Bye. Continue dating your She washis &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's ... awesome! Oh, she was a hooker! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She washis , dude. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, Hollywood's unreal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. Make a... what is this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That guy was totally getting hisoff. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. What... &gt;&gt; TIM: How are you? My name is Tim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi Tim. I'm Khloe, this is Scott. &gt;&gt; TIM: You remind me of a beautiful genie. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How long have you been living on the street? &gt;&gt; TIM: I've been staying out here for about a year and a half. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And why'd you choose to live on the streets? &gt;&gt; TIM: Um, it was a choice from my spiritual activist work. My husband, he-he gives such, he smokes things. And, you know... My children are... are, are, they are gonna be crack children. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would they be crack children? &gt;&gt; TIM: My mother was a crack girl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TIM: But I'm just very blessed. I'm very, very blessed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Amen, sister. Nice meeting you. God bless. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's so weird to think, like, how much else is out there that you have no idea what's going on. &gt;&gt; JEFF: So how's your wife? &gt;&gt; ACHMED: You mean wivesssss? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Have you asked any other women out lately? &gt;&gt; ACHMED: Yes, she said, "Maybe, if you're the last guy on Earth." I said, "I'mworking on it!" &gt;&gt; JEFF: We are honored here this evening to have Bruce Jenner and his sons Brody and Brandon as well as, uh, Brandon's wife, Leah. Right over here. Right over there, over there, over there. There they are, there they are. &gt;&gt; WALTER: Bruce has had more work done on his face than I did when you built me. &gt;&gt; WALTER: I'm not kidding, Bruce comes to Vegas just to see how much better he turned out than Barry Manilow's face. &gt;&gt; BRODY: To me, it's a little awkward to watch Jeff Dunham lay into my dad. I know my that dad made a big deal about Jimmy Fallon coming after him the way he did. Maybe it doesn't bother him, but I think it's possible that he's acting like it doesn't bother him because it is a new friendship. &gt;&gt; WALTER: Bruce, that wasn't too bad, was it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No! &gt;&gt; WALTER: No? Okay, good. Glad you're here, you been having fun, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; WALTER: Good, keep drinking, 143 00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,793 &gt;&gt; DJ: PURE Nightclub, let's make some noise for Bruce Jenner! &gt;&gt; BRODY: My dad is very by-the-book. It's very hard to get him to open up and have fun. I mean, I've tried to do it for years. 150 00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,315 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Jeffy, up here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I need a shot. &gt;&gt; BRODY: But he's having fun, and it's nice to see him let loose. 155 00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,165 He needs a shot. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can feel it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: This is awesome, to see my dad take tequila shots. And I hope that he's doing it because he actually wants to and 160 00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,350 he's not just trying to impress his new best friend Jeff. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's have more 163 00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,094 tequila! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so cute. I think this goes on her back and not as a headband, just so you know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, it goes on her back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is cute. &gt;&gt; ROB: I wish I was this waist size. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you don't. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I'm kidding. I don't. That's, like, my penis size. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew, guys, stop. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you gonna let them, doll, talk about penis sizes in front of Melanie's clothes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If I'd said that, I'd be, like, kicked out of the house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It would be a good banana hammock. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so, did Scott tell you about our, um, our excursion? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, what excursion? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott and I made a friend. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He admitted that he was a crack baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, he said his mom was a crack fiend. He's a crack baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't, everything you're saying is going in one ear and out the other. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, I have a desire to get deeper into these lives. Dad used to take us to skid row all the time. And do, like, drive down and do that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why do you even care? I've just never even known someone like that, so it's just hard for me to relate. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just because it's not, like, a legitimate charity, like, people need help, too. Where is skid row from here? Like, how do these people get in these situations? I don't feel like it's appropriate. You're crashing on their space. This is home. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Dunham's on the road. I miss him. He texted me his schedule. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, you got his schedule-- you can stalk him. &gt;&gt; BRODY: My dad might be coming on a little too strong. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think I'm scaring him off. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have something called toxemia. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: My liver is shutting down, so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! But is that... safe? 204 00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,346 &gt;&gt; KIM: Basically, I have to deliver the baby today. â™« &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, my God. Look at him right now. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: He made it! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Group hug. Group hug. Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's a Jenner hug. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's going down right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't think I've ever seen you wear a hat. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Something a little different. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's Brody's look. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your girlfriend seems to be very nice. A little quiet. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Very quiet. I'd rather quiet than the opposite. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, well, that's true. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, speaking of girlfriends... how's-how's your girlfriend doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Dunham. Jeff. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, Dunham! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Khloe told me that Bruce made a penguin for Jeff Dunham at Color Me Mine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Think I should do this penguin? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Penguins are primarily black, aren't they? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, does anyone else think it's weird that he's making this for that Jeff guy? &gt;&gt; BRODY: He's like a giddy schoolboy. I don't know if I'd do that. He might scare Jeff away. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Dunham's fine. He's on the road, I miss him. It's summertime, he's working. He texted me his schedule. It was just ridiculous. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Now you've got his schedule, you can stalk him. What if that's his way of breaking up with you? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Texting you his schedule... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's that? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: "This is what I've got going on." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's a good guy. &gt;&gt; BRODY: We just know you really like him, and we don't want you scaring him off. My dad has not had a best friend for a long time, and now he's kind of coming into the whole "friend" game and he might be coming on a little too strong. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Playing hard to get goes a long way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, we're not dating! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I know, but you know... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're not dating. I don't think I'm scaring him off. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Every single time Jeff wants to hang out, you're available. You're an important guy. You've got stuff... you're busy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's an important guy, too. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know, but I'm just saying sometimes... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's got a billion hits on YouTube. &gt;&gt; BRODY: ...sometimes you gotta play hard to get. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Just a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Just a little bit. All right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You may be right. I've never really had a bromance. Maybe Brody's right. I haven't been in the "friend" game in a long time, so... maybe I am a little overbearing. I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You gotta just make yourself a little more unavailable. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Play a little hard to get. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's gonna make him want to hang out more. You're gonna like that. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Think about how much more you want to hang out with him now that he's on the road, doing all these dates. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Just do it. Trust me. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: There's romance in bromance. â™« &gt;&gt; ROB: I can't sit in here. My boobs, like, hang over the seat belt. He just fell. And he dropped his milkshake. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at those shorts. &gt;&gt; ROB: Which ones? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Those butt shorts. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is Skid Row from here? &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh, it's to the right. You've seen this, though, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dad used to take us here all the time. â™« My dad used to take my sisters and brother to Skid Row about four to six times a year, and we would go and either hand out food or blankets or whatever. And my dad really wanted us to be aware that we were very blessed. I just wonder, like, how do these people get in these situations? Hearing people's stories... they're so interesting. I always wonder, like, what are these people's stories? How did they get to where they are? Even if one of us in my family spiraled out of control, I just can't imagine all of us not helping. Don't you want to, like... just like go around, get out and ask questions? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't feel like it's appropriate for us to, like, kind of... honestly go and see these people. It just feels like you're crashing on their space. I just feel like it's very inappropriate. It's not... like... This is... this is home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you spoken to Kim? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I tried to call her. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dr. Crane called her today and said, "You have something called preeclampsia." Bad things could happen if this gets out of control. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What the hell are you doing here? &gt;&gt; JEFF: You don't call, you don't write... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You want to know what's going on? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brody told me that I was spending too much time with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so excited. I'm gonna help prepare and serve lunch at the Women's Center. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You will not walk out 307 00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,282 that door the same way you came in. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What the hell are you doing here? &gt;&gt; JEFF: So you're not dead. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm all by myself. &gt;&gt; JEFF: That's just sad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's the closest we could come. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Yeah. When I saw you, I thought... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're my first... my first male guy over. I was just scrambling up some eggs. What the hell are you up to? &gt;&gt; JEFF: So... you don't call, you don't write... you don't... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! What, are you feeling left out? &gt;&gt; JEFF: I thought you had a tumor or something. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no. No, I-I'm fine. This whole male bonding thing, I don't understand. Brody's telling me to play hard to get. This whole thing is so strange to me. All right, you want to know what's going on? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My sons, especially Brody, told me that I was spending too much time with you. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Tell Brody he's acting like a chick. This is stupid. If-if you're calling me too much, I'll tell you you're calling me too much. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; JEFF: If you're pissing me off, I'll go, "Bruce, stop texting me. You're pissing me off." Right. There's no dance here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; JEFF: We're not dating. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: In fact, not. &gt;&gt; JEFF: I love your children, I respect your children... All of them are great. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; JEFF: But you have to, at some point, go, "No, I'm gonna do something for myself." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's... probably you're right. Jeff is right. We just have a fun time together. I think we're doing everything right. I don't know what the boys and everybody are so, you know, worried about. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Oh, you can get in this one. There you go. That's the air intake, and his mouth opens up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's nice to have a friend outside of the family that has a lot of the common interests that I have. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Okay, ready? Fire it up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe I should just kind of do my own thing and not listen to everybody. It's all good. At this point, I gotta kind of just like go, "Screw my s..." &gt;&gt; JEFF: I respect what they're saying, but in this particular instance, they're-they're wrong. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're wrong? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Exactly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; JEFF: I'm a performer by trade. You ready? Holy! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now who's gonna clean it up? I'm here all by myself. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Surely you have a guy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE:No, I don't. 363 00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,084 You're my bitch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; FAYE: Hello, Khloe. I'm Faye. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Faye. &gt;&gt; FAYE: Welcome. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; FAYE: And thank you so much for coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks for having me. &gt;&gt; FAYE: Okay, so I'm gonna walk you over here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. I am going to the Downtown Women's Center. I'm really honored that they are allowing me to come here. I'm just excited to talk to a few of them. &gt;&gt; CAMILLE: So I just wanted to tell you a little bit about the center... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAMILLE: ...before you serve. These ladies can come get three meals a day, they can take a shower. Some ladies will stay with us for a little bit longer, and others will use us more as like a jumping-off point to finding fully independent housing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. Would you like fruit? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes, please. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Would you like some fruit? &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: I would love some of your fruit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Perfect. &gt;&gt; CAMILLE: Hi, ladies! &gt;&gt; WOMEN: Hi! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; CAMILLE: This is Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: Hi, Khloe. &gt;&gt; CAMILLE: She just wants to sit down and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, would you guys mind? &gt;&gt; CAMILLE: ...and hang out a bit. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: No, no. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 4: Sit down. &gt;&gt; CAMILLE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: How did you find out about us? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A friend of mine told me about this center... &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...and I was like, I would really love if I went down there. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: This place is... it's awesome. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 5: It is. It's a Godsend. We all have apartments in the Downtown Women's Center. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 4: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 5: I was homeless, I was in a shelter. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 5: And, uh, I lived there for like five or six months. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 6: And I'm new. I've just been here four days. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, no way. Four days! Wow! &gt;&gt; WOMAN 6: It's really nice here. I love it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: When I got here, I didn't call myself an addict. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: But I was in my addiction. And I got hit with some tremendous things. Uh... family things. And I spun out of control. 415 00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:41,460 And, uh, I had to, uh... get treatment. So, uh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do they offer, like, treatment here? &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: We have a referral for everything here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Inpatient, outpatient... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: ...therapy sessions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: And these women being there for me helping me to have hope that things could be different... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: ...that things could be better. I found out not everybody on Skid Row is down and out. There are those of us here who show that there is life after this. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 4: That's right. And hope. You will not walk out that door the same way you came in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 4: Trust me when I tell you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't help anybody who doesn't want help. But I feel like everybody here at the Woman's Center are people that genuinely want help and they want to progress in their life. And I'm just so honored that I'm able to at least spend one day with these people, that their stories are so touching. Guys, thank you for sharing. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 4: God bless you and your family. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 5: And make sure you come back and see us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would love to. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 4: You have to learn to 442 00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,866 dance with us on the 31st. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, I'm just heading to Kourt's. Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm trying to stay as calm as possible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need you guys to cancel your day. I just got off the phone with Paul, and I have something called toxemia. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is, what does that mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just have really high blood pressure, and he says my liver is shutting down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KIM: The only way to get rid of it is to deliver the baby. Basically, I have to deliver the baby today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What...? &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't get ahold of Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But is that safe? I mean... &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. I just want to be calm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, is this happening today, or do we not know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know, Kourtney... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...until I get her 465 00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,663 in the hospital and hooked up to a monitor! &gt;&gt; KIM: Basically, I have to deliver the baby today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What...? &gt;&gt; KIM: But I can't get ahold of Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But is that safe? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. I just want to be calm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, where are you now? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm at home now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: And Kanye lands at 5:00. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; KIM: So, he's on the plane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you spoken to Mom? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's just going to voicemail. Will you get ahold of Mom? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: She needs to meet us at the hospital. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you, too. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The baby is not supposed to be here for another five weeks, and we don't really have a plan. I don't know if the baby's gonna have to be in a incubator. So it's definitely scary. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, have you spoken to Kim about any of her messages? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm on the way to her house right now. The best plan is for you guys not to come to the hospital. I think that you coming right now would just draw too much attention to this whole situation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I'm going to Kourtney's house to be there and be on standby, basically. You go get Kim, take her to the doctor's, but the main thing is, is everyone is supposed to stay calm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't stay calm, Khloe. I'm not going to stay calm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know if you're the right person to send over there right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I'm totally the right person because I'm her mom, and I've given birth six times. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Only word to the wise is, remember, this is happening to her, and she's probably freaked out. So let's take it in stride. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I'll call you as soon as I get there and tell you what's going on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, love you. 504 00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,800 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why aren't you answering your phone or anything? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's charging over there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you spoken to Kim? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I got her e-mail, and then I tried to call her. And I don't know. Like, she didn't answer. What's going on? Did you talk to her? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Well, she got her blood test done yesterday. And Dr. Crane called her today and said, "You have to go to the hospital. You have something called preeclampsia." I am completely scared for Kim. And I'm trying to keep my cool because I can only imagine how Kim feels. No one in my family's ever had preeclampsia during a pregnancy. So it's pretty serious. And the unknown is scary. And so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So now what? Is this happening today? Are we just supposed to wait around? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. They just said wait. Well, Kim said to wait. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think we need to call Mom, but I don't want to annoy them if they're together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who cares to annoy Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, are you with Kim yet? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Almost there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, is this happening today, or do we not know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know, Kourtney, until I get her... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...in the hospital and hooked up to a monitor! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was just asking. Relax. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so why don't...? You need to calm down for Kim's sake. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I-I'm a little anxious right now. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell at you. I'm about to pick her up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. So why don't you just call us when you get to the the hospital then? &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like there's nothing that we can do except for wait. And everyone just needs to be patient until we hear when we can come over to the hospital. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Call us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think they would let it happen without us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if they don't have control over them? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: True. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is such a helpless- but-scary feeling just sitting here waiting. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing, but I don't feel right just sitting here waiting for this phone call on what to do. I feel like it's taking forever. Your Grandma's supposed to call us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's smiling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hold on. Emergency. Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, it's me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so, we're in the car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And everything is good. She's safe and sound. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom finally calls, thank God, and I feel better. I'm a little more relieved knowing that they're on their way to the hospital. So far, so good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So we'll leave here in 15 minutes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, bye, guys. See you then. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's so crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 15 minutes, P, 567 00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:14,920 and we're out the door. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Kimmy, what are we doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just got an I.V. and it really hurts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's see your I.V. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to talk about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And that is the worst part of this whole thing from what Mom and Kourt both said. And why are we here right now? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because I have irregular something... and toxemia. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It feels like yesterday that we were here when Mason and Penelope were born. And now the moment is finally here to meet my granddaughter. So excited about a new baby and a new start and a new chapter to our family. I look forward to watching all of my grandkids and my children grow up. And it's really truly one of the most magical times of my life. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so we are officially going through with this. I am so excited to meet you. Your dad is on a plane and literally lands now. He's gonna freak when he... realizes he's going to meet you really soon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In two days, 48 hours, is his first Father's Day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel more anxious then when I did when I was in labor, for some reason. It's the first time I'm gonna be an aunt and the first time I'm not the one in the situation. I am especially excited for my kids to have a cousin, and just excited to meet her little girl and see what she's like. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so excited! Oh! She's coming! 596 00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,459 &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't wait to meet you. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have the baby's name, and it's North West. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: But what if we named her just "North" and no last name? I kind of like it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sorry, Madonna. You just have a last name. Everyone, shut up! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You've invited Kim to live at your home, so these are some of your responsibilities now. 606 00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,017 &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are making me feel like â™« &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Brucey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So tired. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at the size of these grapes. I'm trying to think if they shrunk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, tell me all about it. How'd it go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was... I mean... it was crazy that it was happening. So, Kim has the epidural. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And Kim is so funny. I'm like, "Okay, Kim, like, you have to, like, push." She's like... And she just makes a face. And then she was like, "Is it out yet?" I go, "No!" I was like, "Kim, hold your legs and, like, scream it out or something." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Start screaming and push, right. Like you see in the movies, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's like, "I am." So, finally towards the end, like, she was getting it, and she had the baby. She's so cute, she's so little. Um... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What was she, like, four and a half? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Four pounds, yeah, four and a half pounds. They put her on her chest. She's like, "This is my baby. I'm just realizing I was pregnant." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's amazing how your entire life changes within those two little pushes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kanye, he was, like, holding her like this. Literally staring for, like, ten minutes. He was like, "This is just, like, crazy." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's always exciting to have another grandkid. I told my kids a long time ago, "My goal-- 30 grandchildren by the time I go." : Oh, God, I'm getting so old. So, was Mom driving everybody crazy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim couldn't reach Mom and then when I got in touch with Mom, Mom was like... ... a little, like, poodle. What she's doing today is frantically getting the place together because obviously no one was prepared for the baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can't wait to see the baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am going to go home and go to sleep, 'cause I am so tired. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here, want some grapes for the road? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're sure? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need to go to sleep. Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; DELIVERY MAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on in. Oh, they're so cute. &gt;&gt; DELIVERY MAN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Lovely. What a mess. As excited as I am for Kim and the baby to come home today, it's five weeks early, so all the things I was gonna do to prepare for baby, I have to do in 24 hours. What is this thing we have sitting in the middle of the baby's room because I've never seen anything like it. It looks like Kim is supposed to sit and poop on that thing. "SkyCaddie Watch." I don't know how one person can have so much crap. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. I found this in your drawer. I've got to clean out the garage and get all of Bruce's stuff out of there, so that we have room for all the strollers and playpens and all that stuff. I have to get a bed put into the baby's room. I have to get a changing table delivered. I have to get bottles and sterilizers. I'm freaking out. Do you want me to come over and help you organize all this stuff? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, how are you feeling? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? How's the baby? &gt;&gt; KIM: So good. She's getting a bath right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, when are you coming home? &gt;&gt; KIM: Probably tonight. They're just doing a little bit more blood work. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, um, well, I love you very much. We're getting the house all ready for you, so we're just about done. &gt;&gt; KIM: Amazing, love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited. Can't wait for you to get here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you, bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you, too. Bye, give her a kiss. Ah, that's like... aah! You know, my kids have weddings in nine days. And babies five weeks early. &gt;&gt; RHONDA: Before, before they're supposed to. 691 00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:13,779 &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're going to give me a heart attack. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do this. How's the changing table? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, it looks good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, there's a black bear in my baby's crib. That is cute. : Changing table! Hi, we magically had this appear. Are these socks? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop. They have to go right here. Those are the cutest things ever. I can't stop watching the clock, and they can't get here fast enough. I'm so excited for them to come home that I can't stand it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When are you coming home? &gt;&gt; KIM: Tomorrow. We have to wait an extra day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? Why, why, why? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because we have to do more, like, testing and stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is she okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, yeah, it's just, like, a little jaundice. She has to sleep in, like, a little incubator with a light tonight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can shine a light on her if she comes home. I have been running around like a chicken with its head cut off. And Kim says it's another day? This is torture! What time are you gonna come home? &gt;&gt; KIM: My boobs are so enormous. It's not even funny. You've never seen anything like it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your boobs? &gt;&gt; KIM: They're, like, the size of a huge cantaloupe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, they're ridic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, well, hurry up, I miss you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, too. I'm lonely and I need a baby! It's a girl! 725 00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,610 Okay mother, she was born! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you know that nobody called and ordered a bed for the baby nurse, and I had to do this myself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, are you okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know she's coming here tonight. Let me just ask you. If you walked home, and you were coming in with the baby, would you want to walk in and go, "Oh, look at this steamer right here"? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Look at this table in the middle of the room." And you're gonna put the changing table right under the air conditioning? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Then move it! We didn't even have a changing table until 8:00 last night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Help me, help me! &gt;&gt; KRIS: The bed... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just help me... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This room is despicable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, this crib appeared in the middle of the room. It was me who magically had a bed that you're sitting on arrive here yesterday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We don't use, we don't use baby wipes or products. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, really? You guys are crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think my mom is a little out of her mind. And just focusing on the wrong things. The baby's room is not ready yet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone, shut up! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This vibe is not good! This not a good vibe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up, shut up! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You've invited Kim to live at your home, so these are some of your responsibilities now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't do anything right. I have been working around the clock to do the best I can to get this room ready, and I've got the peanut gallery over here criticizing me over what I haven't done right. You know what? I think I've done a really good job so far, and you guys are making me feel like &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where do you do it? &gt;&gt; BORIS: In your arm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dr. Boris is coming over to give us all whooping cough shots. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Shot, shot, shot, shot! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, Kim and Kanye are pulling up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: With the baby? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, we're home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, Kylie! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you guys want to see where Kim and Kanye are gonna be sleeping? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is where they're gonna be sleeping. Isn't this nice? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, really beautiful. What is all this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is the placenta caps... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Gross. Ooh, why are they purple? That's cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, so they made her placenta... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, don't open it! That's hers. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's sick, she would eat her placenta. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, that's not... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, let's see... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if that has to remain closed? Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is her umbilical cord. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's really rude you opened it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And it's shaped like a heart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rude. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have to know because it could be dangerous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look how big this brassiere is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, I saw her boobs today. They're bigger than a frigging animal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, this... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, no. Those wouldn't, that wouldn't fit her right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who's at the door? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I saw she... I walked in, boobs out to here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, Boris is here to give us a shot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're getting whooping cough shots, everybody. Let's go. Come on, get on my bandwagon. Dr. Boris is coming over to give us all whooping cough shots. With a newborn, especially one five weeks early, it's really a good idea, for all the adults that are gonna be around the baby, to get these shots. You're eating Kanye's snacks? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's two. Hey, bud, how you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, let's go in the kitchen. &gt;&gt; BORIS: I mean, the risk is only for the baby... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The kitchen's that way-- where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The bathroom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's a hundred bathrooms down here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need to poop. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, guys, I'm gonna take a big old before the shot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, Scott, you go first. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Does this kind of thing have any kind of side effects other than... anything? &gt;&gt; BORIS: It hurts. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I heard that it kills. And then I heard that it kills for a week. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do I... do we really have to do it? Or does... will the baby be okay? &gt;&gt; BORIS: Whooping cough is really serious for little kids. Hospitalizations... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am not a shot type of girl. &gt;&gt; BORIS: Talk to your sister. I don't know that she'll let you around the kid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where do you do it? &gt;&gt; BORIS: In your arm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: On your arm. Dr. Boris, are we gonna be friends after this? Why are we doing this? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hold my hand. &gt;&gt; BORIS: You love your sister. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hold on! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Shot, shot, shot, shot... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that's not bad. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, come on! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I so thought I was gonna be like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, now I got nothing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does it hurt? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, was that it? Or another one? &gt;&gt; BORIS: That's it. That is it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, that was nothing. There you go. It's done. Does that hurt? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It doesn't? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, Kourtney, you were freaking us all out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're dead. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't even feel a thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, could I get a... I'm next. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, I never have to get a whooping cough shot again in my life. &gt;&gt; BORIS: I wish all my patients were this excited to get shots. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah. This is the new edition, thumbs to the side. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get the phone, Kylie. Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're all getting whooping cough shots for your baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have a question for you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: You know the baby's name is North West. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, but we were thinking what if we just named her just North, and no last name? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, why-why not even give her a first name? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, Kourtney. No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sorry, Madonna. She has to have a last name. As a human, you want an identity of your parents. You want to be a part of something. &gt;&gt; KIM: I kind of like it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whatever. It's not our kid. I really... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, I don't care. 864 00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:20,905 I barely even care what my name is at this point. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're on their way from the hospital, and I'm so excited. This is such a great day, and I have new granddaughter. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, Kim and Kanye are pulling up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? With the baby? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, we're home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall! 872 00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:45,830 Kylie! Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What a stupid armoire. Like, why does she have duplicates of everything? Three angels, three monkeys... &gt;&gt; KIM: Should I just put on a little cardigan? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, Kourtney 2.0, I can't deal. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what? I will not be compared to Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you are Kourtney. This is Kourtney all over again. The breast-pumping... Like, I'm gonna die. You would always be like, "I will never breast pump in front of people." &gt;&gt; KIM: In public. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're You have torpedo-sized... Honestly, I've never seen boobs that big in real life, ever. That was like a... &gt;&gt; KIM: Anna Nicole Smith? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To a "T," nail on the head. Literally, I... my jaw, I was like... Do you pump in front of Yeez? &gt;&gt; KIM: They... I had no choice in the hospital. I was literally, like, out of it, and they were, like, putting pumps on me. And I'm like, "Please don't stare at this." And so now I've just gotten used to it, and he'll come in the baby's room... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does it bother him? &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause I try and pump in there. No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your entire pregnancy you kept saying, "Coax. Don't do it. Coax. Don't do it. Coax," like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So what changed your tune? &gt;&gt; KIM: Labor was honestly the easiest thing ever. I did not feel one thing. Like, it was not hard, and then just staring at her, I'm like, "Oh, my God." Everything that they say happens-- that you fall so in love and it's this deep connection-- is true. Like, it's so crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim is the best mom, and she's obsessed with North. I just love how excited she is. All she does is send me pictures of the baby, like, dressed up in little things. So cute. I love seeing Kim in this phase. &gt;&gt; KIM: You just want to become so protective and just so different, and truly nothing matters. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you still want to shoot? &gt;&gt; KIM: Here's the difference between me and Kourtney. I'm like, I just want to come out to the world, like, naked and be like: I look so hot. I am back. You all called me a whale, Shamu, a cow... When I came back from the hospital, the first thing I did was go look at my vag in the mirror. It looks better-looking than before. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. So, like, how long are you gonna, like, be in this hiding zone? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not hiding. Like, I don't care. I just like to spend time with her, Kanye... Like, literally, we watch movies, we just chill. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: We get... I get so much work done just thinking of ideas of stuff that I want to do with, like, Dash, with everything that we do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But, like, are you struggling with, like, keeping some things more, like, private? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, from the start, Kanye's like, "You know, I'm not comfortable with selling her photos, like in a magazine reveal, to having her on the show." See, it's hard, 'cause like I love seeing Mason and Penelope, like, on the show. It's so cute, like, the little things that they say. But I do feel like... it's just a different dynamic with Kanye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To each their own. &gt;&gt; KIM: I signed on to do this, but it doesn't mean that, like, Kanye and my child have signed on to do it. So I'm fine with keeping them more private. I'm still an open book, and I still share my life, but... you can't expect everyone else to want to jump into, you know, a career that they just don't want to be in. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think my favorite thing of what you said... "North is my best friend." I thought that was like the cutest thing. You were like... &gt;&gt; KIM: She is. I hang out with her every single day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, like, you had such a difficult pregnancy, like, you know, we're all like, "We hope Kim can handle this." But it's really cute to hear you say that she's your best friend. &gt;&gt; KIM: She is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's really cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: BFF. I feel really good. My pregnancy has definitely been a journey. I have to tell you something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm pregnant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: With Yeez? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that everything happens for a reason, from my body changes... &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: This used to be 26! Why is my waist just getting so much bigger? Isn't that huge? And it wasn't even that huge earlier. ...to my hormonal changes, to pain I may have experienced... : It hurts so badly... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, I'm so sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...that I can hardly walk. I would tell people not to do it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Not to do what? &gt;&gt; KIM: Get pregnant. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Stop it. &gt;&gt; KIM: It hurts so bad. &gt;&gt; CRANE: The baby's fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, thank God. I'm getting worried. I've listened to you for weeks now say that you don't enjoy being pregnant, and it's breaking my heart. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm bringing it in, though. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need you to tell me... I need you to help me help you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everything has taught me a lesson. I'm having a girl. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna make the most amazing mother, and I can't wait until this baby is born. Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, sometimes you just have to take life for what it is and enjoy the ride. So I'm excited to take these next couple months off, take cooking lessons, just get into the mode of, like, cooking for me and my new family, and just being that kind of mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hitting the road, Jack. Bye, doll. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's seriously the cutest thing ever. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's the first day of my talk show. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good job, good. We just have a bunch of notes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A bunch? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know that my mom, like, wanted me to go on her show and I want to, but I feel like I'm just not ready. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Smile a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We are on the road! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Khloe, sit down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, everyone! We're going alien hunting! As much as I'm trying to enjoy going camping with my family, I also have to cater to Lamar's 998 00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,354 needs. Now he's M.I.A.
