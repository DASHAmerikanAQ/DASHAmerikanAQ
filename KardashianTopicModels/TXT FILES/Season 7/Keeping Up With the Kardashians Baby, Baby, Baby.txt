- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Previously on Keeping Up with the Kardashians... Mason! Mase. I am coming towards the end of my pregnancy and I'm so excited to be giving Mason a sibling. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So you've been trying to get pregnant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you gone to like a real fertility specialist? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The gynecologists haven't said I should. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: What's of interest is this little white line there which is relatively thin. You may not have ovulated. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just want to make sure my body is okay and that I'm fine, and this doesn't sound good. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Um, Khloe, I'm gonna chat with you a little bit. Your hormone levels are all normal, but as we kind of suspected from the ultrasound, you did not ovulate this month. And if you don't ovulate, then you can't conceive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have a baby. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Your gonadotropin levels are supposed to be in kind of a certain range. And they're not in that range. When this is high, it means that you don't make eggs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right now I'm freaking myself out 'cause... like who doesn't produce eggs? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: I'm gonna suggest that it may be helpful for you to take something to help you ovulate. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Welcome to Bagatelle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I learned a lot of information today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did, too. Just not all of it was positive. &gt;&gt; KIM: I totally disagree with you. I think you learned a lot of information. It's just gonna be a different way. The one thing I did learn from our therapy session, she said you can't like rewrite the story. You can just learn how to like deal with it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: So like it doesn't mean this is bad. This is just your path. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my momager. "Patented trademark offices hereby grants you the title 'momager.'" I'm a momager, people! Whoo-hoo! Have a little respect! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Would you sit down? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So I'm talking with Jen on the scheduling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's reading this thing. "It's about this thing-- Hayward Field, they want you to come. There's, you know, no money involved." &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's Hayward Field? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See? You don't even know. It's in Eugene, Oregon, honey. It's like the track capital of the world. So they're bringing all the Olympic champions back for the Olympic trials. So I want to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want to get at least Brandon and Brody to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall and Kylie have to go. It's the hundredth anniversary of the decathlon, so Hayward Field in Eugene is bringing all the Olympic champions back. This entire family wasn't around back in the days when I was competing and stuff, and so it's so important for me to bring Kendall and Kylie. I want them to share that experience with me and at least get an idea of what I did back then. I really, really want them to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, ask them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I hate this. Everybody's got such big schedules. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nobody said no yet, Bruce. Why don't you just have a little faith and go talk to your kids and find out who's doing what? Why don't you go play with 66 00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:29,642 your gold medal? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: At least I have one. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We just got home. So... Jojo and I went to the doctor's 'cause Kim wanted to go and freeze her eggs. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wanted to see what the process is of freezing my eggs. I mean, they showed us this chart of like at 22, your fertility is like here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like a hundred. &gt;&gt; KIM: 25 it goes down. You know, 26. At 32... it's like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It drops. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: If you freeze your eggs, what does that...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're the same, like whatever they are right now. In ten years, they'll be the same. So if you want to have kids... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Have to have a baby at 42. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you could have your 32-year-old eggs. So while she was doing that, Kim wanted me to go the doctor's because, um, statistically, if you have been trying for a year, unprotected and everything, and if you haven't gotten pregnant yet, you need to now do other steps. Like something's wrong. I got checked out, and I am not ovulating. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Why are you not ovulating? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We don't know. So I've been wasting two years of our time. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Wow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to now be put on medication to spark that chemical that makes my body release an egg. &gt;&gt; KIM: And we realized why Khloe hasn't gotten pregnant. That's like a really big deal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I just felt like something was not right, I think. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't want to react too much because I don't want to make her feel bad. It's something that happens, and I'm just gonna be there to support her. Help her get through it. You were proactive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would like if my husband would show a little bit of... 102 00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:13,679 &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I didn't know that. I love you. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney's here. Mason! Hi, Kourt. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you still pregnant? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Still am. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say, "Grandma, let's go outside." &gt;&gt; MASON: Grandma, let's go outside! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott, let's go have a little chat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Anything serious? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's actually good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Walk the plank! Argh, matey! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Somebody once said to me, "One is like one, two is like 20." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I could see that from your neck of the woods. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just wanted to say to you I'm really proud of you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really am. I was thinking about this the other day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's see after the second one gets here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I was thinking, "He is such a damn good dad." I can't wait to see how you are as the dad to a daughter. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is this a...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I just won't have time to say that when the baby comes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, thank you. You're very emotional. Are you pregnant? I appreciate the little credit from Kris. I'm pretty confident that I've been a great father for Mason. I want to be a great role model and a great person overall for my kids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-oh, oh, my God, the sprinklers went on. Mason! Oh, Mason! Oh! Come here, Mase! Come here. Get out of the sprinkler. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He usually likes the sprinklers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You got scared? &gt;&gt; MASON: I don't like the sprinklers. I want them off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He wants them off. You want to take your shirt off, Mase? &gt;&gt; KRIS: KoKo's gonna run. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Shirt off, Mase. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to run in the sprinklers? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want to run through the sprinklers with KoKo? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Mason! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The kid's cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See? You can't be afraid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Was that fun? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's getting really close to the end of my pregnancy, and I definitely am excited to give Mason a new little sister, but I also want to make sure and cherish the moments that I have with him while he is still an only child. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Go, go! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Run, run, run! &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's so funny. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's cute. Go, Mase, go! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good job, Mason! Yay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo! Good job, Mase. &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to do it again. I'm not scared. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not scared. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't believe you bought all this stuff for me to go to the Games. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at that. "Olympic Trials '72--" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. I was just looking at that. I can't believe they made a shirt. Look at this. This is what we were just talking about, "Olympic Trials, Hayward Field, Eugene, Oregon 1972." That was the first time I went to the Games, the trials. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, I know. That's why we bought you the t-shirt. Hey, did Kendall and Kylie ever give you an answer if they're going? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what? I don't... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes or no? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, they said no, okay? They said no. They're like adamant they don't want to go. I was like, "Are you kidding me? It's gonna be a great time." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Teenagers don't get going to the Olympic trials and hanging out at a track. They want to be at the beach with the boys right now. They're teenage girls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Been through this before, and I learned, you know what? You can't force 'em to do something if they don't want to do it. But, you know, I think they're really gonna miss out on something. It hurts. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't tell your mother you're going to a fertility clinic? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kourtney might have her baby tonight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am starting to officially have contractions, and I feel like tonight's the night. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just scared. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bro, man! Right on time. Right on time. Let's do it. That's huge. I can't get this from the other side, you know? It's time to go back to Eugene, Oregon. Boy, it's been a long time. Very excited, uh... Brandon and Brody are going, so that really makes a huge difference to me. Here's the deal. I'm going on this trip. I hope I don't bore you with massive amounts of nostalgia. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No, you won't. Of course not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I love nostalgia. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Next stop, Eugene. Sure. How you doing? &gt;&gt; REPORTER: How does it feel to be back at the track-and-field trials? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm coming back to track-and-field God's country right now. Oh, my God, there's two in the house. &gt;&gt; MAN: Do your kids ever see old videos of this stuff? Too much of it? Way too much of it? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's pretty cool, and I've seen almost all of it. It's inspiring. I get a little teary-eyed, watching his round the first or the last corner of the 1,500. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's the way you finish it off. &gt;&gt; MAN: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come in big. Good to see you, sir. &gt;&gt; DAN: You, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm doing fine. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I really don't get to do all these things with my dad very often, so this experience is really cool. I'm really excited to be here in Oregon. It's a really cool environment, and everybody's been just ecstatic about Dad being here. &gt;&gt; DAN: I think you're one of the top 20 Olympic historical... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, right, yeah. All we got left is memory. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you going in? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're gonna go up. So we are at the charity, Dress for Success, that helps empower women to look their best and have a great wardrobe in order to go on job interviews and get a job. We beefed up the security to make sure I wouldn't get flour-bombed at this Dress for Success event. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: Hearing each and every one of their stories really touched my heart and just really seeing hands-on what this organization does for women. And no matter what you go through and no matter what your situation is, there's always something you can do to help another sister. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. Thanks, everybody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Noelle just told me that you guys went to the fertility clinic. I had no idea that that's where you guys went yesterday. You don't tell your mother you're going to a fertility clinic? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? I mean, I just have been on the pill for so long. I just wanted to see, does that like affect anything? Does that hurt it? Like, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did he say? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like my hormones were really low, my egg count, like everything's low, but that's how it's supposed to be because I'm on birth control. So he said either I can go in to freezing my egg now or... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna freeze your eggs? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I haven't decided. The process of freezing eggs is definitely a lot more difficult than I thought. It starts off with all this blood work. You have to inject yourself with hormones for a week straight. I don't know if I should, if I shouldn't. I think I'm just a little bit still confused. Maybe you should ask Khloe what he said about Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is it bad? &gt;&gt; KIM: He thinks that everything looks healthy around it except for just she's not ovulating. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's so crazy that she's not ovulating, and she's been trying to get pregnant? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I think she'll be fine. I think she just needed to go here, needed to see that she wasn't ovulating. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could you imagine if she waited another year? I'm speechless. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. She starts this medication like day three into her period, and she starts her period like tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop. Well, it's definitely meant to be. I mean, all of this is in God's hands anyway, and it's all meant to be. She's gonna make the most amazing mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Poor girl. It has been such a crazy year for my family. Kourtney could have her baby at any minute, Kim might be freezing her eggs, and Khloe is having a hard time with fertility. And even though Khloe puts on a brave face, at the end of the day, it's still painful. I think you should get off of birth control, and I think you should just let your body rest and find its own rhythm. Your body has a natural rhythm, and you won't know what that is until you're off it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll talk to my boyfriend about that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just saying, he knows all about rhythm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that not absurd? Pomeranian husky miniature? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so cute, but guess what? We're not getting a puppy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, just keep popping kids out, but all right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you gonna pack your hospital bag or do you wants us to do it for you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you gonna pack? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Probably a tuxedo. This baby's coming, and it really puts into perspective that I'm going to be a father of two. It's pretty nuts. But yeah, I'm gonna bring some toiletries. I'm gonna probably bring an oil-free moisturizer. 282 00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:00,839 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's pop this sucker out and get rolling. &gt;&gt; BRODY: So how does it feel to be back? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good stuff. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Is it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, hey, you decided to join us? So nice of you. Come on. Take a seat, buddy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Did you fall asleep on the plane? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I did. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got a good picture of you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, yeah? Me sleeping? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, good. Nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I could have poured something down it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I am so upset right now. How dare you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can tell. Did you send Kendall and Kylie the picture of us standing in front of the American flag? &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, I need to though. I'm sure they'll see it on Instagram. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Start calling them out on Instagram. Sure wish Kendall and Kylie were here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I should. Like Dad's really upset you guys are not here right now. So what did they have to do? Tell me, they're having a party? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They had nothing to do. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I thought Kylie would have wanted to come. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I can tell that my dad's upset that Kendall and Kylie didn't come. He kind of brushes it off and makes it seem like no big deal, but I know that it bothers him. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, oh, well. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: One day. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Just the Jenner boys here, huh? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So what is it? You're a Gemini or a Cancer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't want your daughter to be like your fiancé? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your boobs are huge. You are a sexy pregnant person. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: So I told Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You told Mom what? &gt;&gt; KIM: About the fertility clinic, and Mom had no idea what we were talking about. Trying to tell her-- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So what is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Basically, everything looks good, like her insides. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I don't ovulate. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It must be really hard for Khloe to find out that she's not ovulating, but I am happy that she knows this information and could get on the right path to making it happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you think you should have just asked me or anything first, if you think that's your place to say? place. Like everyone has to respect me. What I'm going through, it's not something that I like have fun talking about over and over and over again, and I don't think that my family realizes how hard it is for me to talk about it, too. He just said out of all the sisters, I have to be the one to like not have babies. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna have babies. 332 00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,925 It's not even a question. &gt;&gt; ROB: You figured out the problem. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: From 1976 Games, gold medalist Bruce Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It was a really special moment, and I will absolutely never forget that. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Kourt, tell us where we're at? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're at the hospital; I'm gonna put on this gorgeous gown. I finally feel like this is happening. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wouldn't it be embarrassing if I'm not even in here? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I bet you're all over the place. &gt;&gt; BRODY: They got you. You know he did his research. He knows he's in here. I don't know, let's find out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Today, I get to take Brandon and Brody to the University of Oregon, where they have this museum. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ooh. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, you made it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, okay. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: And you gotta stand next to it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I gotta stand next to it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I wanna see that pose. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what I think I should do? Is if I could get this little fathead thing off the wall and put it in Kendall and Kylie's room. What do you think? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Then and now. &gt;&gt; BRODY: This is awesome. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Really cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow, look at that guy. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, look at that guy. That guy is a stud. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I left that pole in the stadium when I was done. Today, I would love to have that pole. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Sometimes you go through the busy day in/day out stuff, and you kind of get lost in just living. You know, being to this museum, and seeing the history of the decathlon, I really think my kids can understand better today about why I worked so hard and what I was able to accomplish in my life. No pictures of Kris. &gt;&gt; That's funny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. It's kind of nice. 369 00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:19,631 No Kim pictures, no nothing. Just the old man. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Am I allowed to park here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, it didn't say Dash, but... &gt;&gt; ROB: It said "Reserved." So it's not open yet, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, we're just moving in today. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? What outfits do you choose? It's like you are the new Bruce Jenner. &gt;&gt; ROB: How is this Bruce Jenner? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just like green socks, gray pants with "C"s on them. I'm just... &gt;&gt; ROB: What, are you PMSing? This is like a really dope store. It's crazy, you have like Miami, New York... like Calabasas... you should be really proud. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My sisters and I have finally moved Dash to Melrose, in L.A., and it's such an accomplishment for us. It's been something that we've wanted to do for so long, and we're finally able to do it. When you see this location compared to the old one, you're like, "Wow." Dash New York is perfect, now we have Dash L.A., and now we have got to step up Dash Miami. Hey. We gotta move that Miami store. After being here, it's like... we need it to be much cooler. We're moving the store. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Wait, do the dressing rooms look good and all that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everything looks phenomenal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: But you like it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Died. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am so glad that Brandon and Brody came to this thing. You know, for me, it's always been a challenge to try to build a relationship with them. To be able to spend really good quality time with them means the world to me. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: From 1976 Games, gold medalist Bruce Jenner! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Bruce! Bruce! &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Two world records set here at historic Hayward Field. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: My dad's accomplishments were so incredible, and they touched so many people. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Being able to see him around all these people that are so excited, and that witnessed what he had accomplished-- it was a really special moment, and I will absolutely never forget that. &gt;&gt; 412 00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:28,827 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: It looks so amazing. Oh, my God, look at this. Look at the flowers. Kourtney's face is actually so funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The flamingos are so cute. I love it. Today is my baby shower. I'm excited to see friends and family, and celebrate this special day. Look it! &gt;&gt; VENDOR: Wow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh... whoa! &gt;&gt; FRIEND: Wow! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, now, look. You take a little piece off, and then you eat it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want you to meet my boyfriend. I brought him. He was in town for the day. Babe, this is my friend Sara. &gt;&gt; SARA: Hi. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Is this Moses? &gt;&gt; SARA: Yeah, this is Moses. &gt;&gt; KANYE: What's up, Moses? What's up? How you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: He really is like so cute. Do you want to hold him? It feels really good for Kanye to be here with my family. &gt;&gt; SARA: Moses, smile. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, there. Okay, I got a good one. I'm glad that he can meet like my dad's whole side of the family and some of my not-so- immediate family that he's never met before. And also just to see like how close of a family we are. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS/KOURTNEY: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, tone it down a notch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm happy that you guys are finally doing your thing. I think you both complement each other, and I think you both deserve to have what you guys want. It's about what you guys emotionally are capable of giving. You understand each other's worlds, and that's what you both deserve. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Yeah, I think I'm pretty content. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like in what way? &gt;&gt; KANYE: Like just in every way. Lettingnot get in your way and having to learn to go through stuff and learn how to sacrifice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know Khloe likes Kanye. You know, Khloe is definitely not one to hold her tongue. I mean, she was very vocal about how she felt about my last relationship. She always is. So her approval is important to me. &gt;&gt; KANYE: You know, it's scary, but it's about me being responsible with my heart and everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She was like, "Do you think I'm crazy like for after all this time, now Kanye and I are talking?" I was like, "No, I think this is one of your most healthiest relationships you've ever been in because you guys actually are friends and have been throughtogether and understand each other. And you guys have the same interests." &gt;&gt; KIM: I really feel like I'm in a great relationship, but I'm not gonna rush it. Shall we? Let's go. But then also when it comes to having kids, what if when the time is right, I just don't produce eggs? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You might as well get the epidural if you're gonna get it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm getting it. Holyballs. a duck. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Dr. Surrey wants you to have two hormones checked. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. What I'm trying to figure out with my body is very frustrating and it doesn't make you feel good. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know if a lot of the words fit. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Laugh. Just... I just made you laugh. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Today Kendall and I are hanging out with my brother Brandon, and we are going to help him with his music video. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're not even... &gt;&gt; SINGER: ♫ Oh, my God ♫ ♫ Hey, hey, hey... ♫ &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Good work. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thanks, brah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You guys are awesome. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're awesome. Pretty hard to believe you're my father's son. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Why do you say that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm kidding. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: He's cooler than all of us, honestly. I think it's important that you guys remember or at least acknowledge all the stuff that he did because he accomplished so much in his life. And it's really something that all of us as his kids should be really proud of. I understand what it's like to be a teenager, but life is short, and you only have your parents around for a certain amount of time. I think it's important for them to have a little bit of a broader outlook on who Dad is and what he's accomplished. He was really bummed that you guys weren't there for the trials. You know, while we were up there, I heard him talking about you guys and all of his kids, and he said, "My two little gold medals, Kendall and Kylie." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Aw. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: And that means more to him-- well, it's true. You guys mean a lot more to him than his actual gold medals. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I think it just meant a lot to him if you guys would have been there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I do think we feel a little bad for not going, but... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Don't feel bad about it; you can't change what's happened, but just, you know, use it as a reason to do something next time. It's all good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But like you really can't do that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It doesn't even go this way, I don't think. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Good job. Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that right? I feel like it's... Hold on. This could go in. With the new baby, we have to do some of these family things such as building a stroller. It is a lot of time when you get to really bond with your partner or wife or whatever it is. Pow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He likes to sit up, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let the kid live good. Let's compromise. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're getting the hang of this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT:yeah, I am. I was built for this &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You know, Dr. Surrey wants you to have two hormones checked... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: That are cycle-based specific. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Today I have to get ultrasounds to see if any new activity is happening with my ovaries and make sure that I produce eggs. You know, what I'm trying to figure out with my body is very frustrating and it doesn't make you feel good. &gt;&gt; SURREY: Um, we're gonna talk tomorrow to finalize our plan based upon your hormone levels today, but what it's gonna be is that you're gonna take some pills. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: And then the injection would actually probably start on Tuesday. And there is a little catheter that goes through your cervix. It's totally precautionary. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you feel that? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You might have a little bit of cramping. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The word "catheter" does not sound fun. Where does it go? Inside of me? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Through the cervical opening. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Into the uterus. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where are you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: In your room. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: In my room? I think these are our jerseys. Whoa! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait. He actually signed these? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's so cool. Kylie and I feel really bad that we couldn't make it to the trials, and we're trying to figure out what we can do to make it up to him. It's really expensive. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's for one person? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. Why don't we just have Mom book 'em and do everything? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, but I think we should pay for it with our own money. I feel like it means a little bit more. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It would be such a fun experience to watch the Olympic Games with him. Do you have the itinerary? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, yeah, it's in my room. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's so small on me. Bring the itinerary here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want something to eat? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is your very own opening ceremony. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That was actually very cute. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thanks, Dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, where did you guys get those shirts? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Online. You signed them and you probably thought, "I'm just signing these shirts." A couple years later they end up with your daughters. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And we're really sorry that we didn't go to Oregon, but this is not the only surprise. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it's not? What else do we have? Now that you're feeling so guilty... &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: London 2012. You're going with us? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No way. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Meeting me in London? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you excited? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How cute is that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nice to see how excited and happy my dad is that we're going to London with him. I think it's a way to show my dad that we do care and that we are impressed with everything he's done and that he does mean a lot to us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so cute! You're going to the Olympics! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are we leaving Mom at home? 584 00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:47,552 &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Okay, good. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, I got a boo-boo here today. &gt;&gt; MASON: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to kiss it? Thank you! All better. There's Mommy. &gt;&gt; KIM: KoKo, how was your doctor's appointment? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I had to do another ultrasound like when you're on your period. &gt;&gt; KIM: You had to do one while you're on your period? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, because on your period is when they can start to see your eggs and your ovaries. That's how they wanted to know like, was this just a one-month thing that I didn't produce eggs or has it been going? and I'm not... He said that there's no eggs. So he said it's, that it's been going on. It's not just a one-month thing. On Monday, they want me to go to that radiation guy and do my... You have to have a catheter put in you. And he's gonna teach me how to do my injectables. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have to do it yourself? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You'll be fine. It'll all be worth it in the end. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really appreciate Kim trying to be so positive, but what is this medicine gonna do to my body? If I'm already moody and crazy, it's gonna make me moodier and crazier. I don't know. It's just a lot of stress and I think it's a lot more pressure. Nothing ishappening. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So this is your first shot? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but you're supposed to do it in your stomach, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look how big that needle is. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But you can't do it up close slow. You have to go boom! 617 00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:27,618 &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Just ten centimeters. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Holyballs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This baby's coming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, where are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Upstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: So I wanted to tell you that I was gonna start the process of freezing my eggs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. So I picked up all the medication and the needles and everything that I would possibly need for the injections. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So this is your first shot? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. But you're supposed to do it in your stomach, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look how big that needle is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Being on birth control, your hormone levels are completely low, so you have to inject yourself with hormones and help your eggs to multiply before they extract them. Oh, my God, I'm so scared to do this. I don't think I want to do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll do it for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I don't want you to do it for me. I have to do this by myself once a day for seven days, so let me get used to doing it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't do it up close slow. You have to go boom! One, two, three, boom. &gt;&gt; KIM: You do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just don't do it slow. Just do it! &gt;&gt; KIM: &gt;&gt; KRIS: &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't do this! &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, this is for your future daughter right there in that fat you're holding. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: I was too scared! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You like went in like a millimeter, and then you took it out! &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I need you to do it. Are you sure you can do it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I'm sure I can do it. Okay, are you ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, just make... I need more like of your skin. Okay, one, two, three. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ah! You my finger! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? I did? I got your finger? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow! It's just such a We have no idea what we're doing. I feel like how can you do this without any glasses on? Are you sure? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I'm positive. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you see? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have my glasses on. Okay, one, two, three. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, that didn't even hurt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! &gt;&gt; KIM: Cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: That didn't even hurt. I'm glad that I'm freezing my eggs. I think now I can just be proactive. I want to make sure when the time is right, I want to be prepared. I should be safe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "How to Give Yourself a Shot 101." &gt;&gt; KIM: Or how to not give yourself a shot. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do I look like a heroin addict with all my blood drawn? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Nah, you don't look like no heroin addict. How'd your doctor visit go today? All the stuff that they give you is working? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not that simple. I wish it was. It's so, so technical. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It'll happen when it's supposed to happen. Ovulating or no ovulating. At the end of the day, it's still a miracle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, don't tell me that because I need help. I need help with it. I mean, I'm really appreciative Lamar is trying to be so positive, just thinking it's so easy. He just doesn't know that I can't do anything. Now you're just gonna make me... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why theam I doing all this to myself? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ready to meet your little girl soon? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's about to happen. We're getting close. I can't wait to meet her. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: One more good contraction. 688 00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:58,362 Deep breath and push again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now you're just gonna make me feel very... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why theam I doing all this to myself? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No, no, no, that's not... that's not what I said. You took the wrong way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I'm sensitive Suzy over here. Hormone city. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You know, maybe it was meant for us to, you know, spend more time, get our, get ourin order. It's good for you to know what's going on in your body, period. Okay, now you know, now you know what you need to do. At the end of the day, it's me and you. Getting through whatever we got to get through, however we got to get through it. We get through anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am going through a million different emotions in my head, but I feel like through every trial and tribulation, it does just make us stronger. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It was just meant for me to have just one baby for a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's your one baby? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You, sugar dumplings. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kourtney? Kourtney might have her baby tonight. &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm gonna play with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Want to go in the playroom? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yes, come into the playroom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am starting to officially have contractions, and I feel like tonight's the night that my baby's gonna come. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You guys should probably leave soon, right? Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I'm just scared. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why are you scared? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause it's scary. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I don't want to leave Mason. I'm feeling very emotional and nervous, and even though I've done this before, you know, I still just feel very anxious about what the next few hours will bring. This is the last time with Mase like as an only child. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Have you seen what only children turn out to be like? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: True. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It'll be so fun for both of them. I know. You guys should probably head... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mason, come here. Mom wants to say bye to you. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Go say bye. &gt;&gt; MASON: Bye, Mommy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Give me a hug. &gt;&gt; MASON: I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mase, you know we're gonna go pick up your sister. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Then we're gonna bring her home to you. &gt;&gt; MASON: Airplane! Airplane! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to come see us tomorrow in the hospital? &gt;&gt; MASON: Airplane! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You just want to go on the airplane, don't you? &gt;&gt; MASON: Airplane. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you. 738 00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:28,279 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, guys, we're gonna go have kids. See you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm making a quick meal to get that belly going. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We decided to stop by Kim's house because she lives closer to the hospital, and while I'm waiting for my contractions to get closer together, we just want to know that we're as close to the hospital as possible. See, it starts light, and then it gets like... &gt;&gt; KIM: So we're hanging out at the house, and she starts getting contractions. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My back is having pains. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what that means. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have no idea. We have her bag already packed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's hit the road 'cause now I'm getting antsy. &gt;&gt; KIM: And we head to the hospital. Gonna bring my laptop just in case you want to... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, let's just get it and go. She's not very speedy, is she? I feel bigger than ever at this point. 757 00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:25,002 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I guess you're gonna feel a lot skinnier in a couple hours. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Kourt, tell us where we're at? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: At the hospital, and I'm gonna put on this gorgeous gown. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KIM: Look who's here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now that my family members are starting to trickle in one by one... &gt;&gt; ROB: We are here 7-8-12. About to have a baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Round two. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I finally feel like this is happening. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So you made progress. You won't have to get the epidural if you're doing good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I'm getting it. Thishurts. Holyballs. a duck. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't it crazy? It's like almost 3:00 a.m. And she's so calm. &gt;&gt; NURSE: She's ten centimeters. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ready to meet your little girl soon? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney is definitely much more nervous this time around, I think, because she knows what's gonna happen. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Take a really deep breath. And we're gonna grab these legs, and you curl your chin onto your chest and try to push it right down. That's good. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Push again. Push it harder. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This baby's coming. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay, that was great. You know what, one more good contraction. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's about to happen. We're getting close. It is so calm, so peaceful, and 784 00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:56,894 I can't wait to meet her. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Deep breath, and push again. Here comes the head. There she is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my goodness. Oh. Oh. &gt;&gt; That's our baby. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Oh, there she got it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And we've got a girl. A little one. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: What are you guys calling her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Penelope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have a baby! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, she's so cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's such a magical feeling to stare at my little baby girl. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, how are you feeling? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just really happy. She's beautiful. It's a good day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My baby girl's Penelope Scotland Disick, and she is absolutely perfect. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Did it feel weird to pull her out, Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, feels good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney just loves pulling out her own children. She decides to pull out Nelly as well. Go for it, sister. Do your thing. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason's gonna love her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mason's about to be here to meet his little sister. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That was a weird noise. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Guess who's here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Want to go see your little sister? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You want to meet your little sister? &gt;&gt; MASON: Hi, Kenny. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, Mase. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go say hi. This is your sister. Look at that little baby. &gt;&gt; MASON: I wanna lay with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want to lay with me? Mase, your sister got you a present. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mason... &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow, this is from your baby sister. She got you a present. &gt;&gt; MASON: This is so big! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I decided to get Mason some presents from Penelope to him, just so that he 821 00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:10,027 feels extra special when he comes to meet her for the first time. &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to touch hands. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Missed you last night. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mommy. Why's the baby in that crib, Mommy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause she's sleeping. &gt;&gt; MASON: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause she's tired. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Looking at Penelope and watching my daughter give birth just reminds me it doesn't get any better than this. &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to tell you a secret. Baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was so blessed to have six beautiful babies. It's the biggest joy in my life. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at her feet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Touch those little feet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I really want at the end of the day is for all of my daughters to experience that. That amazing blessing in life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Her name is Penelope. 839 00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,683 &gt;&gt; MASON: No, her name is sister. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I say we do things Miami style. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't even look at her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is a decision you're making? &gt;&gt; KIM: I really don't want... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She just doesn't get it and never will. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo-whoo! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, Miami! The Kardashian sisters are back!
