- This season on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're having a girl. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I never honk at people, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whatever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kanye and Kim, they're kind of like two peas in a pod. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; ROB: I honestly can't take you seriously. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the hell? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you afraid? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To the Dominican. Cheers. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You are our sacrifice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Help me. You're grounded. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You ready? &gt;&gt; ROB: You're freaking me out right now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I literally just want to go home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Go home. No one's stopping you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right...! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is why I don't come on vacations with you guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your life is totally consumed by this. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I know that I can make any team a championship caliber team. I got to just get back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People don't get how muchI'm put under. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I left my husband for this guy. 25 00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:58,558 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't understand. Like, I could never do that to my children. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe! Mason. You know where I live? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where do I live? &gt;&gt; MASON: ...Texas. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I live in Texas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so excited that Khloe's in town 'cause we never get to see her anymore. There's been so much going on with us. I'm expecting my second baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How's your pregnancy going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This time, I feel a lot wider. Like, this time, literally, all day I'm literally going like this all day. And then my underwear are normally way down here, so I have to all day also pull them out. My whole body is, like, widening so the underwear go lower and lower. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That means it's gonna be easier for you to have labor when you're wider, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well then, widen these babies up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go eat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna go get Bruce. Let's go get Grandpa. &gt;&gt; MASON: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Grandpa. Ever since I've moved to Dallas, I've missed my family. Bruce? Grandpa's not here. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Huh. Even if it's just two days, I try to spend as much family time as I possibly can. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you craving anything? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not really. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's been so sexual this time around. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Has she? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pretty sure the last time we had sex was when she got pregnant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who wants to make love all night long? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just so excited that the whole family is here. After going through a divorce this past year, it just really taught me that family is the most important thing and can really pull you through any situation in life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm out of here, guys. Oh, I thought you were gonna kiss me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, Mom, you're too close to my mouth. Mom! Mom! &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow, ow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please don't leave. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There is not one part of me that wants to be a part of that right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, get the off of us! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, there's profanities. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, whatever. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What a turn-off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. See ya. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank you very much. Love you, bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, love you, too. Oh, my God, Bruce, honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How long have you been up here? Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? I was watching the golf on TV. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We just finished dinner, and Khloe just left. We thought you weren't even here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was right here. Obviously, you didn't look everywhere. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're a grown man and you don't know to come down for dinner? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, that's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, no, it's not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everybody's left? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Gone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm going to bed downstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, I'm sorry. I mean... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know where I'm wanted: with the dogs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Really? Bruce sleeps through dinner, and it's going to suddenly be my fault because I'm his keeper. He's usually pretty responsible, but he's also a hermit, so I just figured he didn't want to come to dinner. Ever since my book came out, people have been coming out of the woodwork with false accusations, like Robert Kardashian's ex-wives accusing me of not being faithful when Khloe was conceived. Not true. I know all the rumors are 96 00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:44,017 absolutely ridiculous, but Khloe tells me all the time that she's really against doing a DNA test. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I don't care either way because my dad is my dad and my stepdad's my stepdad. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Even though Khloe puts on a brave face, I know that deep down inside, it really does hurt her. And it kills me that any of my children are hurting because of my past mistakes. And that's why it's so important to me that she does do this DNA test, so that once and for all, she can feel and be at peace. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, so I'm just a little annoyed right now because I'm getting all these Google alerts about this whole... the paternity of Khloe Kardashian stuff. This story, it-it's just not going away. I mean, it's gonna take something that proves it false once and for all in my opinion. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I feel like it's long gone, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, it's not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, everyone will forget about it sooner than later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, why wouldn't we just do a DNA test? Once and for all, we have an answer. Like, this is the truth. Done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I don't need an answer, so get over yourself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It concerns you. What? When Khloe doesn't want to deal with something, she has a really slick way of sweeping it under 122 00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:11,337 the rug, but I know this is something she really needs just so that she feels complete. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, um, I heard that you were, um, a specialist for DNA processing. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; TADDIE: Yeah, with respect to paternity and family relationships. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My question to you is if I wanted to prove the paternity of one of my children, how am I able to do that? &gt;&gt; TADDIE: As you know, everyone gets half of their genes or half of their DNA from their mom and half from their dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: So when we test you with your children, we will be able to determine by comparing your genes to theirs, what genes they got from their father. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The doctor tells me if one of the parents is deceased, the next best thing from having the parent there is to have three siblings. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: The sample we collect, we swab the inside of your cheeks for about ten seconds each. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, well, thank you, Dr. Taddie, and, um, I'll be calling you in a couple of days, okay? &gt;&gt; TADDIE: Sounds good, Kris. Good luck to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, thank you. Buh-bye. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: You're welcome. Bye. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls, what are you doing? Girls! I'm watching. I'm watching the news. Why don't you girls watch the news with me? Lately, it's typical for me to be forgotten in this family. Everybody's running around doing their thing. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't hurt her. What does a guy got to do to get a little respect around here? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thanks, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll find another room. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Stop. &gt;&gt; JAY LUCHS: Okay, so we're gonna go this way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Our Dash lease is up in a month, so my assistant, Sheiva, and I are going to meet with our realtor. We've been trying to schedule a time for me, Kim, and Khloe to look at locations, but there's never been a time when we're all in town. I'm just over it. I want to get this done. &gt;&gt; JAY: This space is 2,000 feet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's a good size. &gt;&gt; JAY: It's a really good size for you. &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: This is cool. Has Kim seen this space? Or Khloe or...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. I told Kim to come and she had a dentist appointment. I just need this done, and I can't, like, wait around for them. This space has a lot of potential, but I definitely want to see all my options so I know that we're picking the perfect spot, but I'm relieved that we're making some progress and at least starting to see what's out there. This is my favorite one. &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Family meeting time. Come here, kids. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ow! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, is that my scarf? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. What I want to talk to you about is I've had a lot of sleepless nights over the fact that Khloe's been tortured because she doesn't really know, in her mind, who her real dad is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And there's no way that her ego is gonna allow her to do, like, a proper DNA test. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think my mom's going a little crazy with these paternity tests with Khloe. I don't think my mom should care about what people say about her book if she knows the truth. Khloe's really my sister and my mom's daughter, so it's a little weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What I need from you guys is just your permission for this doctor to come into the house and swab your mouths, and then he's gonna... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But if Khloe's not involved in this, I don't understand why we're doing it behind her back. &gt;&gt; KIM: Because she's already said, "No, I don't want to know. I don't want to know. I'm fine. Dad will always be my dad, no matter what. I don't even want to know." &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's no way to go through life. You want to know that your father's your father. &gt;&gt; KIM: But somewhere deep in her heart she does question it. I mean, she called me hysterically crying, going, "Please just tell me. I know you know." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, I just don't want it to be a big secret and shady. Like, there's no reason she needs to not know about this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourt, I just need your blessing and I need you to say yes for the test. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, whether she admits it or not, might feel so much better after knowing the truth. But then, part of me also feels like I would want Khloe's blessing before I went and did something like this behind her back. So I really just don't know what to do. Oh, my God, a space for Dash is available. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's something that we're all supposed to, like, do together. Kourtney thinks she's the president of Dash. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't eat chips up here on the brand-new couch. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My wife is driving me crazy. I don't even feel like I'm wanted here anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We've all agreed to do a DNA test and put it to rest. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to. Leave me alone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourt, I just need your blessing, and I need you to say yes for the test. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I'll do the DNA swab now, but you're gonna have to tell Khloe. We're gonna have to get a DNA sample from her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll tell her. Come on. Thank God Kourtney's on board. Kourtney can be the most difficult, so now that she's into it, this is such a big sense of relief for me. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on in. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: I'm Dr. Taddie. I'm here to see Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm Bruce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; TADDIE: Hey, Kris. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have no idea what Kris is up to. But, as usual, I'm always the last to know. Why is this doctor here? Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because we want to do a test that proves that Robert Kardashian is Khloe's real dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. Kris, Kris, Kris, Kris... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I got to help. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're just bending to the tabloids, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm making Khloe feel better about herself. That's what I'm doing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's fine about herself. I really think Kris has gone too far, again. The reason this subject is even talked about is because it was in her book. I mean, she's got to let this 243 00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:25,278 thing go. I don't think she needs to prove anything to Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. Thank you. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: Take care, folks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Two down, two to go. Rob's next. And then I've got to figure out what I'm gonna do about Khloe. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim, yo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, this is nice. &gt;&gt; ROB: So I'm planning to go out to Europe to meet with manufacturers regarding my sock line, and kind of just, like, explore the whole fashion world. But before I go to Europe, my mom, Kim and I are going house hunting. Personally, I want to own something, and I feel like it's a good time to buy a home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. Wow. This is pretty snazzy. I like the location. Can I talk to you just really quick right over here? &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know all the crazy rumors about who Khloe's dad is-- I want to do a DNA test. &gt;&gt; ROB: I can't believe we have to actually do this, like, prove to her... &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you're not making it any better by... &gt;&gt; ROB: It's so obvious she's our sister. Like, come on, what are you saying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is the last time I'm gonna see you for, like, a month. &gt;&gt; ROB: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a doctor outside. I just want this over with for once and for all, and I want people to stop bullying my kids. It's justup. Let's go downstairs. He's outside. &gt;&gt; ROB: My mom is clearly serious, so obviously I'm gonna do whatever she needs me to do. But I feel like Khloe would just think the whole thing's ridiculous. That's my sister, I think we all know that. 277 00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:08,647 I think the whole situation is, like, absurd. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: Yeah, perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is everyone? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have no idea. Everybody's gone. I swear, Khloe. I mean, it's like I don't even live here. I don't even exist here. Really? All right. Maybe I'll use... 286 00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,819 Thanks, babe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...my God. This is amazing! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's like a mini version of your house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been renovating our new offices for months now, and it's finally the day that I get to show it off to Kourtney and Kim. This is the little intern office. This is the kitchen. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so cool that you have a kitchen, so you guys can, like, sit down and chill. I love that. It's really cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't it great? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, I just got this e-mail. The space I want for Dash is available. &gt;&gt; KIM: The space you want for Dash? What are you talking about? Like, you're just looking by yourself? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do everything by myself. I do the buying by myself. I literally-- When has anyone done anything for Dash besides me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, that's, like, something that we're all supposed to, like, do together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But no one else does anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney thinks that she is the president of Dash and that she's the only person that can make decisions for it, and that's just not the case. So, if I wasn't with you right now and you got that e-mail about the Dash space, like, would you have even told me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Probably not. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, that's a problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: We have to do everything for Dash together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, but that's not how it is anymore. Last time, I brought Sheiva with me because you had a dentist appointment, and then I met... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, that I couldn't cancel. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine, come with me next time. I'm going, I'm going to look... &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to be a part of it. You're always trying to, like, kick me out of Dash. It's so weird. It seems like the only schedule that matters is Kourtney's and no one else's, and if you don't fit into her schedule, then she'll drop you. Kourtney just sometimes forgets that Dash is the three of us. I can get a realtor and set it all up and have him organize everything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have a realtor. I have it all set up. I think it's annoying that now that Kim's life has slowed down and she has some time and wants to feel like she's involved in the store again, I'm the bitch who's leaving her out, 'cause she had a dentist appointment. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Checking my e-mails. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, you can't eat, like, a bag of chips up here on the brand-new couch. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I'm really careful, 'cause I know it's bothering you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you've got chip crumbs all over your computer and all over the side of the couch. And you can't put the drink on the brand-new table. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey... &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not cool. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let me get one more chip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, take-- no. You got to take this downstairs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm not leaving. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go. This is so disrespectful. We just finished decorating the room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm going downstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My wife is driving me crazy. First, she's mad that I'm not here, and then she's mad that I'm here. Now I can't even sit on my own furniture. No matter what I do, I can't win with Kris. Honey, I don't even feel like I'm wanted here anymore. I don't even sleep up here anymore. I've, like, had enough of this. I'm really fed up. This is not the woman I married 21 years ago. Have a nice time. The offer to go over to Khloe's house to stay there? I'm taking her up on it. It'll be nice and quiet over there. I like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. This feels cold to me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim's criticizing the spaces that I like the best. &gt;&gt; KIM: Warm it up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, you're just really negative about every space that we see. I'm so over Kim. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've absolutely had enough of this house. The offer to go over to Khloe's house to stay there while she's in Dallas? You know what? I'm taking her up on it. 367 00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:50,162 Hey, it'll be nice and quiet over there. I like that. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Syd! &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm here. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: So, you'll channel Rob in this room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is this the old Rob room? &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: This is the old Rob room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's the old Rob room. Cool! &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: Make yourself comfortable. We have a full bar downstairs, snacks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go check it out. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: I'll be in my office. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: You make yourself at home. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: Of course. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A whole pineapple? This is good stuff. Scotty! What's happening, buddy? You'll never guess where I am. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: On the golf course? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, I'm over at Khloe and Lamar's. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I left the house because it's just so chaotic and it's like they don't even know I'm there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I may stop by to see you. I got to see what you look like in L-O's house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'll see you in a minute. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I'll see you in a second. &gt;&gt; BOTH: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruce, where the hell are ya?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: TV room watching a basketball game. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wow. You have really set up shop in here. Oh! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. So, anyway, this is an experiment; see if anybody misses me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kendall and Kylie will notice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Lately, they've been ignoring me, too. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, but they're at that age. I mean, they have their first car, they're running around. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Teenage girls. Kris is the luckiest girl in the world. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think any guy could live with her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not a chance. &gt;&gt; BOTH: I keep thinking... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was sent from heaven for her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, you're not even sleeping in bed with her anymore, right? Like me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're not allowed in the new room, I thought. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have conjugal visits. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know how we 413 00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:37,469 got in these positions in life that neither of us sleep with our women. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is having a major freak-out because I haven't been involving her in seeing the Dash spaces, but I'm more than happy to go show her the spaces that I've been looking at. &gt;&gt; JAY: So, 1,250 feet at $17 a foot all in. So you're comparing that to Melrose, which is $15,000 for 2,000 feet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, it's bugging me... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, you can make it whatever you want. That's what's annoying about you is that you cannot see the vision. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but look, it's long like this. I like built-ins. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You put built-ins. You build them in. Are you like... You're so annoying. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't see, like, the shell of it. Sure. I hate to that you look at and it's, like, a gas station. &gt;&gt; JAY: There is a gas station there. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just gonna be a lot of work in here. I feel like it's cold. We would definitely warm it up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, you're just really negative about every space that we see. At this point, I'm so over Kim. She has done no work for the store, she's criticizing all the spaces that I like the best when she just can't picture it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. This feels cold to me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: To come in this late in the game when I've been looking is, like, pointless. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't even ask her to come with me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're kind of turning into a little bit of a control freak. Read the letter. Those are my feelings. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't care about your letter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me the respect of reading the damn letter! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I left for two days. 449 00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:24,877 Nobody called! Either it's gonna change or I'm the hell out of here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rack 'em. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's a tight rack, baby. See what you got. Oh! Oh! That's a bad start for me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott, have you been over to my house? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was there for a second just to grab something, and then I saw Kris, and I says, "Where's Bruce?" And she goes, "Uh, I assume he's in the garage." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why don't you call the house... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...and just ask if Bruce is there? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just to see what they say? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, see what they say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. 466 00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:15,494 What are you doing, baby? Um, yeah, I think so. Hold on, okay? Hey, Bruce, line one. It's Scott. Bruce, line one. It's Scott. Hey, Scott, I don't know where he is. Can I have him call you back? Okay, thanks, baby. I'll talk to you later. Okay, love you, too. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What about going home and just telling everybody how you feel and just being honest and say, "This is my house, too. And I want to have an opinion that counts, not just to be ignored"? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. Maybe it's the right thing to do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For once, you're in a weirder place than I am. It's pretty nice. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I pulled that. &gt;&gt; ROYA: I like it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't pick this color. Which color did the best? &gt;&gt; ROYA: The blue. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So let's do that in the blue. Me and Roya are downtown at at the Mason By Michelle Mason showroom. &gt;&gt; ROYA: Your over the one-shoulder thing, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me see. I'm the buyer, and I do everything for our Dash stores. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had to come downtown and check out Lamar's lofts down here while they're in Dallas. I called your house, and they said that you were down here. Where's Kim? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She doesn't like to do this kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She should be here shopping with you guys so that she's more hands-on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's busy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, she's not busy. I just spoke to her an hour ago before I came down here. Kourtney and Kim have really been arguing a lot lately about Dash, and it's kind of gotten out of hand. Roya and I are in and out. We got a groove going on. Kim doesn't know what we need because she hasn't done this in a long time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe that's why you need to include her, exactly. When you guys first started these stores, Kourtney, you guys did it together. You're sisters. It breaks my heart to see that these kids are fighting because one's not doing enough or one's not including the other. You're kind of turning into a little bit of a control freak without wanting her... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've always been a control freak. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but it's more evident now because you don't want her involved, and that's not fair. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, you do have a point. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get her reinvolved and tell her you need her now more than ever. She'll add her own little twist and her own fashion and so it does reflect all three of you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I already said I agree. We will include her next time and include her in the store. Even though I do a lot of the work, I definitely see my mom's point. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Dash. You want to buy it? You're welc. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really can't let my controlling ways affect letting my sisters being involved in the store because it is something that the three of us built together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just think it's a really good idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know she needs it for her life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She does need it for her life. She needs to be needed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, don't get me started again. I'll have to smack you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, thank you. 529 00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:06,064 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Next time, you'll see Kim, I'm sure. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Going back to the house, it seems like this experiment is not working. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. Babe, what are you doing? What's going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't you wonder where the hell I've been for the last couple of days? Have you called? I haven't even been here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean, you haven't even been here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was at Khloe's for the last two days! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Bruce, calm down. Just talk to me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I shouldn't calm down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you so angry? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's 'cause it's the way I'm treated around the house. Made a point. Left for two days. You didn't even call. Nobody called! &gt;&gt; KRIS:I thought you were downstairs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is not funny, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're always around. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everybody shows me absolutely no respect whatsoever. I'm sick and tired of it. Either it's gonna change or I'm the hell out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When Khloe gets here, I need a little bit of help. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just the whole DNA thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But is she says no, you need to respect that. 554 00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,931 &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not gonna accept "No." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They've got a lot going on, babe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I'm absolutely ignored in the process. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, it goes both ways; you also have to earn your respect, so if you don't think you're getting any respect, then be a part of the family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You never talk to me. All you girls. I mean, this is, like, the new picture. This is how you girls are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because we're all working. I'm trying to keep us afloat. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you totally ignore me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can understand, on some level, where you're coming from and all of a sudden that you want to be included in everything, but if you want to know what's going on, Bruce, then you need to act like you're part of the team again. You haven't been part of the team in a really long time. Bruce can complain that we all ignore him, but the truth is, he is MIA 24/7. Speak up once in a while and act like you care what's going on around here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I flew out to LA because Kourt has asked Kim and I to meet at our potential new Dash store. Oh, my God... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've seen you wear that shirt in "Who Wore It Best?" Yeah, it's "Who Wore It Best, Khloe or Nicole Richie?" And Nicole Richie did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I didn't know. Thanks, that was good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think this space has a lot of potential. I feel really good about it, but now I need to get Kim and Khloe on board. Are you excited? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The new Dash. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, what are our ideas? &gt;&gt; JEFF: So, this is the new, like, design scheme that we've come up with. There's a lot of white, a little bit of black and tiny, like, touches of gold. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Pay attention. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Ladies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, pay attention. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like I'm in school. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Right here's the dressing room, and then right outside of this, shelving. The same mannequins as in New York. This will be mirrored, 'cause this door is so tall. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is the floors gonna be? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Really shiny white. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, what do we think, guys? Is this the next Dash? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I love it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm very excited that we're back in business with all three of us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you need me to fly in, you've just to say something, and I'll fly in. I fly in for anything else. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm definitely gonna make myself more available, so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I just never even thought you cared. That's why I never would ask you when I would go to do the buying. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I do care. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I literally would never even dream to ask. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I care about this outfit, even more, that you've got on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look like RuPaul with that necktie. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does RuPaul wear bolo ties? &gt;&gt; KIM: No one should wear bolo ties. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I always forget how much fun the three of us have when we actually are working together, and had so many fun memories at the original Dash store, I hope we continue to have at our new Dash store. Bye, guys. Bye, Khlo, love you. Hey, Bruce, you eating alone? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm the only one for dinner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And the Mase man shows up; get over here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm having a family dinner tonight. Everybody's gonna be here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's nice to have everybody get together and kind of go over what's been going on in everybody's crazy-busy lives. Because how else is everybody gonna find out about it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do we know yet, boy or girl? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We found out today. We're having a girl. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There goes my theory. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And Bruce thought it was a boy. I am excited to have a girl, to have a new experience. I'm really excited for Mason to not have to compete with a little brother. They said it was 99%. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you guys have to do me a favor when Khloe gets here, I need a little bit of help. You need to... Well, just the whole DNA thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, just ignore all that stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We do, we all... &gt;&gt; KIM: We do, but when Khloe calls me hysterically crying, asking me for answers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, she obviously has doubts. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's afraid it's not her real dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: And that's sad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm on team Khloe, so whatever Khloe is comfortable with, that's what I want. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why, why are you on team Khloe? Why don't you be on team Mom for once in your life? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but if she says no, you need to respect that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not gonna accept "No." 645 00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:37,228 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe made it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We've all agreed to do a DNA test. This is Dr. Taddie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously? I don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just wish she would just do it; I don't get it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, we just got some great news. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I told them what we're having. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I already knew. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, I know has just had it with me torturing her over this swab test, but I'm really hoping that if the rest of the family feels like it's a good idea, that she will, too. Khloe, I need your help. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really feel like it's important for you to know that Daddy is your real dad. And we've all agreed to do a DNA test. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is just dumb, so. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not stupid, and you do care. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not stupid to you; you're the one who wrote that you had an affair about however many years ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was 25 years ago, and I wrote a memoir, okay? When you write a memoir... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Memoir. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...you have to, like, tell your life story. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Memoir. Memoir. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And what most people want to know is why I got divorced from Daddy, so I told my story; there's nothing wrong with that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what opened up the floodgates, the age, the... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, what opened up the floodgates, Khloe, if you'll remember correctly, is two of your dad'sex-wives. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, watch your mouth in front of my son. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, are you drunk? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not, actually. I'm angry because you're blaming this on me, when it wasn't me who started this rumor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all, Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was two other That you are, like, even, considering that their information be correct when they're just out to get press. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not blaming anything on you. Relax, stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Then why wouldn't you just want to get a DNA test and put it to rest. Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Leave me alone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: People are out there saying that, like, your dad isn't your dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I don't care what they're saying. 'Cause everyone's called me fat, do you want me to go get lipo? No one's gonna help me out? If I don't want to do something, no one's gonna help me out? &gt;&gt; KIM: I heard that pain in your voice when you called me that morning, and I know it was fresh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I'm over it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but over it or not, there's somewhere in the back of your mind that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't care, and I'm not doing this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're only here for a night, and the doctor is coming over. This is Dr. Taddie. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously? My dad is Robert Kardashian. My other dad is Bruce Jenner. If youother people during the same time, and you do Maury. Like, I don't care. Don't mean any disrespect, but I don't want to take a test, and I didn't know this was happening. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: Oh, no worries whatsoever. None whatsoever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sorry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Way to go, honey, on another good one. Let's hear it for Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought we'd moved past this. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is so easily proved. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But this is not what I wanted to come here and do. You guys, get off my case. Seriously, it's annoying. &gt;&gt; KIM: The only way we'll get off is if you do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, that's rude. Because I'm not on your case about a lot ofthat I should be on. &gt;&gt; TADDIE: You think this bothers her deep down? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, somebody said it, and in this world, once you say it or it's printed, it makes it real. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I came in here, and I was ambushed. &gt;&gt; KIM: We just want to do something for you. Like, this is all about you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it's-it's actually not all about me. It's actually about Mom. She is cussing and yelling. I don't know why; no one was yelling back at her. The woman is psychotic. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, her delivery is awful, but he's here and it takes two seconds, literally. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just wish she would just do it and get it over with. And then it's done, you know? And she's not over it. She's just not over it. 724 00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:19,584 She's in there saying she's over it. I don't get it. Hi, gorg. I didn't sleep a wink last night. I'm completely stressed out over this whole DNA thing. So, I've asked Kim if she'll go to lunch with me today just so I can talk it out. I'm having major anxiety... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Over the whole Khloe thing, and I can't resolve it unless she helps me resolve it. Like, I really need her to understand the way I'm feeling. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know my mom so well that I know her heart means well, but I think maybe her approach was a little off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She laughs about it, but she's not laughing on the inside. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's her own insecurity, and I get that, but I think you, inside, feel like maybe, "I don't like that people are saying this about me." You know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It-it's a reflection on both of us; it's not... &gt;&gt; KIM: I think she thinks, though, that you're, like, trying to sneakily do it "for her," but it's really for you. My mom obviously wants her reputation to be cleared, but she can't really articulate that to Khloe. I think that you're coming off so much like, "This is all for you, Khloe-- everything I do is for you," when, like, you want it for yourself, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do want it for myself, and I realize that. That's why I can't sleep at night-- because it's... &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, don't be so dramatic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I can't. It's keeping me up at night. I feel like there's a little bit of a shadow of doubt with Khloe, and that kills me. I just want to be able to put it to bed for once and for all. No pun intended. I wish Khloe would just let me prove to her that Robert Kardashian is her biological father. Not only for her, but for me, too, because it really feels lousy when you feel like your children might doubt you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think they'll really like the space. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The new store? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. It's right across from Diane von Furstenberg. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a great location right there. &gt;&gt; KIM: We need an opening party and hire, like, a PR team. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I come to the opening party? 765 00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:36,354 &gt;&gt; KIM: Nope. Only biological mothers allowed. &gt;&gt; KRIS:Perfect. &gt;&gt; KYLIE:I have two text messages. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's dinner? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They've been on their cell phones the entire time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, did you finish? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm trying to sit down and talk to them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you eat something good? Guys? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: For any parent, it's fun to watch your kids grow up. And then they become teenagers. They kind of leave the nest. And that's tough on a dad. Kris is right-- I do need to speak up in this family. And, you know, with Kendall and Kylie, I've got just the right way to deal with this. We're going for a ride. Let's go. Give me the cell phone. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why would you take my cell? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look, just give it to me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's fine. You're going to be fine. No cell phones. I love it. Let's go get some yogurt. Have a little family time like the old days. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Which one are you getting, honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm getting a little vanilla/chocolate with hot fudge on top. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you guys have at school tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Huge test. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In what? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Science, but I'm probably going to fail this one. I don't know one thing. I haven't even been there for any of the lessons. Like, how frustrating is it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: When you miss one class, you miss a whole chapter. And we don't just miss to miss. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You miss 'cause you have a job. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We miss 'cause we're working. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I want to work. Like, I want to do it, but I... it's so hard to keep up. I sit there in class, and I don't know anything. And it makes me feel so dumb just 'cause everyone's on the same... a different level than me. Like, it's so frustrating. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I had no idea that Kylie was having problems in, uh, science. I just can't believe that I'm not noticing the things that are going on in their life right now. What can we do to help you get that science grade up? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: A tutor, so I can be at my own level. Like, I want to do good in school, like, really bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, this is amazing because this is probably the most talking we've done in months. Get those cell phones out of your hands, and look what happens-- they just communicate. This is wonderful. In the future with this family-- communicate, communicate, communicate. And for doing so much talking, you can have your cell phone back. Okay, good-bye. See you next time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you, guys, very much. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was delicious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See? They're right back at it. But at least we talked. This is wonderful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom. Hey. I'm glad you're here 'cause I have a question. I'm replacing my showerhead. Would you like this one or this one? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does the guy come with the showerhead? 'Cause, if he does, I'm getting two: one for me... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's really excited to be in this picture. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's really happy. Sometimes, when I want to have a really serious conversation with Khloe, I find that she tunes me out after a few minutes if she doesn't want to hear what I have to say, so I decided to write her a letter. This was the best way that I could communicate what I finally wanted to say to her. I know that we have a hard time with the whole DNA subject. I'm a little nervous to talk to you about this anymore. I don't say whatever... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this really still going on? You know, I'm still not happy with my mom and me being ambushed about this whole DNA situation. If I wanted to get a paternity test, I would. I don't care about your letter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I'm saying is, read the letter. Those are my feelings. If you choose not to do it, it's a free country. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. Just read the damn letter and hear what's in my heart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one's asking you to get angry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's all I'm asking. Just, that's the respect... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need a glass of wine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, maybe I do. I think I'm going to go get one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This isn't a... 849 00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:38,062 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just give me the respect of reading the damn letter-- that's all I'm saying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Dearest Khloe, I fell in love with you and will always remember the look on Daddy's face when you were born. He was so happy and so excited that you were a blondie and gave Nana all the credit. Even made your grandmother, MJ, a little jealous, I think." &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's important to me is for Khloe to get where she comes from. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Daddy and I were so very close, and I know in my heart that he, too, would want to set the record straight." &gt;&gt; KRIS: It makes me just so ridiculously sad to think that she wouldn't believe that Rob was her dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "I'm humbly asking you to do this for me so that we can find some closure to this very disturbing subject. Especially since Daddy isn't here to help me himself. 865 00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:36,654 I love you more than you will ever know. Mommy." You're just shooting some pool? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, just hanging out. I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you, too. And I love your letter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was so nice. I love that part about Nana and MJ being jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When you were little. Took me two hours to write that letter. I just wrote what was in my heart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I appreciate your letter, and it means a lot to me, but... you have to respect me, too. Let's just let bygones be bygones. I am an Odom anyway. I'm not a Kardashian anymore, so let's move on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'm... I'm over it, too, by this point. I'm just tired. The whole thing's making me tired. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So let's just forget about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I'm tired of fighting this fight, and if Khloe's okay with, you know, this whole situation, then I've got to be okay with it, to move on and just go back to being a good mom. I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you, too, and thank you for my letter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks for reading it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. What my mom needs to truly understand is: I don't have a doubt about who my family is. I have had a blessing of having two phenomenal fathers, and I don't need a DNA test to prove that to me. Why are you so dressed up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause I just came from a meeting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow! Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sorry. Not that you didn't deserve it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That hurt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what? Sometimes, life hurts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kim, come back. Dad, that was not cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are we going to do to get Dad back? What if someone steals the Ferrari? You have this resentment towards Mom. Maybe it would be good to just, like, sit down with her and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would rather die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you going to punish me for the rest of mylife?
