- &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a cute top. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Golce and Dabbana." &gt;&gt; KRIS: How exciting that we locked down Oprah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have no idea. Oprah is like my dream of life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so exciting to get a call from Oprah's office, saying, "Hi. Oprah would like to interview your whole family, and she'll come to you." Oprah's coming to our house. Are you guys nervous? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm nervous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, we're all a little nervous. It is, by the way, Oprah, queen of talk shows. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom, what are guys supposed to wear? What are you having Bruce wear? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You should just take your shirt off and show her all your tats. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, if I had a six-pack or... actually, I wouldn't want a six-pack. If I had a four-pack, I would definitely... &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye is coming over today, with his stylist, and he's giving me a full clothing makeover. &gt;&gt; RENELOU: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; RENELOU: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so nervous. Did you look through my stuff? &gt;&gt; RENELOU: No, not yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: You haven't even seen my closet? &gt;&gt; RENELOU: No, not yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye has definitely inspired me to want to be a little bit more of an individual. I think my style's just evolving and changing, and I think it should, because that's, you know, what life is about. Is it so bad to keep things? &gt;&gt; KANYE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's a fashion designer and he loves clothes, so... I'm excited to, like, collaborate with him to see what his take on fashion is. Okay, there's a little explaining to do. Like, I know these are really... &gt;&gt; RENELOU: Yeah, that's probably why... &gt;&gt; KIM: I know! &gt;&gt; RENELOU: It's a dog bag, no? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's not. &gt;&gt; KANYE: The shearling... like, the shearling. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like it's so ironic that I'm the one that's always giving my friends, like, their closet makeovers... so, for the roles to be reversed, like, oh, my God... &gt;&gt; RENELOU: These can go. For sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Okay, do we not like these? &gt;&gt; KANYE: Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; KIM: No! No, no-no-no. I need these. Oh, yes, yes. But shouldn't I keep this for, like, my daughter one day? &gt;&gt; RENELOU: Um... &gt;&gt; KANYE: Sometimes silence is the best response. 47 00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:41,662 You have to let her do her thing; she's a professional. &gt;&gt; KIM: Baby steps. &gt;&gt; KANYE: How do you feel, baby? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, I'm literally crying. Our whole trade-off was that, like, if I got rid of all my clothes, he would fill up my closet, but I'm freaking out. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Look how dope this is. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's all the dopest stuff. Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't my boobs look so much better if they look like this? &gt;&gt; KANYE: No, 'cause I like natural-looking. 58 00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:32,179 &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't. &gt;&gt; KANYE: 'Cause I grew up on, like, '80s... um... magazines. &gt;&gt; RENELOU: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Kanye has definitely given me a push to want to see more that's out there in the world, so I think that's, like, a really good thing. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Look, see? New Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. You know what the thing with me is? I might, like, throw a fit and, like, cry inside now, but then, like, once I'm on some new , then I'll laugh at myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so you know that Kanye had his, like, stylist come over... This is everything we're getting rid of. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Okay, wait, we gotta stop. No... This is... Bible, you're freaking me out. It's all, Bible? All of them, Kim? Like, okay. Okay, you're not getting rid of all these. &gt;&gt; KIM: I show Khloe all the stuff that Kanye's stylist have kind of, like, pulled out of my closet to get rid of, and Khloe's freaking out. And maybe it was a bad idea to have her come over here and see everything that I'm gonna get rid of. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know I love these. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. He said they are so ghetto. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love ghetto fab. You got to have a little ghetto in your life. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I got to change a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but having a little oomph? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. So, come look in the closet. Hey, are you ready to faint? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You... Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bible, I don't like 88 00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:22,355 this. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is all I was left with when I walked in. Look. She did go through here and tag everything of what she thought I didn't need anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everything is tagged! Kim's makeover is crazy. It's full wardrobe is getting removed, and it's a lot for me to handle. It's not even happening to me. Like, I'm having a major breakdown. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're, like, mad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't like, like, you're getting-- I feel like half of that stuff I have, so are you saying that I am a dresser? &gt;&gt; ROB: So, I'm in Vegas to be a judge in the Miss USA pageant. And Kim is also here in Vegas 'cause she's doing an appearance, so hopefully we'll link up. Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. &gt;&gt; ROB: What's up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's Vegas? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm at Planet Hollywood just killing some time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You feeling good about your show tonight? &gt;&gt; ROB: The suit's, like, really crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I wish I was there to see you. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're just at home working. You could be here working, too, you know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really not true. I can't be 27 places at the same time, and all of you guys are all spread out this week. &gt;&gt; ROB: I've been trying to open up this men's Dash store for a long time now, and you really could care less. I've always wanted to open up a men's Dash store, and I feel like my mom doesn't take me seriously, and it's frustrating because she, you know, obviously puts a lot more attention to my sisters. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not fair for you to tell me that I don't care about something when I care very much about you. Just have a really good show tonight. Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I love you, too. &gt;&gt; CICI: Hold on! You're so annoying! Top D! &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you excited for Teen Miss USA? Are you gonna meet a girl? &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, it's Teen? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know what it is. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's Miss USA pageant. &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ROB: I have to ask them a question or two. &gt;&gt; KIM: "I need to make out with all of you." &gt;&gt; CICI: That is hysterical. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that Rob has so many great opportunities, and hosting Miss USA is perfect for him. &gt;&gt; CICI: Are you doing the sock line? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CICI: You are?! &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CICI: We need to have them in the store. What's the name? &gt;&gt; ROB: Arthur George. &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, okay, perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: But our high-end clothing line is Robert George. &gt;&gt; ROB: So? &gt;&gt; KIM: It might be kind of weird. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why is it weird? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, well, it might conflict. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's not going to conflict, 'cause your mother, your manager's never once said a single thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: You make no sense when you talk. &gt;&gt; ROB: How did that not make 145 00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:06,252 sense? You should know that those names are all in our family. You acted like my idea was crazy. I have, like, more right than you to use Arthur George. It's my middle name. It's crazy to me how she actually is trying to tell me that I can't use my middle name, my dad's middle name. We're family. Like, you're supposed to help each other, and I feel like nobody ever takes me seriously. &gt;&gt; CICI: That could work. &gt;&gt; ROB: I know you know. Kim obviously doesn't know. She thinks everything's about herself, apparently. &gt;&gt; KIM: If it's already done, it's already done. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's my middle name. End of story. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's so dramatic. I'm not even gonna start to begin to describe these bursts that my brother has towards me, and then he storms off. It just doesn't make sense to me. I feel like the things I would even, like, trip about before aren't even on my radar. Like when I see Rob and things like that? I'm just like, "Grow up." 165 00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:16,156 &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here celebrating the launch of my new fragrance. I have to run! Bye! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; REPORTER: I actually interviewed your mom. Did she give you any advice on being a judge? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, she didn't. &gt;&gt; REPORTER 2: Kanye, hanging out a lot? &gt;&gt; ROB: He's cool. I mean, I'm a huge fan. Yeah, he's awesome. I started my own sock company, so I'm very happy about that. &gt;&gt; REPORTER 3: Well, each of your sister has the "It" factor. &gt;&gt; ROBIN LEACH: And did you speak with sister Kim while she was in town today? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, she's in... Yeah-yeah, we hung out for a bit, so... &gt;&gt; LEACH: Today? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, yeah. So she was excited. &gt;&gt; LEACH: Very good. She's not coming here, is she? &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Thank you. No, she's not. &gt;&gt; ROB: No. It's really difficult whenever I have to do a red carpet event and then, like all the questions get reversed back to my sisters. It just gets frustrating. &gt;&gt; ARSENIO: I'll tell you how you affected my life-- I wear different socks now. &gt;&gt; ROB: Really? &gt;&gt; ALI: I like socks, too. I just tweeted pictures of, like, crazy socks the other day. &gt;&gt; ARSENIO: You know that's why they put us together. This is the sock crew. &gt;&gt; ALI: 'Cause we love the socks! &gt;&gt; ROB: Feels great to get the love and respect about my sock line from, you know, people who aren't even, you know, family to me. I just met them. And it sucks when, you know, my mom doesn't really back me. And especially, like, you know, one of my sisters. &gt;&gt; ALI: We know how to get your vote. You just need to walk down 198 00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,868 in some socks. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. My socks. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...were going to check if Kourtney and I could do that line. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes, with Mowad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. You guys want to do one together? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to do it together or solo? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'd kind of rather together, don't you? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So are we seeing a few different concepts or...? &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: No, you're seeing one concept, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. My sisters and my mom and I are having a business meeting to discuss a future potential makeup line. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: This is really cool. It's a double-ended lipstick. We're launching with a suite of mascaras. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's beautiful packaging. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I don't like that. 'Cause I think having the different shapes to differentiate which one is which is fine, but I really think it should stay within, like, a graphite family. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: One of the things that we're super excited about are the lash-def powder bar. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, very cute with the eye shadows. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think the girls are so great at knowing what their fans love and... &gt;&gt; KIM: But I also think our fans need to evolve with us. Like, I don't wear lashes anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It just frustrates me that now that Kim is on a certain kick, she thinks, like, what she does is, like, the way things should be. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: We gave you a couple of different ideas for brand names, and I think immediately everybody gravitated towards "Khroma," which we're super happy about 'cause we love that, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, "Kardashian Khroma"? &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Makeup is what we wanted to do for so long. And I just want the name to stand out. And any meeting that you have, if they bring you packaging, you're not just gonna like everything from the start. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: Let me see exactly what we can and can't do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's frustrating that Kim doesn't want "Kardashian" in the name. our name. So shouldn't really hate it. It's gotten you pretty far in life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oprah's coming for lunch. Today is the big day. Oprah is gonna interview my entire family. &gt;&gt; ALL: Hi! &gt;&gt; ROB: I told you this for years. Kim is selfish, obviously. Doesn't ever want to include me in anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: You sound like a idiot! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's one of the most 245 00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,871 horrific feelings to watch your kids fight with each other. This is crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know why Kim is always saying, like, she's tired of it being three sisters. three sisters, and it does hurt my feelings when she says stuff like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; ROB: So, Mom, I was saying, like, my income right now is really bad. I don't have anything coming in. I mean, I have the sock thing. So, like, how are you gonna 255 00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:55,401 figure out about opening that store? Lamar and I want to do that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not being selfish. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim wants all the attention and wants, like, everything to be about her. And my mom, like, gives her all of that. So, you know, it does affect my business and what I want to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not really. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wonder if Oprah eats coffee cake. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Go put your dress on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. This needs to go in there. Today is the big day. Oprah is gonna interview my entire family, and I am so excited. I just want everything to be perfect. Do you want me to help you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You never help me. For Oprah, you help. Oprah, I'm gonna just die. Oh, my God, it's already. Okay, we gotta unzip it for now. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Why are you getting all hot and bothered? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm getting anxiety, you guys! Scott, don't come near me! I'm sweating already. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does my hair look okay? &gt;&gt; ROB: They all say I'm balding. I'm, like, "That's just where the hair grows." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Damn! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Excuse me, baby. Oh, there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! Five minutes, five minutes. &gt;&gt; JULIE: I'm telling your sister, you guys pretend like Oprah's just one of your friends who you're showing your room and your closet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There's so much going on today. From the second I walk outside my bedroom, it's just people and people. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Of course, my favorite daughter's down here first. Everyone back here. Kendall, we need you. Rob? Where's Scott? Lamar? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Come on, sugar... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're having a guest! We're having a guest! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: We need to clear the set 'cause we can see you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Somebody's at the door. &gt;&gt; ALL: Hi! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, it's Oprah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am definitely nervous for this interview with Oprah. Especially with Scott. He could be a complete... &gt;&gt; OPRAH: You are known as the black sheep of the family. You know that, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: We do everything together. I would love something on my own. 301 00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,177 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim wanting to branch out and do things on her own? That's insulting to me. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oprah, how are you? &gt;&gt; OPRAH: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nice to see you. Welcome to our home. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on in. Welcome! &gt;&gt; OPRAH/KRIS: Here they come! &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm Kim. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oprah, she's like everybody's aunt. The one lady that you never met but you feel like you could talk to her or be yourself around. Just to meet her, mind-blowing. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: You know, people always say to me, "Oh, you look better than you do on TV." I think you look just as good as you do on TV, 'cause I think when people say you look better, that's... I think, "Well, that's too bad." &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Do I look really awful on television?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're like, "You are so much thinner than I thought." I'm like, "Thank you." &gt;&gt; OPRAH: I know. Believe me. I get that a lot. Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think we're gonna go over to this staircase, family, and do some photos. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: "Yay" makes a good photograph. I tell all my girls at school. One, two... &gt;&gt; ALL: Yay! &gt;&gt; ROB: First it's, like, a group photo. And then it goes, like, my mom and Bruce, Lamar and Khloe, Scott and Kourtney, Oprah, whatever. And then it's like... &gt;&gt; JULIE: Kim. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Thanks, Kim. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oprah and, like, just Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall and Kylie and then... and Rob. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Rob. Hi, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: And then I'm, like, on the end and, like, Kendall's, like, towering over me. I don't even want to be a part of this. Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, man. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm doing the Arthur George thing with the socks, and then I'm gonna extend underwear and, like, undershirts. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that would be perfect. &gt;&gt; ROB: With the same name. But Lamar would want to be involved, too, but Lamar doesn't even care about the name. He just wants to be involved. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It would be awesome. I would probably do anything I could to help Rob out in a business sense just because, you know, I think he's struggling a little bit. He just doesn't really know how to focus and put his mind to things, and he's kind of used to his mother doing things for him. He needs to understand that being a man, sometimes you have to do everything on your own. The sock deal is signed, though, right? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but I need to get the contracts finished. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: I get you confused. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, Kylie. Kendall is the tall one. Her name is longer. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Okay, Kendall is the tall one. Her name is longer. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kylie is shorter. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: A shorter clone. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Okay. No. No, someone said to me, "They... Well, Kendall has dark hair." Everybody has dark hair in this family! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CINDY: Okay, so, Lamar and Khloe are going first and then you and Kourtney are second. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna get a couple of Kleenex. I feel, like, a tear coming on. Oh, yeah. It's gonna be a crier. &gt;&gt; CREW MEMBER: Watch the cables, guys. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: I think Lamar needs some powder right here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at Lamar's head getting all touched up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are my Spanx rolling down? &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Your-your Spanx are looking good. You can't see them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Perfect! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: We go first, so it's a little different from, you know, being able to peep the scene and see how it was going. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: I would think when you marry a sister and the sisters are always in each other's lives, do you ever want to tell the sisters to butt out? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No, not really. They-they let us live. She's strong with them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am definitely nervous for this interview with Oprah. &gt;&gt; CREW MEMBER 2: They're on their last question, so you should probably go upstairs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Especially with Scott. He could open up, he could be a complete... You never know what you're gonna get. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: You are known as the black sheep of the family. You know that, right? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. I mean, I can't ever take back some of the things I've said or done, and I hate when people we know and the public will be like, "Oh, she's such a pushover for him. He's such a" &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Well, you may not be a &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I'm not claiming I'm not aat all. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I-I don't want to... I'm not trying to... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He definitely has that in him. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: You're not claiming that you're not a? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I'm just saying I've definitely had some tendencies. It's not the easiest thing to answer questions about times that you were in bad places in your life, but, you know, if you could turn things around for the better, you know, that's all that really matters. &gt;&gt; SHERI: It was really, really good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, I appreciate it. I'm sure you've seen a lot of people. &gt;&gt; SHERI: I have indeed. I was the executive producer of The Oprah and then president of Harpo and now president of OWN, too, so I've seen... I've seen people do this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow. &gt;&gt; SHERI: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Huh? Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How long until your mom cries, do you think? &gt;&gt; KIM: Five minutes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Two minutes. &gt;&gt; SHERI: Really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna... I'm gonna go eight minutes. &gt;&gt; SHERI: Is she-is she emotional? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A crier? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Very. She's probably gonna cry right now. : "Here's the iced tea. I can't do it. I just can't." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott, in the beginning, was very, very young. Very young. He was a boy. And now Scott's turned into the most amazing young man and the best dad. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Would you say you grew to love him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. Ugh. I cry. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I got her to cry. I killed it. You're welcome, Oprah's production. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo. &gt;&gt; PEARL: The girls are about to start their interview. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; PEARL: And then about, like, 30 minutes into it, they'll pull you in. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kim will have the most dramatic questions. I mean, she's got the most dramatic life. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: So, you know there are all these rumors. Are you and Kanye together as a publicity stunt? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I couldn't sacrifice my heart for a publicity stunt. Like, why would I want to be with someone that, you know... How could you, like... &gt;&gt; OPRAH: So it's real? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Kim, that was beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oprah has a way of making you feel really comfortable. She's so warm and so present, and I'm really glad that I did do a solo interview. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what just happened there, but that was delicious. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: That was delicious. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, it makes me want to cry for you. You said the most amazing things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, do you feel left out or something? He asked why is he here. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's fine. I know we're doing the family thing at the end, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, we're doing one with me, Kim, and Khlo and then you're coming in to that one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is like a dream come true for my sisters and I, and I could tell that, you know, Rob kind of feels left out. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know. &gt;&gt; CREW MEMBER 2: Yes, Rob's on the end. &gt;&gt; ROB: Guess so. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: How does the spirit of your father show itself in your daily lives? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We really, I think because of his passing, have become closer and stronger and have taken his morals and values so much more to heart. &gt;&gt; KIM: We sincerely, genuinely love each other. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Do you ever feel like you're living in their shadow? &gt;&gt; ROB: Um, I mean, it's tough but I couldn't be more happy for their success, 'cause they're my sisters and obviously I want the best for them. My dad was an entrepreneur, and that's something that I want to be. Everything they're doing is-is right because of my mom but, more importantly, because of my dad 'cause he was the one who taught everybody. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? We work hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We put in a little work, too. &gt;&gt; ROB: You work hard, but it was all because of our parents. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do think it bothers Rob that he gets compared to us, but I do not think Rob realizes how much work my sisters and I have put into our businesses, and I don't think Rob remembers the struggles that we had and how hard it was and how long it took for things to get going. Half. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Bye. You're speaking to me now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! Say hi. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: I'm so excited. That's a moment. &gt;&gt; KIM: She has a lot of doggies. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: I have five doggies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. &gt;&gt; MASON: Doggies! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What does a doggy say? &gt;&gt; MASON: Ruff ruff! &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Ruff ruff! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This whole Oprah experience overall is so amazing. I think that she really did understand us a lot better after the end of the day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Take care. Travel safe. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: See you on TV! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you, too! Back at ya. How great is she? I'm kind of... have a little Oprah crush right now. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: These are pretty. They're so pretty, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KIM: Gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott got them for me when we were in San Diego. Probably 'cause he went to a strip club. Just kidding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Kim Kardashian's blog gets a makeover." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They've been working on mine for I can't even tell you how long. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I just made mine really simple and all white. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I told her I wanted mine all white, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's, like, an opportunity for me to do my own, like, lingerie line in the Philippines, and it does not conflict with Sears or Jupi or anything, 'cause we don't even have that out there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, you already have Sears and Belle Noel. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's wrong with that? What's wrong with me doing a certain something on my own? I don't think there's anything wrong with that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We feel like we already have our line, and this is something that's supposed to be what we've all said for hopefully the next 20 to 30 years of our lives. Why are you going to taint our water by diluting it? &gt;&gt; KIM: I really don't know why Kourtney and Khloe feel a little bit threatened that I just want to find my own voice. Me doing anything on my own would never affect any project that I do currently with them. They just don't get it. Sometimes I feel like if a deal is brought to me and then I accept the deal and someone else says, "Okay, would the three girls like to do the deal?" And then Mom goes, "Yeah, great!" 'cause she's not paying attention half the time, and I'm like, "Wait a minute." We do everything together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is the three of us, but it also... It's rewarding if we're all there together to experience it. One of the best parts about our business is that I'm working with my sisters, and I don't understand why Kim would want to do those things alone. &gt;&gt; KIM: I, you know, would love something on my own. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get what you're saying, but when it comes to something that is beneficial to all of us, and that's... I never once said, "Why the is Kim on QuickTrim? I don't care. I'm the one who lost the 30 pounds to get the QuickTrim thing. You were brought on second-string. &gt;&gt; KIM: I had QuickTrim first, by the way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you were brought on second... During the conversation, you were brought on. I was the original. I never once said, "Why is Kim on this deal?" Never. Kim wanting to branch out and do things on her own, that's insulting to me. I could do a million things by myself, but it's more of an accomplishment and fun being able to work with your sisters every day. You consider us a charity case that you're giving back to? &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely not. I feel like you guys get mad at me about every little thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Feel like we have a lot to say, and we need a group family therapy session. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim is literally the most selfish person here. Doesn't give aabout if I have a career. &gt;&gt; KIM: My job is to help you out? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're not a charity case; get a job. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really don't believe in therapy, but listening to them fight like this, it's probably a really good idea that we're here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is up with Kim lately? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't even start. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I wore that maxi dress and she's like, "I'm so over these phases. I don't wear maxi dresses." She told me she doesn't wear any. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She just wore one two days ago. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get everyone's doing their own thing. I love that Kim is growing and all of that, but it's about spending time with one another, creating a business with your sisters. I know my dad would be disgusted if he ever knew that business deals and work deals came between my sisters and I. I feel like we need a group family, like, therapy session just with, like, Mom, Rob and us three. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why those people? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like we have a lot to say, and it's... We need a mediator and someone who could, like, volleyball it and, like, make it fine. So therapy needs to happen. Right now, there's some issues between us, and I think with everything that has happened, priorities in life have definitely changed. We just need someone just to help us, like, get through everything. The baby's coming. We need to clear, like, air for the baby. The baby can't be brought into this negative energy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, ho. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, hey, trifling-ass &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, it's time for an intervention. 564 00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:15,687 &gt;&gt; KIM: With what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The entire fam bam. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean? Um, I think that sounds like the most ridiculous thing ever, and I'm not into it. I highly doubt Mom agreed to go. She's, like, so not for therapy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know you think I'm a liar, so go ahead and call your madre. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I'm gonna call her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Word to Big Bird. &gt;&gt; KIM: Peace. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you agree to go to a family therapy session? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, I said that if everybody else was gonna go, I would try to sit through it. I'm not somebody who believes in that stuff, but I think that we should just keep everyone happy and go. Why? You don't want to go? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just not for me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're asking us to go to something that means a lot to them, and this is how they find a release and comfort and it helps them, let's go and see what it's all about and maybe we'll get something out of it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really surprised that my mom is open to going to therapy, 'cause she never has been before. But if this will make them happy, I'll go and support them and just be there. 588 00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:40,772 Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, I heard I called you when I was drunk. I don't even remember-- and I said... &gt;&gt; KIM: "I'm coming to your room!" I'm like, "No, you're not. No, you're not. I'm sleeping, bye." I, like, couldn't think of anything. You're like, "No, I'm coming. I'm coming." I'm like, "Khloe, I'm taking a ," but I was, like, sleeping in bed, and you're like, "No, I'm coming. I'm gonna bang on your door." I go, "No, I have diarrhea! I got to go." Our schedules are kind of hard to pick a date to go to this family therapy, so Kourtney, Jimmy so we're gonna glam up together, go to the therapy session, and then, that way, we won't have to rush before we Jimmy Kimmel. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob said he wants to open a Dash in London. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim, is that okay with you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you guys fighting so much? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not. I'm asking Princess Kim. Princess Kimberly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you so angry all the time? &gt;&gt; ROB: 'Cause Kim is literally the most selfish person here, and doesn't give aabout if I have a career. All she cares about is herself. I told you this for years. Kim is selfish, obviously, doesn't ever want to include me in anything... &gt;&gt; KIM: My job is to help you out? &gt;&gt; ROB: No... &gt;&gt; KIM: You're not a charity case; get a job. &gt;&gt; ROB: The point is, you would rather put yourself in it and take me out of it because you want all the attention. Just like you said, "I want to do Oprah by myself." I get it, you want to separate yourself, be your own person. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, that's not. &gt;&gt; ROB: You can just look at her, take a picture. A picture says 1,000 words. Right there, I would say one word-- "selfish." &gt;&gt; KIM: You sound like a idiot. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, really? I sound like an idiot? Right, I am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, all right, all right. You guys, come on. Just, everyone take a deep breath, because this is crazy. I really don't believe in therapy, but listening to them fight like this, it's probably a really good idea that we're here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm Kim. &gt;&gt; NICKI: I'm Dr. Nicki. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not in the mood for this, and I don't really want to talk to a stranger about my family problem. &gt;&gt; NICKI: So you feel like your mom favors Kim? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think all three of us could say that. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; NICKI: Good. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm Kim. &gt;&gt; NICKI: I'm Dr. Nicki. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Kourtney. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Hi, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Dr. Nicki. It's so good to be with you all. &gt;&gt; ROB: How are you? Robert. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Hey, Robert. &gt;&gt; ROB: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, I'm Kris. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Hi, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Good to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Who's excited about being here? All right, then. &gt;&gt; ROB: She is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I like therapy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney likes therapy; she does it weekly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I hate going to it. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, I like it after. Like, I feel better after, but I'm not like, "Yes, I'm going to therapy." &gt;&gt; NICKI: Like working out, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just not for me. I mean, I've tried it, I get it. Like, I'm a really, like, logical person, so if I'm acting crazy, I know all the reasons why. I feel like after just having this huge fight right before we walk into our therapy, I'm not in the mood for this. And I don't really want to talk to a stranger about my family problem. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've never done therapy before, but Kourtney and my mom have deep-rooted issues. Robert has just a lot of deep-rooted issues. 'Cause Robert doesn't talk to a lot of people. He shares certain things with Kourtney, certain things with Kim and certain things with me. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Is that true, Robert? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, probably. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Not that I'm anti-social, I just choose not to... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, he is anti-social, too. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Hang on, let him talk. &gt;&gt; KIM: He changes his cell phone number once a week. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Hold on, hold on, hold on. &gt;&gt; ROB: Let him talk, let him talk. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Let him talk. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, the only people in my life that matter or that need to contact me are... is my family. I don't have many friends, 'cause I'm about having a very close... close circle. So... &gt;&gt; NICKI: So you're kind of private. &gt;&gt; ROB: Very private. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just think we, as women, I don't think even give him time to talk. So I think it would be good for... &gt;&gt; NICKI: I saw little inklings of that a second ago. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it would be good to actually let him feel like he has the floor, and like, to hear what he has to say. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Before we came in here, him and Kim were violently yelling at each other, so... &gt;&gt; NICKI: Okay, well, we'll let them tell us about that at some point, how about that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We got a big day ahead of us, Mase. You know what we're going to do? We're gonna straight chill. Who do you have more fun with, Mommy or Daddy? &gt;&gt; MASON: Mommy and Daddy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Both of us, okay. What's Mom's name? &gt;&gt; MASON: Mommy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you know her real name? &gt;&gt; MASON: Kourtney. Beep, beep! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hold on! Beep, beep. Whoo! &gt;&gt; MASON: Whoo! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wow, Mase. &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to go in the water. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want to go in the water? How about we go in the water after lunch? I think we go out for lunch... &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...and we have shrimp and rice, and then when we come home, we go in the pool. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay? Give me a hug and a kiss. 708 00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:50,782 L... love you. &gt;&gt; MASON: Love you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: My thing is, to come away with today, would be that we all have a line that we learn not to cross. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Great! &gt;&gt; KRIS: And that we have mutual respect for "this is my mom's role, my mom did that," instead of just taking each other for granted all the time. All families have problems, and it gets really complicated when there's a lot of people growing and evolving and the issues keep getting bigger and crazier. Appreciation, I think, would be really cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In my opinion, appreciation given is given to others... more. Kourtney, Kim and I, we're business partners in every... almost everything that we do. Yes, Kim did a phenomenal job on QVC and we all praised her. But I don't think... like, that praise isn't given to, like, Kourtney or I. &gt;&gt; NICKI: So you feel like your mom favors Kim. Is that what you're saying? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think all three of us could say that. Yes. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Yes? Do you feel like that's true, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that my mom and I have a closer relationship, that I could understand her more, so I think that she's more comfortable like, communicating with me. Like, I think Kourtney and Khloe are closer, so they communicate all the time, and, like, I feel left out all the time. But I'm an adult, so I'm not going to sit and cry over it. I... they're closer, you know? &gt;&gt; NICKI: Well, left out still can hurt, even if you're an adult. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but it doesn't hurt my feelings. They're just closer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think a lot of it you take personally. And I don't mean any harm at all, because I'm totally paying attention to everything that's going on. It took me 17 e-mails to get to, "Oh, great job, Kim." Everyone else was going, "Oh, my God, that was great!" You didn't hear from me because I was just catching up with 3,000 other things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know why my mom finds it such a shock that we think she favors Kim. It's like... it's facts. And to tell your own child that you're just too busy... I'm obviously hurt, because we're not just my mom's clients, we're her children. &gt;&gt; NICKI: What are you feeling in this moment? You look... sad. Am I misreading you? Things don't get better when you walk out. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; NICKI: So you feel like your mom favors Kim? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think it bothers me as much as it bothers Khloe. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, 'cause you don't care for anyone's approval. You don't, like... &gt;&gt; NICKI: Is that true? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean... &gt;&gt; NICKI: You're less interested in approval? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It doesn't affect my... day... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...if she says, "Great job," or not. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And it affects mine. &gt;&gt; NICKI: So, Kris, what do you think about what Khloe's saying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's something I need to work on... is respect, and appreciation, which I'd also like back. The reality is, I run a tight schedule. Once something's in the can, I'll turn around and I'm on to the next thing. So I need to learn how to stop 770 00:38:53,298 --> 00:39:00,338 and tell you guys how proud I am of you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How old are you now, again? &gt;&gt; MASON: Two. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I thought you were two and a half. &gt;&gt; MASON: No, I'm two! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you're only two? Okay. Yeah. &gt;&gt; MASON: Dun, dun, dun. Dun, dun, dun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Which one do you want? &gt;&gt; MASON: Uh... the eagle. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna put it on here. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know what to do. Hit it! All right, so you watch there, Daddy'll get some work done here. Okay? &gt;&gt; MASON: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. Hello? Hey. How's it going? Right now I can't, just 'cause I'm hanging out with my son, and it's like, I have all my hands full. I'm gonna be on e-mail in a little bit, so if you want, just touch base with me with those contracts, and I'll look over them beforehand, so... &gt;&gt; MASON: I don't want that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...at least I'll know what's going on at this meeting. Kourtney doesn't love leaving Mason for a whole day with me, because she gets worried that I'm gonna focus on business and not Mason. Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, man. I already know that when the second child gets here, I'm gonna have even more responsibility. It's not the easiest balance. &gt;&gt; MASON: Daddy, where do we put this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where do we put those? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Um... 801 00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:19,183 Right there. &gt;&gt; MASON: Oh. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; NICKI: So, Robert, everybody talks about you... &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; NICKI: ...and kind of, it seems, for you. Are they right, though, that you're kind of a simmering volcano, waiting to erupt? &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh, if I'm... if it's something I'm passionate about, then I'm going to speak my mind. &gt;&gt; KIM: But with a screaming voice. &gt;&gt; NICKI: With a screaming voice? &gt;&gt; ROB: And it's only if I'm passionate about it, or if I'm speaking the truth about something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You remind me of how I used to be like, and have this anger inside. I think sometimes you don't know what's going to just set you off. &gt;&gt; ROB: My whole thing is, my anger, a lot of it, stems from like the working environment. Because they all kind of... put this cloud on me, like I'm a loser. &gt;&gt; NICKI: What do you say when people do that? &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, I don't say anything, because I don't believe it. &gt;&gt; KIM: But then you blow up later. &gt;&gt; NICKI: No, I know. But then you blow up later. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I blow up later because when there's a business opportunity, all my mom obviously cares about is the three girls, and whenever I say, "Let me... I want to open up a men's store..." &gt;&gt; KIM: But Mom never helped us with that. &gt;&gt; ROB: Anyways, she's my mother, and... &gt;&gt; NICKI: Okay, hang on for a second. Okay, guys, hang on for a second. First of all, what are you feeling in this moment? &gt;&gt; ROB: Like they don't understand, so... &gt;&gt; NICKI: Misunderstood. And how does that feel to you? You look... &gt;&gt; ROB: It's frustrating. &gt;&gt; NICKI: You look... sad. Am I misreading you? I want everybody quiet but Rob, now. Robert, don't leave. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please don't leave, Rob. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Please? Please don't leave. Stay and talk about this. Things don't get better when you walk out. &gt;&gt; NICKI: You look... sad. Am I misreading you? Things don't get better when you walk out. I know. I know. But it's good for him to cry. That's the stuff he was holding in the whole time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I know it's good. He... but he never does, that's why... &gt;&gt; NICKI: Well, that's... that's the value of this kind of a forum. &gt;&gt; KIM: He does... &gt;&gt; NICKI: You know what? I'm going to go see if I can find him for a second, okay? Would you mind? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Are you okay... it's okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's okay, you're allowed to cry. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's, like, no help. I try to do anything... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I could help you. You just have to tell me what you need help with. Who is it? &gt;&gt; NICKI: It's Dr. Nicki. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Dr. Nicki. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Hi. I know this is really hard. You don't feel safe. Aw. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We always joke around that Rob has all this built-up anger, and that he could erupt at any time. But I really had no idea it was gonna go this deep, and this far, and be this emotional. Next on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians... I don't think any of us know what we're doing. With our career, I think Mom and I just were lucky and we, like, made it happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was trying to doing therapy thinking it would, like, make everyone happy, but it backfired. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is really stupid. They're just being blatantly 872 00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:43,955 rude and not responding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You e-mailed them. Maybe they take offense to that.
