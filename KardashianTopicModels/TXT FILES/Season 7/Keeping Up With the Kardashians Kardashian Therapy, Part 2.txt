- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... We do everything together. I would love something on my own. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim wanting to branch out and do things on her own? That's insulting to me. &gt;&gt; ROB: I've always wanted to open up, uh, a men's Dash store. And I feel like my mom doesn't take me seriously. I told you this for years. Kim is selfish obviously, doesn't ever want to include me in anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: My job is to help you out? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're not a charity case. Get a job. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like we have a lot to say. We need a group family therapy session. &gt;&gt; ROB: When there's a business opportunity, all they care about is the three girls. &gt;&gt; NICKI: You look sad. Am I misreading you? 18 00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:46,246 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really had no idea it was going to go this deep. &gt;&gt; NICKI: What's going through your mind? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you just need to cry? &gt;&gt; NICKI: I understand that. What do you think-- what would you like to have happen? &gt;&gt; ROB: All I care about is, like, saying yes to my mom, making her happy, doing whatever my sisters want to make them 26 00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:23,183 happy, and I feel like, when it comes to the easiest thing, they don't... &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I feel bad for him for sure, but I also think he might need to, like, take responsibility, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, obviously. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just think-- I like it when he gets vulnerable because I feel like he needs to break those walls down. He's so angry. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm frustrated that, uh, I want to, um, just do certain things, like, in a business sense and I feel like my dad, like, would have understood me. &gt;&gt; NICKI: I just don't think this is the issue. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's so much more. &gt;&gt; NICKI: This is the, this is the sup-- you know, this is the top-layer issue. You've been running from all of these feelings. You feel like, um, one of those steam kettles sitting on the, on the stove with the fire on, just full of feelings. You've been running from yourself from my point of view, Robert. You've been running from all of these feelings. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to sit back down? 46 00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:24,845 &gt;&gt; NICKI: I got you. It's okay. Let me see your face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Rob, you okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you miss us? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We did miss you. &gt;&gt; NICKI: The context of connection and communication, which is really this, is you have permission to deal with your feelings. What I'm looking at is, what are the underlying issues? Clearly these feelings are coming through because of your relationship to all of these women. In a family like this that's so intensely related to each other, it's challenging, you know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's challenging. I think I'm the happiest when they're happy. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And lately I feel like Kim's been in a really good place, Kourtney is excited about her baby, Khloe's been really happy to be back in L.A., and then that one... : Now I'm gonna cry. It's just... &gt;&gt; NICKI: It's okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He is not in a very good mood hardly ever, so it makes me really sad because there's something there that is just sad all the time. It's like a little knife, like every single day, just digging because he's the one who seems lost, and I feel like I can't do anything about it. I think that grief just doesn't go away. Robert feels like these are big decisions he needs to make in his life and maybe he's not getting what he needs from all of us, and he might have gotten it from his dad, you know, and he's not here and I'm sure that that's painful. &gt;&gt; NICKI: You know, he's so worried about making you happy, Kris, he is. He's so worried. He's worried about making everybody else happy. He doesn't want to let the family down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not going to let us down, Robert, if you follow your heart. &gt;&gt; ROB: It just frustrates me that, like, we're supposed to be a family and a team, and when there's an opportunity to be in the mix or even to do something... &gt;&gt; KIM: You say you want something. Well, no one ever gave me anything. Like, I worked. I wanted something, I made it happen. Kourtney wants something, she makes it happen. Khloe wants something, she makes it happen. Rob, you're cut from the same cloth... &gt;&gt; ROB: The majority of the time together, you three girls. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, a lot of the things are, like, that we do together are our makeup line and our nail polish, and that stuff isn't appropriate for you. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, and I get it and I say that, but you have not... &gt;&gt; KIM: But we would do anything for you and we've asked you so many times. &gt;&gt; ROB: But I've said this so much, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think we all get, like, caught up, though, in our stuff that's going on in our own lives and that... &gt;&gt; ROB: Which is fine, you're busy, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: I've always been, like, the type-- like, just hustle and do it on your own, so I feel like sometimes when you want help, I'm like, "You're not directing us," and I told Mom this is exactly what I want to do, so she made it happen. So I think we would all help you if you had a little bit more guidance to us. If you really think about it, it could be so intimidating to have three sisters that are m-- you know, successful and then being, like, the one boy. It must be hard being around us. I completely understand it, but there's something that I just don't get-- why it doesn't motivate him, though. My mom isn't a typical manager and that's where she needs to divide her time a little bit better. She is doing the best she can and I feel bad for her that, like, all of us are really mean to her when, like, it's not her fault. : And that's why I always have her back-- 'cause I don't think it's her fault. I think she just doesn't know how to raise, like, a son that well. That was, like, Dad's thing, and now that Dad's not here it's, like, no one's fault, you know, so, like, I don't think any of us know what we're doing. With our career, I think Mom and I just were lucky and we, like, made it happen. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wouldn't know what to do with, like... I know what to do with me, and then I'm like, "Girls, come along." Some things, I don't even know what I'm doing, and it's just, we all do it, but I feel bad that, like, everyone, like, is so mean to Mom 'cause I just... She does what she can with the girls. That's her thing-- girls, you know. It's, like, hard to explain, but it's, like, how I feel. &gt;&gt; NICKI: No, you're, you're explaining it very well. Kim, how old were you when Dad died? &gt;&gt; KIM: 22. &gt;&gt; NICKI: You were 22? And how was that last time for you? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like, when someone's sick, you just do what you got to do and take care of them, and I think I handled it really well. I spoke at his funeral. I don't think any of them would have been able to. I was pretty together. I worked in his office. I was, like, the last one working at his office at that point. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was working there, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: At the time he died, I think it was just me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was there, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I don't remember, but I don't... Because I would always leave to bring him lunch, so I really don't remember that. I think the last six months... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you taking away something that I...? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't remember it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I'll go with your story. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not taking it away. I just don't remember you working there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're very good at that, by the way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If Kim doesn't remember things the way I remember it, Kim will call me a liar. She does it to me all the time. You're not right all the time. &gt;&gt; KIM: You and I never worked together at the same time. We had the same position. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never said I worked with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I was... It doesn't matter, the fact doesn't matter, but... &gt;&gt; NICKI: Why is this important here? &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause she just lies about every-- like, little things all the time to, like, I think, to invalidate other people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So it's me who's fabricating the story? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm trying to sit there and be supportive and listen to everyone's issues, but I'm just feeling so attacked. I just would rather get out of the situation and not be here. I mean, I don't even care. &gt;&gt; NICKI: But you do care. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not really. &gt;&gt; NICKI: Really? 'Cause it feels like you care. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just annoyed because I've been sitting here for a long time and I have somewhere else to go now, so I'm just annoyed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my gosh, the attitude. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're shutting them out. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're just being blatantly rude and not responding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go make it okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is really stupid. I've tried. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You sent an e-mail. They take offense to that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, I'm sorry if I invalidate you. The e-mail is not sincere in my opinion. I was trying to do therapy, thinking it would make everyone happy. It backfired. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ANN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi. &gt;&gt; ANN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How are you? &gt;&gt; ANN: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So, my mom got Kylie and I this wonderful opportunity to be west coast contributors Seventeen Magazine. We are in New York and I'm so excited. Not everyone gets to do this. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Are you excited to Seventeen? &gt;&gt; BOTH: Yes. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think we're both so excited. it's Kendall and Kylie Jenner and we are going to answer some questions for you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye. &gt;&gt; MAN: See ya, thanks. &gt;&gt; MICKI: After you. So, June 5 is still the end of school? &gt;&gt; COCO: So, I want you to just look at the mirror and you're just gonna play with your facial expressions. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's really fun and I would never not want to do it, but it's just so hard when you miss school, even though it's only a few days. It's like, it's a crucial few days. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What a long day. 201 00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:45,652 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. I'm so tired. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm exhausted. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My sisters and I quickly have to change because we have an appearance Jimmy Kimmel Live, which is awkward coming out of this very emotional therapy session. Kim is being quiet, distant and just different. Not that I really care if she speaks right now 'cause she said some really unforgivable 210 00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:23,556 things in therapy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so, um... ...and then just cut it off. Oh my God. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You would tear it. You know, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: Shall we? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We shall. &gt;&gt; MAN: Good luck, girls. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Good luck. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's do more than good. It's amazing. &gt;&gt; MAN: Come on, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Look at Brandon. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is Leah in it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? You're watching videos? You should be doing your homework instead of goofing off. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We just went to New York for three days and missed so much school, and we don't have any of our stuff, so we're waiting for our friends to email our stuff to us. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: One reason why we should be homeschooled. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall and Kylie have been asking me to be homeschooled for months. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's so hard to keep up. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We miss 'cause we're working. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I sit there in class and I don't know anything and it makes me feel so dumb. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What can we do to help you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Homeschooling or something. So I can be at my own level. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm against it because I don't want them to miss out on that high school experience. Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We miss so much school and, like, to get our work done, that's not easy. Kylie and I usually work together a lot, whether it's photo shoots or interviews and I'm so thankful for it and I love doing it, but it is kind of hard to keep up with school work. &gt;&gt; STYLIST: Here look up a little bit. If you want me to finish it, you got to look up. Okay, I love you, but I don't want to be here all day. You're gonna put this down so I can finish. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It does make a lot of sense for us to both do homeschooling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do your home work and then you won't feel like you're so far behind. And you should be studying while you're on the road. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We were away. What are we supposed to do? We're trying to get all our stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, you have to learn how to multitask. When I'm away, I don't let my work slough off. Do I? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Sick, Mom, sick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And please pick the gum off of the top of the water bottle, and throw it away. That's not right. Where are your manners? Okay? And absolutely no homeschooling, girls. Come on, chop, chop. Turn that off, Kendall, and get to your homework. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Choppy day. I have total nipple action. I told Lamar about our therapy session. &gt;&gt; ROB: Figured you did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; ROB: Because he texted me and said, "Is everything okay" or something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you ever reply to Kim and her email? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim sent my mom, Kourt, Rob and I an apology email for therapy. "Rob, I'm sorry if we haven't helped you enough. "Khloe, you're right. Make it more about family than "business because that's all we have, so Robby, let's all sit "down and talk about what's your next move and we will pitch in. "Khloe, I am sorry if I invalidate you and your memories." You know, the email is just not very sincere, in my opinion. So, she kind of just, I feel, like doesn't want to deal with this anymore and just wants to move on. I never responded. &gt;&gt; ROB: I never responded either. She obviously felt really guilty, which is why she emailed us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; ROB: If you were really like saying something from the heart, you would say it to them personally and not give a about what everyone else thinks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. We were getting along really well for a minute. It's sad that it can't last long. &gt;&gt; ROB: Huh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because I was trying to do therapy thinking it would make everyone happy, but I feel 289 00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:25,064 like it kind of backfired. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Either this mirror is very unflattering or I look like a cow with udders. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just making a little soup... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are? I brought my lunch inside. &gt;&gt; KIM: Chicken soup for my soul. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, Kourtney's, you know, just waiting for baby. She's getting a little anxious. &gt;&gt; KIM: Speaking of Kourt, she hasn't even responded to my emails. No one has, actually. So, I send out my email and nobody responds. That's really not like anyone. I think it's just so rude. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe they feel like, you know, you're shutting them out. &gt;&gt; KIM: How would I ever shut them out? We do everything together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. I think... &gt;&gt; KIM: That's my point. I just want to do a couple things by myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I understand exactly where you're coming from and I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but there's been so many stories where people start off as a group and then when one person decides to go off on their own, they might see that as a sign of the beginning of the end. Do you know what I mean? They might feel very threatened by your... &gt;&gt; KIM: But I've reassured them that it's not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that right now, your sisters need a little more conversation. So, you need to go make it okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not the one that's holding a grudge... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You emailed them! Maybe they take offense to that. These are things that you discuss in person, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is really stupid. I've tried. They're just being blatantly rude and not responding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, little Miss Stubborn. Good luck with that if you're not going to reach back out. &gt;&gt; MAN: Mrs. Jenner, uh, may I call you Kris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are you calling from? Kendall and Kylie went behind my back. Your friend Mel called me. You can't do things like that. Sometimes your parents know best. &gt;&gt; KIM: We went to therapy so we would learn about each other. I took the time. 332 00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:14,207 I wrote you guys and the fact that no one responded was kind of rude of all of you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall, why don't you put your plate out here? Plate. Plate. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Plate. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, could we have dinner without that thing on your face? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, the wool up against your face will give you pimples. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ooh, Kylie. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How's everything been at school? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Fantastic. Psych. Me and Kylie are already checked out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know you're very busy, but have you had a chance to talk to anybody about homeschooling? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I haven't. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um, do you want me to fail this school year? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I don't want you to fail at anything in your life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You had a "B" average last semester. You can at least... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's last semester. It's not as hard as the second semester. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can hold on. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Even like, my self esteem when I get a "C" on a test and all my friends got "A"s and I was like in the worst mood. It's like killing me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just feel like you guys aren't making the same effort that you made last semester. You've kind of, like, mentally checked out, and I don't think you're trying anymore, and you're trying to push me into a corner so that I say... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm not trying to do anything! We'll just not get good grades on our report card. Whatever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you're going to show yourself? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, I'm not doing this on purpose! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So maybe we've got to prioritize more. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's they're working 24 hours a day. Kendall and Kylie have such amazing work ethic, but that doesn't mean that school can suffer. School comes first, and everything else comes second right now. If you don't keep your grades up, I'm going to cancel every job that's on the books. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: After talking to my mom, I realized that maybe I should be mature. No matter what happens in life, family always comes first. So, we went to therapy so that we would learn about each other. That was so heavy on my mind, and I took the time, I wrote you guys this e-mail, but, like, the fact that no one responded, that just really hurt my feelings, because I thought it was kind of rude of all of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I didn't respond to you for a specific reason. I just thought your apology was insincere. &gt;&gt; ROB: I literally didn't respond because I'm not gonna just write something if I don't mean it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Leaving there, it made me just want to really, like, understand you and help you and be on the same page as you. When I wrote that, like, we all should have, like, a meeting and figure out stuff together when, like, me and Kourtney and Khloe have these big meetings with Mom, you should sit there and see what we do to get, like, inspired and motivated and then be involved in whatever projects you can be involved in. I apologize for, you know, being rude and just, like, for, just kind of just being a bitch. So... that's pretty much what the e-mail said. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And she's sorry for calling me a liar, and that we all have our own... uh, experiences. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what it is? much younger than us, like five years younger than Kourt, I think sometimes you overhear Kourtney and I talking... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And think they're my stories? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and you think they're your experiences, and you get so offended if they didn't really happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like how you fell into the alligator cage? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, that never happened, and Kourtney and I were joking about that, FYI. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Who takes bites of every plum? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm serious. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Somebody took a bite... &gt;&gt; KIM: Out of every single plum. Is this out here for a joke? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well... &gt;&gt; KIM: Are they, like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: This looks like Kylie's lipstick. She's not a very good thief, because she leaves clues that she's been here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wanted to talk to you about Roberto. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was thinking, what if you called... like, Bruno... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and have him do his own clothing line, like a men's version, and he can come along with us, we can do Kardashian Collection Men. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, I like that. I love that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel bad that Rob has been hurting, and I want him to feel like he has all of the support in the world that he needs. Now, if we have a clothing line, maybe he should have a men's line. You know, there's, like, so much opportunity out there for him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He loves fashion. He loves designing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, he has to know, though, that it's gonna be appearances and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a lot of work. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I think it's worth, like, you know, calling Bruno and making that... setting up a meeting for him, you know? That would be amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a really good idea. 430 00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,720 &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good looking out. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; MEL: Uh, Mrs. Jenner? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes? &gt;&gt; MEL: Hi. This is Mel Cohen with Atlanta Country Day School. Uh, may I call you Kris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sure. &gt;&gt; MEL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are you calling from? &gt;&gt; MEL: Atlanta Country Day School. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; MEL: Uh, your daughters Kylie and Kendall have learned about our educational programs, and I understand that you all are looking for some additional information about us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, well, apparently Kendall and Kylie were. &gt;&gt; MEL: Apparently so. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, I will get back to you very soon. &gt;&gt; MEL: Very good. Thanks. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Bye-bye. I can't believe Kendall and Kylie went behind my back and reached out to this school, called this gentleman, and now has him calling me. Do you guys have anything to tell me? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Any calls you were expecting that I need to know about? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nope. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your friend Mel called me today from the Atlanta Country Day School. He thinks that you girls are going to be homeschooled. You put me in a really awkward position. You can't do things like that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But if you're seriously not gonna listen to us and you're just gonna completely ignore everything we say... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes your parents know best, you got it? Stick your nose in the book and try a little bit harder and you'll be okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've been studying for this exam and don't even have a chance at passing, and you don't even care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I care, Kendall! That's why I love you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar and I are going to go to Queens tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to go to Queens. There's this whole side of Lamar that I don't feel like I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We can, like, turn you into Bouge-ghetto. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it's Bouge-etto. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you got dressed up for our fashion meeting. Rob in a sweatsuit was very 470 00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:44,563 disappointing. You got to take it serious... You just don't care. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know if this is, like, a flattering outfit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, that's a great skirt. It kind of looks like it's your vagina and it's hair growing out right there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, Lamar and I are in New York, all for work, and I'm just excited that I have some quality time with Khloe-mar. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are we thirsty or are we thirsty? This is my pet peeve of life. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Would you like to see the wine list or care for a cocktail? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, I'll have a glass of champagne. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Champagne. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll just have water. Is it possible to remove all the other glasses we don't need? &gt;&gt; WAITER: All the other glasses, absolutely. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. I think Lamar and I are gonna go to Queens tomorrow... &gt;&gt; KIM: You are? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So we could... &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to go to Queens. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You could come. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want Khloe to know just because I want to creatively branch off, doesn't mean that I want to branch off from my family, so, I've never been to where Lamar's from. I would love to see how he was raised and have Khloe bring me on this journey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just so you know, you can't, I mean, like, you be you, like do whatever, but like you can't wear this outfit. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, just take my bracelets and my earrings off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're not gonna jack you. No one's gonna jack you. Just be, like a little more Kimmy from the block rather than, like, Kimmy from... &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know what that means. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm really excited for Kim to come with us to Queens, but she is a glamour puss to the hundredth degree. You can't wear your, like, highest stilettos and walk down Jamaica Ave. Like, just be, like, more low-key. Like, you have jeans. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know if I brought it with me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, right. You brought jeans. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, seriously. When I go to New York, I only bring, like, ultra-fab outfits. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, just be in an 513 00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:52,992 ultra-fab casual outfit. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'll try. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, look at all the paparazzi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, you guys! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, you guys! &gt;&gt; KIM: They're sticking their middle fingers out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, here's the deal, Queens. &gt;&gt; KIM: Since I feel like I've never been to Queens, and that's a problem for me. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Y'all need to come anyway to see, like, to see those boy roots. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been to... I have been to Queens. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: To see my roots. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I feel like I know you, but I don't know... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Where I come from. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...where you come from. I have dreams about your family, I have, like... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Mm-hmm. You need to really see it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You would probably understand me a little bit more. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I've been really close with Lamar, but there's also, like, this whole side of Lamar that I don't feel like I know. Even though he tells these stories, I just feel like I could know a little bit more, and I'm intrigued and I want to know. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You should really see Jamaica Avenue, where I took her. It's the hood Rodeo drive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We could like turn you into Bouge-ghetto. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it's Bouge-etto. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Like, it fit all the, it fit, it fit all the Queens stereotypes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone tells me, "You're so much skinnier than I thought," and I'm, like, "Oh, 541 00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:08,801 thanks," and I just, I'm like I want to stay here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Morning. mi madre? &gt;&gt; SECRETARY: Uh, should be in route, coming in. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott and I have a meeting today with Bruno. He helped my sisters launch their clothing line, and he's gonna help Scott and I. And I really wanted Scott involved because, you know, he's successful. And like he's a business man. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you got dressed up for our fashion meeting. &gt;&gt; ROB: I know. I don't feel good. No, I really don't this time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I would do anything I could to help Rob out in a business sense, but to see Rob come to the meeting unshowered in a sweatsuit was very disappointing. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean... No. It's Bru... It's, like, not like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You can't cry about that you don't have more responsibilities, and then you get the opportunity, and then, you pass it up by not trying. I'm nervous that these people are gonna walk out of this meeting because that's not the image that they were looking to sell. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Hello, hello, hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar! You got to see Kim in this outfit. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lamar, I'm coming up. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo, what the is that, yo? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get the hell out of bed, Kylie. This isn't funny. I obviously know that Kylie's not really that sick. She probably didn't study well enough for a test. 569 00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:33,919 She doesn't want to fail. If you're not down there in five minutes, you're grounded. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Hello, hello, hello. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUNO: How are you? Good, good. &gt;&gt; ROB: Robert. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Hi, Robert. How are you? He's looking as dapper as ever. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks. Good to see you. &gt;&gt; ROB: And excuse my attire. No, I'm not feeling too well. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Is this the kind of look we're going for? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I said. &gt;&gt; ROB: I said I'm not feeling well. I just literally... &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. Oh, no. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Sweatpants, right? So that's gonna be your signature style, sweatpants. &gt;&gt; ROB: Sweat. Yeah, that's... &gt;&gt; PETER: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so sorry I'm late. &gt;&gt; PETER: How are you? Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; PETER: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUNO: I was complimenting Rob on his attire. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is this a joke? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm trying to make a statement to let them know you can be comfortable in anything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, everybody thinks it's so funny that Rob didn't get dressed, and he's in a sweatsuit. It was not simple to get a big meeting set up that could be a big future for us, and you got to shower, get dressed, look presentable. Come in with a great open attitude. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Let's go with Rob since you're standing right beside me here, right? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: And you're wearing sweats... for our meeting. &gt;&gt; ROB:Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But he has good style when he wants to, he just chooses... sweats a lot. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: You do. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: You know, you're whole casual is youthful, straight and fun, so, that's how I would see it, right? &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: So, every time I've seen you, you've kind of, like, always thrown something on, something quick, but look how great that looks, right? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, yeah. I'd really like for a casual wear, like, some nice pants with, like... uh, button ups but all the way to the top, and then with, like, a cardigan or some cool jacket over it. Um, I always throw on a hat. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Always the cap, all right. &gt;&gt; ROB: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: So, this is you, Scott. We see you as kind of the sophisticated, uh, the Hamptons. That's a look that, uh, we would go for. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I like things that are kind of retro, but things that are from more of the '70s era. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: How would you feel about a collection that both of you are in it? Because more of a casual... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, I can focus on formal, he can focus on casual. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Correct. &gt;&gt; ROB: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And then it's a little for everybody. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Have you thought of a name? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He thought of a name. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I-I originally said "Robert Scott." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like that. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: I like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob really wants to drive this himself. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Yeah. Awesome. Love it. I want you to give the input just like your sisters do. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Like your sisters are at every meeting, they do the fittings. It's 100%. You want to be... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, no. We want to be 100% involved. I'm obviously all about my business right now, and I'm dedicated and focused, so I want to keep it going and show Scott and my mom that I am dedicated. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: All right, guys. Thank you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Cool. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. I'm excited. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm leaving right now and Kylie is still sleeping. She won't get out of bed. She says she doesn't feel good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She says she doesn't feel good? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I have finals. I have to leave. I'm not waiting for her to get up and get ready. I have to leave. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, can't you wait just a few minutes? Let me... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, I have to be at school right now, Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Well, I have to go to the gym and Gunnar's gonna kill me if I'm late. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, I don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna just kill Kylie. Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? What do you mean you don't feel good? Guess who now has to take you to school because you didn't get up on time? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, I don't feel good. I'm not into it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's finals. Get the hell out of bed, Kylie! This isn't funny. You're gonna make me late, and now you made Kendall late because you feel like you didn't study? I obviously know that Kylie's not really that sick. She probably didn't study well enough for a test. She doesn't want to fail because she actually does care, but you know what? Don't kid a kidder. Kylie, I'm gonna be waiting downstairs, and if you're not down there in five minutes, you're grounded. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Y'all want to go up on the block? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is Lamar's day, so he's going to take Khloe and I all around Queens. Is that me on the cover of that mix tape? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I sit there in class and I don't know anything. 669 00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:38,463 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't think that you are trying hard enough. Kylie, what are you...? Kylie! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Please, Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: You first. Jonathan is like the ultimate New Yorker, so I think he's the perfect friend to help me pick out what I'm gonna wear to Queens. What about these pants? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is perfect for you. This is good, too. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yeah. Oh, wait, look. It says, "I love cock." &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, wait. This could be Queens. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We're about to get into Staten Island, so we need to stop at Queens right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What about this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is real good. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN:You definitely need a hat. &gt;&gt; KIM: You think? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Put it on as an outfit. Yeah, it's good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Do I need a backpack? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, we're not going to a rave. We're going to Queens. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you carry it? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: See you on the Queens borough. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Lamar, you've got to see Kim in this outfit. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lamar, I'm coming up. You like my outfit for Queens? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo, what the is that, yo? You totally got the wrong idea about Queens, girlfriend. In Living Jennifer Lopez-type look, and it's just like it's, it's not working. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I can't wear this to to Queens? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Nah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I look like a clown. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Nah... &gt;&gt; KIM: How much are you gonna put that on? That's, like, not healthy. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, I do my right. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, seriously, that's 705 00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:20,499 why you have pimples all over your face. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, I hate to bitch at you, but you have to be more respectful of other people's time. You had a ride to school a half an hour ago, and now I have to go to the same place that Kendall just went to because you decided you weren't ready to take a test. Life doesn't work that way. If I decide that I'm not ready to have a business meeting, I still have to have the business meeting. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, I sit there in class and I don't know anything. We've been telling you that for months. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just think you don't have any confidence in yourself. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We miss so much school, Mom, and no one gets it. Like, it's frustrating, when I get, like, a D on a test and my teachers say, "You can do better." 722 00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:14,786 Like, I can't do better. Every time I get a test back, I, like, get teary-eyed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't think that you are trying hard enough. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm done with my mom just not listening and not hearing the real reasons. It's frustrating when you're doing bad and you can't do anything about it, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, what are you... Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You don't listen, Mom. I'm over it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, you get back 731 00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:37,909 in... Kylie, what are you doing? Where are you going, Kylie? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie. Kylie. Kylie, get in the car, Kylie. Come on, get in the car. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I'm not going to school, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to go to school. Kylie. Kylie, if you're this upset, honey, just get in the car. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's not fun to fail, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, please, come on. Get in the car. I promise you that we'll go home right now and I'll sit and talk to you and I'll listen. All right. I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were that mad and that upset about this. I mean, I don't want you to go to school feeling like a failure. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall gets rashes all over her body. I get anxiety attacks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Kylie. I didn't realize what was going on inside. I thought you were just trying to avoid the fact that you felt like you didn't study enough. If we can take a meeting with this homeschool company, I'm willing to give it a try. It's such a confusing position to be in. I want to be a good mom and I want to be responsible and do right by my kids, but I know that we don't live the typical, normal life that most kids live. Most children their age don't have full-time jobs, so I need to find the balance. I love you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Say it like you mean it. 759 00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:26,117 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Better. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I tweeted "Queens, baby," and someone said, "Are you going to the Katz Bar?" And then someone else said, "What about Brooklyn?" People in New York take their boroughs so seriously. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Restroom in there? Yeah, they got restrooms in there. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi, Khloe! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hi, baby. Me, Kim and Khloe, we here at my old stomping grounds on 165th Street and Jamaica Avenue, um, doing a little shopping. This is where I come get all my mix tapes. All my good music. Oh, hey. How you doing? &gt;&gt; CIARA: I'm good. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; CIARA: How is it? Thank you. That Meek Mill "Street Is Watching Two," that's new or old? That's old? Kanye, you got Kanye? Let me get that Pusha T one too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this your favorite thing to do, to come and pick out CDs? This is Lamar's day, so he's gonna take Khloe and I all around Queens wherever his spots are that he would always go to. So, our first stop is this CD store and it is so cool. They have all these mix tapes and mix CDs. Uh, is that me on the cover of that mix tape? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Where? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait... &gt;&gt; CLERK: You want to see it? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mix tapes aren't like a valid thing... &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, Kanye's on there too. Wow, funny. Can we just get it just... I was like, "Wait." LAMAR: Know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom would like that Luther Vandross mix tape. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: She would. ♫ ♫ What's up? We had a lot of fun. This is like the first place where I started to buy jewelry, so I'm kind of like flashing back to, you know, to when I'm 16, 17 years old and I have Khloe and Kim here with me right now. It seems like, uh, it's a little surreal. Y'all want to go up on the block? &gt;&gt; KIM: This definitely shows me a different side of Lamar. He talks about Queens all the time. So, now, in the future, every time he talks about Queens, I'll know what he's talking about. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: After school in the afternoon was like the hangout for everybody. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, like Century City, in the mall, in L.A. was like our hangout after school, you know? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. 806 00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:09,047 &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh my God, I love it here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? [Bleep] me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I guess Kris Humphries is serving Kanye West for a subpoena. He subpoenaed him today for a deposition. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: On what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is he gonna subpoena me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Jesus. Hello. &gt;&gt; MEL and JANE: Hello! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bruce. &gt;&gt; MEL: Bruce, I'm Mel Cohen. This is Jane. &gt;&gt; JANE: I'm Jane. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I'm Kris. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; JANE: How are you? Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Today we're meeting with the Atlanta Country Day School people so Bruce and I can see what it is that they do. And if it's the right decision for my children. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Homeschooling! &gt;&gt; JANE: Homeschooling. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now we start with your background first. &gt;&gt; MEL: Here. &gt;&gt; JANE: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; MEL: We're with, of course, the Atlanta Country Day School. We're fully accredited and we work with students in grades 7 through 12. It's a legitimate college preparatory curriculum and then for about the past 25, 30 years we have been doing celebrity students... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ah. &gt;&gt; MEL: ...who because of what they do and they've reached a point in that specialty, they can't attend school on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; MEL: You will be instructed just as if you were sitting in a classroom of 20 or 30. You're gonna get actually better quality instruction because it's gonna be a class of one. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MEL: We know you have tremendous demands on your time, so we have to do this in the most efficient way possible. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, if the girls had to go to Japan, you would have somebody that could go to Japan. &gt;&gt; MEL: Would go... would go with them. &gt;&gt; JANE: This teacher 24-7 would be at their disposal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's the right thing for them and this is one that I think is going to work really well for Kendall and Kylie. &gt;&gt; JANE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so impressed. I really had no idea it can work this way. I feel bad that it's taken me this long to come around. The girls are gonna be in really good hands and I think we made the right decision. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'll see you guys soon. Bye. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Even though it did take my mom a while, she finally listened. Homeschool is going to happen. I can have time for both work and school and I'm excited for that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Nice meeting you. &gt;&gt; JANE: Bye, sweetie. &gt;&gt; MEL: Bye bye. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye. 859 00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:40,398 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Her bra's hanging out. &gt;&gt; JANE: ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; LAMAR: How you doing, man? &gt;&gt; MAN: How you doing, Lamar? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's up? &gt;&gt; MAN: What's up, man? You gonna learn something today, boy. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. Georgia Tech, homey. You're going to Georgia Tech? Huh? What up, dawg? &gt;&gt; MAN: You are the Kardashian ladies? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm now an Odom lady. &gt;&gt; MAN: This is the one... this is the lady you married? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, I knocked her... &gt;&gt; MAN: Let me talk to you for a minute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are we gonna talk about? &gt;&gt; MAN: Nothing, I'm just playing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna tell on him? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Lincoln Park was the court, the first court that I ruled, that I couldn't get taken off of. This is where I learned the rules of engagement as far as the streets are concerned. How to be taken seriously. &gt;&gt; KIM: How do you know those people? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I grew up with them. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh yeah! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I rolled with them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Pass. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I know all them in the neighborhood since I was like... since eight. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: See how when I came in, all those people grew up, you know what I'm saying, with my moms, my aunt and all that, and that's where they used to hustle at right there, that's where all the drugs were sold. The park used to be the stash house. When my moms died, I had came to the park and I slept in here for like two or three days. I mean, the whole neighborhood would basically look out for me... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Watch after you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Because I mean, my family been in this neighborhood since 1957. &gt;&gt; KIM: You want to play a game of one on one? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Play horse. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I'm thankful I had Khloe bring me on this journey. This has definitely brought Lamar and I a lot closer as like brother and sister and as a family we're still growing together and we'll always do that. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Now you understand the hood. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We like it over here. Next on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a little nervous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How many children could fit in this house? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? Don't you think I should have some kind of say in this? &gt;&gt; ROB: He thinks he's just your babymaker to have sex with you twice a year. &gt;&gt; KIM: You've been trying to have a baby for like years. And you haven't gotten pregnant. 909 00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:44,055 &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You may not have ovulated.
