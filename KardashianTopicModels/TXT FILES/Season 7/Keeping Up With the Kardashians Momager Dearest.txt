- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Previously on Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know all the rumors about Khloe's paternity are ridiculous. Why wouldn't we just do a DNA test? Once and for all we'd have an answer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because I don't need an answer. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? Even though Khloe puts on a brave face, I know that this is something she really needs. Khloe has been tortured because she doesn't really know who her real dad is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't understand why we're doing it behind her back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourt, say yes for the test. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's no reason she needs to not know about this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I knew that Kourtney would be the most difficult through this whole process, but this time she really needs to come through for me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm on Team Khloe, so whatever Khloe is comfortable 20 00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:42,737 with... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you be on Team Mom for once in your life? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. Will you guys help me jump on the bed and see if it'll soften up, for real? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, you, like, can't even jump on it. It's like a rock. &gt;&gt; KIM: Especially here it's 27 00:00:57,216 --> 00:01:04,556 like... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm getting a workout. &gt;&gt; KIM: This past year Kendall and Kylie and I have gotten closer, and I just love hanging out with my sisters and just bonding more with them. Ooh, look at this, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, that's really pretty. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What is this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you guys ever put on fake lashes before? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Not myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Neither have I. Oh, my God, I just put on a fake lash. Okay, will you help me do the other eye? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There, open. Open, open. &gt;&gt; KIM: I swear, Kylie, you, like, glued my eye together. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're kidding. &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot... I swear. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Say "Bible." &gt;&gt; KIM: Bible. Aah! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. You do such weird things. You're so weird. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hi, Grandma. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so excited you're here. I miss you so much, Mase. Why are you wearing a pink shirt and pink sunglasses? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause he's-- real men wear pink. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The pink shirt's cute. It's like a little much for me with the pink sunglasses. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You always say something about Mason. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He looks like this, he looks like that. I get so annoyed at myself for acting the same way to Scott sometimes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is it a bad thing to look like your mother or have mannerisms like your mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm just saying, I happened to get the bitchy and annoying ones. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks. Kourtney has always been the toughest critic on me, and ever since I wrote my book, it seems to be bringing up a lot of emotions for everybody involved. Maybe she's got to check those hormones. Yeah, I went to the Babyface concert the other night. You know who I saw there that was crazy hot? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who? &gt;&gt; KRIS: One of the contestants The Voice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you bone him there in the bathroom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did I what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not like it would be such a shock. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have been married for 21 years. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like that stopped you before. I'm just saying. My mom's just, like, talking about some hot guy at the concert, and I just find every little thing she's saying annoying. Like, she's a married woman. 73 00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:43,492 It's just inappropriate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes you can be really rude. Okay. Take this. Ooh. Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guess what I have. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are an official Kendall Jenner West Coast Fashion Contributor. Isn't that awesome? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. My mom got Kylie and I this wonderful opportunity to be West Seventeen magazine, and I'm so excited. This is just the biggest blessing. Not everyone gets to do this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, Ky. Kylie. What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You don't even have it attached to something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It works. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're using it for looks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am not. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You would be the one... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. She just disconnected me. Those are yours, and today's the day that you guys are going to go out and do an assignment for them. They want you to go into Malibu, approach people to see if you can find 20 young models who would be perfect picks for the magazine, which means you're going to have to go up to people and actually say, "Hi, I'm Kylie." "I'm Kendall." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? We have to walk up to complete strangers? That's going to be so awkward. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's why it's important for you to use your little social skills. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's not awkward. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It is awkward for me. Although this is such a wonderful opportunity and I don't want to take anything for granted, I'm just such a shy person, I don't know if I can just walk up to random people. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The minute you say, "Have you ever thought about magazine," I promise you any teenage girl would swoon. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Swoon? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Swoon. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You got it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I have my phone back, please? Ha, ha, give me the phone. : Give me the phone. Give me the phone. You're gonna fall. Give me the phone, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Give me the phone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. All right. Well, get out of here in the 117 00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:40,527 next ten minutes or you're going to be late, and have fun. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Hello, ladies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think we're ready to order. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll get the cream of broccoli and an ice tea, please. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can I have an Arnold Palmer and then half of the chicken special sandwich and chips and dip? &gt;&gt; WAITER: You got it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: So what's going on with Dash? Like, where do we stand with that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The landlord said he would put it into, like, a perfect shell for us. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He was going to see if he would lower the rent, too, and include the parking spaces for free. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom wants to go look at the Dash space. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want her to come. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't need her opinion. She's just, like, annoying me lately. It's just the way she handled, like, the Khloe situation. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think you've always had these issues with Mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I feel like then it was fine and then she had to, like, bring this all up again. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think my mom writing this book and being so candid has just brought up these feelings that, I think, Kourtney thought weren't necessary. Kourtney and I were the only ones old enough to really understand what was going on. Kourtney just took it the hardest. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Remember how you're the one who told me why they divorced? I didn't know Mom cheated on Dad until you were like, "You still like your mom?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was very cheerful. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney can never understand now, having her own child, what it would be like to have an affair at this stage in her life as a mom. I think Mom realizes, like, now, her friends that have stayed married for, like, 30 years-- you go throughand then you work through that, and I think that you guys are really different. You'll stay in a relationship for ten years if it's misery. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not miserable. I have definitely talked to my mom about her affair before, and I'm not saying that my mom was being selfish on purpose, but I think her actions were definitely selfish. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have this resentment towards Mom. Maybe it would be good to just, like, sit down with her and talk about some things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would rather die. I do not like talking about these kind of things. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but maybe you should. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you ready to go? I'm over this convo. &gt;&gt; KIM: I hate people that run from convos. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't-- what, what is the point of it? &gt;&gt; KIM: To talk about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're searching for magazine. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Have you ever been interested in modeling? &gt;&gt; GIRL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Awkward. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We came here together. I'm not gonna do this by myself. Kendall. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't understand how you could do that to your family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I had to do it all over again, obviously I wouldn't 177 00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:16,995 do it. Are you going to punish me for the rest of mylife? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi there, Gorge. Guess what? Okay, our favorite candies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You stole my candy? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I just went to the store and got 'em. It's sugar-free and it's blueberry. It is so good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am, like, so... Is this really why you're iChatting me? &gt;&gt; KIM: What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sick. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, so how crazy is Kourtney? She's, like, being mean to Mom all over again ever since she wrote that book. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why does she hate her so much? I don't get it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think a lot of it has to do with just even like going through with the divorce, cheating on Dad... everything that, you know, she didn't agree with. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But then is she gonna hold against you? Like, that you... Like, that's not fair to hold against everyone who got a divorce. &gt;&gt; KIM: I also think it's different 'cause Mom had four kids involved. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So what, it just makes her better that she's not married to Scott? And yet she's having a second baby, and so what? If she leaves him later, it's okay 'cause they were never legally married? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't judge someone, like, unless you walk in their shoes. And no one knows exactly what happened between Mom and Dad but Mom and Dad. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so weird, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They need to go to, like, a couple's counseling. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not the same as it used to be. Wait, how cute was this when I used to my own hair and makeup and dress myself and be a normal human being? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now we try too hard... &gt;&gt; KIM: We try way too hard. It's so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at how skinny I was. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think about how skinny I was maybe every day. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll start tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is gonna be awkward, walking up and ask... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Duh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Duh. Okay. We're in Malibu, and we're searching for models for magazine. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall, we have to go down there. We're not gonna sit up here... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, this is perfect. You can see everybody, and then you walk down there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall, you have to actually talk to the person. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I understand, but you're doing the talking, so why don't you go down there? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We came here together. I'm not gonna do this by myself. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Come on. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi, have you ever been interested in modeling? &gt;&gt; GIRL: Uh, no, not really. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, we're from magazine, and we're wondering if you wanted to maybe put your information on a card. Perfect. Where is my sister? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's so awkward. I don't know what to do. This is so much harder than I thought it would be. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Have you ever been interested in modeling? &gt;&gt; GIRL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Awkward. &gt;&gt; MICHELLE: I'm Michelle. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm Kylie. Nice to meet you; have you ever been interested in modeling? Thank you so much. Here's my information. Kendall. I know Kendall's a shy person, but this is an amazing 238 00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:15,750 opportunity, and we're so lucky, and she just needs to get over it and just finish the job. That was fun. Hopefully, next time, you'll do more. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You know I'm a shy person. You can just give me a little credit for talking to some people. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. Kendall, you can get over your fear of, like, being shy. Like, it's so annoying to work with you, like... Like, I'm not gonna do everything. Like, you can't just get bored and sit down and eat. Like, stand up and, like, be professional. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Just because I'm shy doesn't mean I'm not professional. 253 00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:58,053 That has nothing to do with it. You don't say that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. I hear the Mase man. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. I am hosting my first official family dinner since I've moved into my new house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, how have you been feeling? Pregnancy-wise, you've been good? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have we worked on names yet? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have a list. &gt;&gt; KIM: How about Mila? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mila? &gt;&gt; KIM: For Mason and Mila. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Does anybody want salmon instead of chicken? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would love salmon. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: Salmon? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SHARONE: How do you want it cooked? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whatever you think. I think he winked at me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You seriously are an odd one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm odd? Why am I odd? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're just so inappropriate and embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm embarrassing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. You have no shame in your game. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What does "no shame in my game" mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you think it means? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you're rude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's called hormonal. Get used to it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's... you're uptight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's nice, to curse at a pregnant lady. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're insulting me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You curse at pregnant women? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're making comments at your mother. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The child will hear. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You curse a pregnant woman with a child nearby? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so sick and tired of these comments over and and over and over and these little digs-- it's ridiculous. Kourtney, I need to talk to you outside for a second. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come outside with me for a minute? 'Cause this is just getting stupid. I am so sick and tired of you saying rude things to me in front of everyone else. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are the one who brought this all back up again, not me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I brought it up in a memoir, you know why? Because that's what you write about. You write about your life story. Okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't understand how you could do that to your family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't do something on purpose specifically to hurt you or your siblings. I was too young and stupid to make a good decision. If I had to do it all over again, obviously I wouldn't do it, but you're gonna punish me for the rest of mylife because of something I did 25 years ago? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not something I would do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I never would have thought in a million years that Kourtney would still be blaming me for something I did 25 years ago. I'm really just stunned that this is where we still are. We're stuck in this really awful place. You don't think I realized who I hurt by my actions? I've paid a price for what happened to me in my life. And I would hope that none of you have to go through the same things I went through. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I don't want to keep talking about this. I don't relate to it. I don't understand it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She didn't even come with me to, like, talk to the girls. I just felt like she didn't care. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have to, like, meet in the middle. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's with you and your mother arguing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You wouldn't get it; it's just personal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sure it is. You're gonna keep everything in, and then you're gonna blow up one day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look, you got your salmon down here. You got rice down here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you stink. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You smell like a piece of salmon. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're like a big, old fish tank, Mase. What's with you and your mother arguing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't worry. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I am worried. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like you wouldn't get it. You know how we are. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I don't. You don't really tell me how you are; you don't really tell me about a lot of things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just complicated stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What could you be arguing about that you have to go outside? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's always something. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know that, I just don't know why you don't... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's always gonna be something, so just, like, every little thing... It might be personal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sure it is, but who else are you gonna talk to about these things? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just, sometimes, I just can keep it in my brain. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're gonna keep everything in, and then you're gonna blow up one day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then you'll throw a party. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're damn right I will. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think Kourtney being so closed off definitely affects our relationship a lot of times because she doesn't really seem to want to ever get help from anybody. So, it's tiring for me to always be trying to get something out of her, when she's never really looking to release anything. All right, I guess I can't do much else if you're not gonna tell me. I love you anyway. 351 00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,318 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you more, babe. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I bet you do. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kim, I can't find your mustache. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where did my mustache go? How does that one look? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Um, want to see the cards that we got? They're so profesh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want one. Oh, my gosh, "West Coast Fashion Contributor." What do you have to do for this job? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Scouted models and stuff-- it was fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. my gosh, how cute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know, I kind of did the whole thing. 'Cause Kendall is, like, shy or whatever, I don't know; we kind of got in a fight about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She didn't even come with me to talk to the girls. Like, she would just sit there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It wasn't even like... I know she's shy and everything, and, like, I get that, but at least, like, stand there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. And take a picture of the girls or something; like, I just felt like she didn't care. It's just annoying. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is definitely annoying, but I think that, you know, it's definitely Kendall's personality to not be so outspoken and to be shy and to not do that. I used to be so shy, and I would, like, hide behind that because Kourtney and Khloe were so outspoken. But then they, like, helped me get out of my shyness by, like, having me do certain little things here or there when I really needed to step it up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I never thought of it like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: You totally have to, like, figure out what your strengths and your weaknesses are, and you have to meet in the middle. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's not really fair to be mad at Kendall because, uh, she is a shy person. That's who she is. And I like working with Kendall. I think we both bring out different personalities in each other, and together we're much more fun. And I think if we come together and really work together, we can make it work. &gt;&gt; KIM: When are you, um, going out next? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, why don't you just ask Kendall to go, you know, let her know that you need her? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I'll go with you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I would love that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe you can give them makeovers, too, and see how good they look with a mustache. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And if they look good, then you know they're a keeper. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. 397 00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:36,229 &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you say? Aw, that's so cute. It's like a little grandpa. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was just trying to have, like, a moment of privacy. It's just been a really long, crazy, nutty week. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, Kourtney put me through the ringer-- the whole... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, what is the deal with Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I, you know, wrote my book and included what happened in my marriage and having an affair, and I think that, for Kourtney, for some reason it brought back a lot of stuff she didn't want to deal with. For some reason... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's been so long, you know... Remember the good stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's easier, I think, for you to say that because you didn't live through it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was 21 years ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't care if it was five minutes ago or five million years ago. It's still something that's obviously bothering her and it kills me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's obviously bothering you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's bothering me because she's upset that her life could very possibly turn out the way that mine did, and I have to sit and explain to them that what happened in my life happened for a reason, and if I didn't go through that experience, I wouldn't have Kendall and Kylie today, I wouldn't have met you, but I can't control the way that they're still feeling, and it honestly breaks my heart. I don't know how many more times I need to apologize before Kourtney gets this. I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do to have her understand that it wasn't about her or her dad. It was about me. I carried around a lot of guilt for many years. It took me 20 years just to feel good about myself again, and now she's still hurting. You know, it's, it's devastating. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's going to be okay, it's going to be okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just, I don't want her to be... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just dealing with kids, that's all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can handle it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you guys ever eaten 436 00:20:48,977 --> 00:20:54,982 Indian food? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Disgusting, right? Okay, guys, so, energy up. Where are your business cards? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Today Kendall and I are going to scout for models and Kim has come along to help Kendall get over her shyness. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll be right there to support you. Look at me... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. It's nice that they're both here, but it's just-- it's really nerve-racking for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, get off your phone. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look alive, be into it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I really don't know if I can do this right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, there's one right there, there's one right there. Go up to her. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, here we go. Hi, um, my name's Kendall. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Hi, hello. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's my sister Seventeen magazine and we were wondering if you ever thought about modeling, and maybe... &gt;&gt; GIRL: Uh, no, not really. I haven't actually thought of it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Have you ever thought of maybe...? I mean, do you want to maybe do it? &gt;&gt; GIRL: It's definitely a possibility. What would it be for? Seventeen magazine. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Okay, just like a photo shoot in there or...? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Okay, neat. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Just I'll write down your information and maybe take a picture. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Sure, yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks so much. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Thank you very much. Have a good day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. Okay, that was good, that was good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Once I talked to the first person, I realized it's really not that hard. &gt;&gt; KIM: What about that girl right there? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Excuse me, wait. Hi, I'm Kendall and this is my sister Kylie, and we were wondering if you've ever thought about modeling. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Well, thanks, guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall, you're doing so good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm excited for you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hello. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, my name is Kendall, and that's my sister Kylie. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at Kendall. She's fully talking to them and doing it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall has definitely come out of her shell, and this is insane. I am so in shock, but I'm so happy that she is feeling more comfortable talking to people. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Cool, thank you so much. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Thanks, girls. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. We're done. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. Cool, wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, let's go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Leggo. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Good job, Ken. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think that I am less shy now that my sisters have helped me come through this and conquer my fear, and I feel like I can talk to people now and, you know, like, get candy from strangers or something. &gt;&gt; KIM: You did so good. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You really did. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why should you go crazy every time you see a spider? It's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My parents got a divorce because my mom had an 496 00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:29,482 affair. Like, I could never do that to my children. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Press "X." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got it. Ready. Whoops, I just lost it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Not that one-- the one on the screen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, man, I just lost it again. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, stop pressing it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Take it on mine, I'll e-mail it to you, I'll text it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Just press that, okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, but I... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Don't touch anything else on the screen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not. Got it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My dad is taking us on a hike right now. It'll be nice to get out after Seventeen magazine and doing that little operation. We need to get Louis neutered. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We need to get Louis neutered. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you're not gonna neuter the dog. We went through this with Kim and that dog. You didn't get him neutered. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: They hump each other all day long, Dad. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: They're brother and sister. This is like incest. &gt;&gt; KIM: Control the pet population-- Bob Barker would have said that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, why would you pick it up? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Pick it up. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, 'cause he's not spraying on me. He's right there. Come here. Oh, girls, and they are so afraid of spiders. Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, stop! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How did you even see that? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am not going on a hike with you anymore. It's just not funny. Like, I'm so afraid of spiders. It's a known fact. I can't control myself, I scream, I cry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's a spider on you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! (Kim, Kylie, and Kendall screaming) &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This little thing and that reaction. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you know this about me-- he obviously does-- don't, like, encourage it. Don't, like, try and scare me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you going? Everybody, come back here. Everybody's leaving me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, he wants to mess around with me and joke around. Well, Mr. Olympics can hurdle his way home. He can sprint, javelin his way, whatever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello! Mason, stick your tongue out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's cute. Do you miss KoKo? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So how's good old Texas? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Grand slam. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You missed our family dinner last night. The first dinner I've ever had in my house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How was it, though? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom came over. She was kind of annoying. And we just have not been getting along lately. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys never get along. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. Lately, I've been even more mean, and I can't help my attitude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you talk to, like, Scott about it? Or do you ever, like, been to him, and what does he think? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I don't know. I just feel like he doesn't understand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like therapy for you and Mom might be really good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I literally have gone by myself, and I, like, hated Scott when I went. And by the time I walked out, I liked him again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you do that about Mom? Maybe you'll like her after you leave. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When I was younger, I tried to go to therapy with my mom, together, and it was such a disaster. But maybe it's not the worst idea for me to go to therapy by myself, and talk to my therapist about the issues that I have with my mom. I'm glad you sit around and analyze me. All right, well, can you hurry and come home already? You're like, the one person who does not annoy me and get on my nerves. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah, man. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kimmy. I knew you were coming over for dinner. &gt;&gt; KIM: Weirdo. Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not. No, everything's fine. Hey, though, before you get started, come here. Just for a second. &gt;&gt; KIM: What, you want to have a heart-to-heart? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just come here. Yeah, that's it. &gt;&gt; KIM: So annoying. What is that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's just another little spider. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have another spider? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And every time you come over here, you still have the same phobia. &gt;&gt; KIM: I-I don't need to get over spider phobias. What is it gonna do to have it in a jar? Keep it as a pet? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why should you go crazy every time you see a spider? It's ridiculous. Kim's got to get over this. She's overreacting to this thing. The drama going on. It's a little spider. We're having a little bit of fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce, come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just trying to help you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce, don't come close to me with that. Seriously?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What happened? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That was the fastest I've ever seen you run. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, it's not funny. It's not funny. I don't know how Bruce thinks this is gonna help me get over my fear of spiders. He is insane. He has lost it. I am furious at him. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim, come back. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kim, we were kidding. Dad, that was not cool. She ran out of the house literally almost crying. That's not gonna help her get over her fear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You really think I'm being too harsh? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You threw a spider at her; you know how much she hates them. 606 00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:39,183 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, she'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, Dad, that was not cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? &gt;&gt; ERICA: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. Good to see you. I definitely don't want to always be giving my mom an attitude, so I decided to call my therapist, Erica, and talk to her about, you know, the situation with me and my mom. &gt;&gt; ERICA: So tell me how you've been. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like last time, when I talked to you, the whole time I talked about Scott and that was it, but I felt so much better. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Good! Good. That's great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: After I left, I was like, "That was necessary." 'Cause I had, like, so much annoyance built up. But, um, lately I've been giving my mom an attitude, and, like, I feel guilty about it. &gt;&gt; ERICA: The problem with the mother-daughter relationship sometimes also is that there's almost a little bit of this inherent competition, even if you don't mean it to be there. So I think that there might be a little bit of a hypersensitivity to the fact that you're being mean to her because you know that you're having a daughter. And there is no stronger bond or attachment than the mother-daughter one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm very excited to have a little girl, but they definitely say that girls, they fight with their moms all the time, and that just terrifies me. My mom wrote a book about her past, and it talks... Like, my parents got a divorce because my mom had an affair. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I think, so, lately, it's been, like, bringing up issues like that. And since I have kids, and I know that, like, I could never do that to my children, and... : Sorry. &gt;&gt; ERICA: It's okay. That's a hard one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I just feel like I don't understand, now, especially more, her decision. And I think that it just has been bothering me. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are we gonna do to get Dad back? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Scared of anything? &gt;&gt; KIM: What if someone steals the Ferrari? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That'll get him scared. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What the hell? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I decided to buy you your shower gift. You don't seem that excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Her solution is to, like, buy our affection. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to open this now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, I'm not mad about her writing about it. I don't care about people knowing or anything like that. I just think lately, since my brother was, like, the same age as Mason is now, as when she had the affair. So, it's not like we were all, like, so grown up. I mean, obviously, Scott and I have problems all the time, but I still can't see, like, where she was coming from. But I also don't want to, like, hold on to that. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Whether it's Mom or Dad, but in this case it's Mom, how could she do that to us? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ERICA: You know, and in reality, and you know that as a mom, you would never intentionally do anything to hurt your kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ERICA: And so, it's not an excuse, but I think the other part of this: you have trust issues with Scott. There are those issues in your relationship, and so to your credit, you know that about your relationship, and you're getting help. And you see the benefits of that, and maybe there's part of you that's pissed at your mom that she took a different route. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Marriage isn't perfect. Relationships are not perfect, no matter what. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just even acknowledging that it is bothering me and then consciously not give her an attitude because of it. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Yeah. I think that's what will be most helpful for the two of you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I agree. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll tell you how 679 00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:30,182 it goes. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you two get a spray tan? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. I had a photo shoot, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: "Orange" you glad you got one? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Stop. You get one every single night. &gt;&gt; KIM: But not orange, like that. 688 00:32:55,938 --> 00:32:59,074 So what are we going to do to get Dad back? Like, what do we... what could we do to scare him? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He's not scared of anything. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to, like, physically scare him. 694 00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:10,617 I want him to be like... You know? I know, why is he Superman? What if it's, he... someone steals the Ferrari? 'Cause I have the other key. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And then you get so mad at him. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then he doesn't know what to do, because I get so mad at him. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, but how are we going to know where he is, and that he's taking that car? &gt;&gt; KIM: I say we call like Brandon or Brody. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Brandon? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, it's Kim, Kendall, and Kylie. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Wow, how's it going, guys? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. So, we need your help with something. We are trying to scare your dad. He asked me to borrow my Ferrari, 'cause he wanted to drive it. We need to figure out where he's gonna go, but we don't want to be the one to ask him. And maybe we'll, like, pick up the car from wherever he goes, and he'll think it's stolen. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 'Cause Kim has a spare key. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's a great idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so glad that Brandon is on board for this prank, because now Bruce'll finally get worked up, 'cause he never gets worked up. So I'm just so anxious to see how this goes. But will... I want to see him get, like, scared. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He will get scared. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That-that will make him scared. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I really do like the stolen Ferrari idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Okay, that's what we might go with. Call us later. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Okay. 726 00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:39,127 &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the hell are you wearing? I feel like you almost look... a little royal. Like, I almost feel like I'm in, Coming to America. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was the look I was going for. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: State your business, please. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I walked all the way over here to tell you... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're going to tell me something personal for once? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like you never tell me anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, but I was telling Erica how I don't tell you these kind of things... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You tell me nothing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sorry that I didn't open up to you the other day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you forget that you have me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, but sometimes it's about my family, and it doesn't... it's like, from me growing up... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is your family! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And it's home! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY : ...it's about me growing up. That doesn't have to do with you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I care about stuff that happened to you when you were a kid. I would tell you things that happened to me, 'cause you're, like, the only person I would turn to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely do need to open up to Scott and share with him. I just think that, you know, overall, for our family, it's the best thing that I can do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not gonna be on the same page with you, babe. We got a long road in front of us. You know, you keep popping these kids out like Tic Tacs, I mean, we're gonna have a whole family to raise. Thanks for opening up, babe. How much do I owe you for the psychic reading? Chops. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Chips down. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hit me with a kiss. Love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Was it worth it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT:, yeah, babe. ♫ Arabian night ♫ &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How's that Ferrari out there? Thing's pretty amazing, yeah? Have you been driving it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Sometimes. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I like it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah? Is it rough? It's a rough ride, though, probably, huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Dad likes it better than I do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When she drops it off, I'll get to drive it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are you guys going? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Not a bad deal. We're gonna go, uh, to the Go-cart track. &gt;&gt; KIM: You want to take it? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: He wants to get me back, and... If you're serious, that would be... I mean, I don't want to, like... I don't want to... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, let me get the key. So Bruce thinks that he's going to the go-cart track to go and have fun with Brandon, but little does he know, as soon as they get in there, we're gonna go and pick up the Ferrari with my spare key. Bruce will have no idea that we're really tricking him. So, I left the key in there, but I have the spare. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I think I know where to park. And then you guys just come and take it. We'll just do a couple laps and stuff and... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I'll see you later. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Cool. Bye, Kim. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, where am I going now? &gt;&gt; KIM: The car's right there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Take the car, obviously. Let's park it somewhere where he'll never see it. Then we'll come back and watch and see him freak out when the car's not here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'm gonna follow you to find out where I should park at. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, just put it over there where he can't see it. But go quick, so, just in case he comes out. &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot wait to see the look on Bruce's face when he freaks out, knowing that my Ferrari is missing or stolen. So now, we sit here and wait. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I hope he freaks out. Okay, here they come. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Different lanes. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, yeah... &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't you think, like, he sees us kind of? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Feel like he's looking right at us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The thing and, uh... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Where's the car? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was right there. What the hell?! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look-- he's freaking out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, here they come. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The thing and, uh... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Where's the car? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was right there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look-- he's freaking out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You should just call the cops. It's, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. I think we should kind of duck if they walk any more this way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just walked out. I mean, I came out once 'cause I put my bottle in there... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I bet your mom's ripping him one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Had my glasses in there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He really probably thinks that he's going nuts and senile. Like, legit. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's a Ferrari. That's not an easy thing to steal. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, let's drive up. I say we go in this car just 827 00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:11,128 because, then we'll... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, and I'll open the window. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't need any roadside assistance, do you? I think someone's in on it. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's for getting the spider on me! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was thinking, how the hell did they ever get the car? It was locked. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You could have swallowed it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good job, Brandon. Good job. You pulled it off. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, I feel real... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you were in on it, too? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course he was! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No! That's not even fair! I can't believe my little Kimmy pulled this thing off. No, I know it's not right that I mess with her. Maybe throwing spiders on Kim is... ...a little bit too much, but it was fun. But Kim, good job. You got me. Just get in the damn car! Where are myglasses? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney? So I decided to buy you your shower gift now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I got... Because I went into a... I went to Fred Segal, and I went a little cray-cray. So, I want you to see it. And I'm really excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. What's the bottom thing? Just pink boxes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. You don't seem that excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really appreciate the gift that my mom's giving me, but it's always her solution is to, like, buy our affection with gifts. No! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to open this now. 858 00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:44,408 Come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. What's the bottom thing? Just pink boxes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't seem that excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really appreciate the gift that my mom's giving me, but it's always her solution is to, like, buy our affection with gifts. No! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to open this now. Come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. I really just want to have an honest conversation with her so that I can move forward and put this behind me. I just wanted to tell you that, um, I went to therapy, and we were talking about you, like, the whole time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was talking about just how I haven't been that nice to you lately, and I, like, take things out on you, or just make little rude comments here and there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I realized in the therapy session that it's more stuff that I need to heal, within myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nothing's perfect. And I've learned along the way, too. I wasn't... I didn't know everything when I was 30 years old. And I realize a lot of things are a lot different than I thought they would turn out to be at my age now than I did 20, 30 years ago. And that's where you are. Out of all my children, Kourtney is the one that really doesn't express herself so much. She keeps everything locked inside. I had no idea that something from my behavior in the past would have such a profound effect on Kourtney today. But the fact that she's doing something about it, and opening up to me... is pretty fabulous. I don't really expect a lot. I just want to be loved. And I think that you would want the same thing from your kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All I'm saying is, there's baby steps and I'm going to work on it, and, like, communicate more with what I'm annoyed about instead of just giving you an attitude. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So can we just take that little step, and then just move on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: From this very second, yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Thank you for my present. I love it. 900 00:42:51,618 --> 00:42:53,820 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello, there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank goodness I brought my iPhone so I can communicate with you guys at this lovely dinner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KIM: We got Bruce back. So I'm going to have dinner with Bruce, just so he can make it up to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh... my God! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, stay. Stay right here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stay right here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I hate them! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kim, come on in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing, you guys? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're trying to get over your fear. &gt;&gt; KIM: By eating spiders? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, we're not going to eat the spiders. We're gonna develop a relationship with them, and they're going to find out that they're really okay. Maybe it's time we take a softer, more gentle approach to having a fear of spiders. Maybe she could just get to know the spiders. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why don't you just name them? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'll name them Charlotte and Wilbur. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Just talk to Charlotte. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Char-Char. How ya doin'? Was that okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's good! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There you go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you all happy? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, that was good! &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, leave me alone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm doing fine! I'm doing fine! &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, now you've lost it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get me out of this cage. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I'm sitting next to a spider, and I'm being totally calm, and it's really not affecting me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you know when you really don't have a phobia towards, uh, spiders? Is when you eat 'em! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. You guys are crazy. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good job, Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, honey. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; ROB: You're weirding me out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Child, why? Mason, it's Kiki! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the hell? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's afraid of me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I would be, too! This family really is going downhill quick. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! 943 00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:40,301 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. KIM: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; ROB: Bruce is the hardest guy to relate to in the world. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You really hurt Bruce's feelings And nothing hurts Bruce's feelings.
