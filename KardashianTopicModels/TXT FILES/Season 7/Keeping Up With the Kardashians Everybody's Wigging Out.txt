- &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? No, I'm just going on up to the office. Yeah. No, I'm late for, like, three meetings. Whew. Don't let me forget to call Suzanne at 11:30. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: 11:30. Yep. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I'm starting to really stress out a little bit. Now we have a bazillion offers on the table. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't even get a Pap smear, I'm so busy. Sorry, I've had way too much coffee this morning. I'm, like, all wound up because I just got off this red-eye. But I need to go through about three million e-mails. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I've got a two-hour window right after this next meeting, so I really need to go to Costco. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Okay, why don't we just have one of the assistants go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because it's, like, my favorite thing in the world to do is go to Costco and get my own stuff and get Bruce's cookies, and get my steak. But these people are in the other room ready, so let's go to this meeting, and just... Don't judge me. I just want to scream, I'm so overwhelmed. Okay, I feel better now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, you won't even believe my day. I just, like, had the 28 00:01:24,528 --> 00:01:28,565 most stressful attorney's meeting. Like, it's just... it... I think someone just wants to make it really difficult. When one person wants a divorce and the other one just is pissed, you know, they want to do whatever they can to make life difficult, you know? My divorce has been really draining, really stressful. I don't like who I am in this marriage. I just want to leave this chapter of my life behind me. I don't want to be married anymore. Do you want to say "I told you so?" 'Cause you, you, you have, like, that power. Okay. I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. 41 00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:35,313 &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Probably nobody's going to eat the chicken. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'll eat the chicken. What about the sausage? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You want a little sausage? We got a little sausage. How long were you in England? &gt;&gt; ROB: For like a month. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A month? &gt;&gt; ROB: I was in London. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where is your sock thing at? &gt;&gt; ROB: Actually, we just got a manufacturer. You know, I made a lot of progress while I was in Europe. I actually met a manufacturer who I'm gonna, you know, do my sock line with. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, now we're cooking. Look at that. Just a minute over on this side... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bob, you're home! &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, man, Dick! Hey, I've missed my Dick. Hey, Dick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, that's good. The Godfather. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's more than that. &gt;&gt; ROB: I need to find something, but... I need a plan. I need your help. I'm paying, what, your mortgage? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ROB: On a one-bedroom apartment. &gt;&gt; KIM: You need something, like, cool and modern. For him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What about Kourtney... like with Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KIM: The Wilshire corridor would be perfect for him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The minute he... gets a place in the city, he will want to sell it and get a place here. Okay? &gt;&gt; ROB: This is the first time in my life that I'm looking for a home that I'm gonna own. Like, it's a big deal for me, so I kind of want to take my mom's advice and kind of learn from everything. Just, make the right decision. &gt;&gt; KIM: You gave me the same advice, as far as living in the Valley. I think you don't get it. Like... foreseeable future. It's not like he can afford a huge house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's the same amount of money. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can't get him a... there's no apartments here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Advice my father gave me many, many years ago... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, here we go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You gotta find out what area you want to live. You want to be out here? You want to be in the city? You gotta make that decision first. &gt;&gt; ROB: But like, you know, now Kim thinks that I'll get... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not what Kim thinks; it's what you want. With this family, everybody's got an opinion: where he should live, where he shouldn't live. Choosing a house is extremely important. That's his decision. Let him do it on his own. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know, man. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Find out where you want to live. Then figure out how to make it there. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're cold, yeah. Hi, Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, no, I don't have any more service up here. Tomorrow? I have a 7:00 and an 8:30. I could meet you at noon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me is this phone keeps going out because she has no service, and I've got two different, like, carriers here and I can't seem to make a phone call. Where's everybody else that's supposed to be at the family dinner? Let's do the dinner. 'Cause I mean, I have to be up at 4:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just pregnant Kourtney, relax. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am in L.A. for literally 24 hours. And my mother... She's on the phone, handling business calls. She walks in on a conference call. Like, relax and spend time. "How are you? Oh, you look great." Like, none of that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, come on so we can eat. We're not going to wait for anybody else. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney's here! No cell phones during dinner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I used to have that rule. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, could you put your cell phones over here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. I'm not even gonna stay that long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause I have no service, and I can't be without service. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I'm never in L.A. and you're really going to do that again? &gt;&gt; KIM: Know what that is? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could we get the next course maybe going? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Ready to go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you're so rude. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I... no. It means that I love the food. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you in such a hurry? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't have any service here, and it's making me have a rash. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This dinner is kind of a bust because my mother is rushing the dinner. I mean, I really miss just living in moment with my family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I don't stay connected, things are falling apart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, calm down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I gotta go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're in there, Mason was like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's been great. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye, love you. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Bye, love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom just seems so stressed out. It just seems like she's taken on way too much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Gotta go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, losing focus of the family time that we just really want. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I wonder... how much months are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does it bother you when people touch your stomach? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but today I feel uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: How often do you get that shave that you always get? I've been meaning to talk to you about the shave thing. &gt;&gt; ROB: I go once a week. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you don't know how to shave yourself? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't do it, like, properly. He uses a straight razor, so it's all the way down... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like... this. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. It's old school. Listen, I had Josh find some houses to... so we can look at them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So we'll go look. When do you want to go look? &gt;&gt; ROB: Wednesday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't go Wednesday. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've got meetings from morning till night. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll take you. Hey, be like guys' day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You'll take him? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think I should go with him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're, like, not the kind of person who cares about houses. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, if you can't go, I should go. I love to look at houses. Me and Rob. It'd be great. I don't know if Kris is the best one to go with him to buy a house. To be honest with you, I think, as far as househunting, he should go with me. And you know what? I can take that "house hunting" uh... off of Kris' to-do list, and she can go do something else. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, it's like the blind leading the blind. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Keep it in perspective, what you can handle, what you can't handle... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're going to keep somebody in check financially? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah! I'm basically pretty cheap. And Rob needs to be cheap. He's just getting started. It's his first house. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's things that you don't like kind of talk to Bruce about, and he like, does his golfing, his helicopters, he knows his cars, and that's about it. But with the houses, I definitely, like, want my mom's opinion and not Bruce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, well, good luck with him. 'Cause he doesn't know what he's doing. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom, he's right there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Settled. I'll take him. Wednesday. It's a date, Rob. 182 00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:12,660 &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. You got it, see you there. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. We are just looking at some fun wigs. &gt;&gt; SALESWOMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want something totally different. &gt;&gt; SALESWOMAN: We have some fun, funky ones right over here. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I mean, if you're gonna do it, you got to really do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's try the blue, the pink... I want to try this one. &gt;&gt; SALESWOMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe's talk really inspired me just to have more fun, and I'm kind of obsessed with 007. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah, baby. I'm scared of you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want it. This is what I'm going to look like when I'm 50. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, so Storm. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Like a Russian spy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Being silly and trying on all these wigs just reminds me, back in the day, how Kourtney and I would always play dress-up. Having fun, and that's what life should be about. This is cute. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I think that she's the winner overall. Put it there, pal. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; CASHIER: You're welcome. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where is he? &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Straight back and to the left. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. Wow. I'm meeting with Babyface. How are you? &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: Good, how are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we're going to discuss our new music management company that we want to put together and really find ways that would incorporate his amazing talent and my management skills. We start lining up the roster, it'll be next-- who can we listen to next? &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: With my expertise and your expertise, I think we can-- people can know about them, you know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: And, uh, and I think that's ultimately it, is giving them a place where they can be heard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think one thing no one realizes about this whole process is how many meetings it takes. I get up at 4:00 a.m. to deal with New York and all the things I need to do with the girls, but with Babyface, it's a whole new world of being up like a night owl and it's starting to take its toll. I want to record a song. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: We can always do that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You could produce the out of it so that it actually sounded good. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: We'll Auto-Tune it big-time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Auto-Tune. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wish you could Auto- Tune my whole life. I hate it when people, like, pretend like they're good drivers, and they don't even know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you trying to hint something to me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's crazy people driving out here. You have to have, like, defensive driving skills. What the? Like, are you kidding, you ? Okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I never honk at people, Mom, don't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, we're honking because they're idiots. Yeah, whatever. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don'twith me, mother &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's not necessary to push the horn. 246 00:11:04,886 --> 00:11:09,690 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, come on, you jerk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm the one who gets suckered into seeing every house with every family member. &gt;&gt; ROB: We don't need to wait for anyone. So I asked Kourtney to come, you know, look at homes with me 'cause my mom couldn't and Bruce just isn't going to cut it for me. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: It's a duplex. &gt;&gt; ROB: Right, duplex, that's what it's called. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: But it's cut in half. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: So it's all stainless steel appliances. Nice size, you know, for a guy. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, this is definitely really cool. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: That's what I'm saying. We're talking about location right here. Over here this whole area is yours. You have a fire pit, TV, hot tub. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's cool. &gt;&gt; ROB: That-- yeah. Kourtney also is really smart with her money. Like, I do respect her opinion, and she's a lot better than Bruce. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: Where are you guys living right now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Calabasas. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: You are in Calabasas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do love it there, though. It's perfect for, like, kids. Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the bachelor pad, but you do need to clean up all these leaves so you still need a gardener. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's check it out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We checked it out. &gt;&gt; ROB: We checked it out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honestly, I'm surprised. I'm just a couple minutes late, and they've already looked at the house, and, you know, Kourtney's here. You know, Rob and I can make this decision. We don't need all these people. Is this my room, Rob? No, like city taxes and all that kind of stuff on top of it. So, Rob, is this, like, in your price range? 1.5? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm just looking. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What about a garage? Do they have even a garage here? &gt;&gt; ROB: This isn't like something I've settled on, at all, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I understand that. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's just, whoops... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You just got to look at everything. I mean, we're here. Look at it all. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, well, let's go to the next house. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm kind of wondering right now, is Rob bringing all these people in... into this househunting, you know, because he doesn't trust my opinion? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Move it! Go ahead, you stupid! Whoa! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, you're a psychopath. &gt;&gt; ROB: Honestly, if Dad was around, I would actually, like, have somebody to kind of lead me in the right direction. You guys are just making it worse. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Don't you think it's, like, a waste of Bruce's time to even drive all the way from Calabasas to the city for no apparent reason? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, he obviously wants to give his input, and help you make the right decision. &gt;&gt; ROB: I know. I mean, I appreciate that. It's obviously like he's trying to be involved, but I just do not value his opinion when it comes to, like, houses and certain things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just think he wants you to make a smart decision, which I totally agree. You shouldn't overextend yourself. &gt;&gt; ROB: Of course, I understand that. I'm not going to go try and buy a$10 million house. It's just so hard to relate to Bruce. 313 00:13:54,811 --> 00:14:00,615 He's, like, the hardest guy to relate to in the world. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: So how was your dinner? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. Betty did a great job, as usual. There's plenty left over, honey, if you want to eat, but I guess you're going out to dinner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am. I have an 8:00 meeting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know I don't have enough time in the day to do all the meetings that I have. So I've got to do one tonight with Kenny. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think my mom takes on way too much. She doesn't even make dinner anymore. She used to make dinner every single night, and now she has, like, a chef come. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What time are you gonna be back? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know these music people. They're on a different schedule. They start a lot later, and they go a lot later. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, don't be late. Don't be late. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll be as late as I need to. 332 00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:45,715 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye! &gt;&gt; KRIS: See you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: I asked Kim to come househunting with me, and she asked me to meet her at this bookstore to buy coffee table books. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, honey. Hi. &gt;&gt; ROB: I honestly can't even take you seriously like this. That's your, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, Robert! I've always wanted to be a Southern belle, so today I'm gonna have a little fun with Robbie. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why are you talking like this? You're just weirding me out right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, honey boo-boo child, why? &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim is having this, like, blond persona. She has a wig, and... I really don't know what, like, her intention is. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I can help you look at some houses. &gt;&gt; ROB: No. Not if you're gonna talk like that. I'm not taking you anywhere. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, this advice comes with a price, honey. Get that book, pay for it, and let's get out of here. Do you have any CDs for accents? &gt;&gt; CLERK: Yeah. They're right over here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Seriously, what's up with you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think you should try it. It is so liberating. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know. It's like, what are you doing? It's just weird. It's not liberating. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, so where are these houses we're gonna go look at? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean, no? &gt;&gt; ROB: You gotta change and take off your wig, and like put on some jeans. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you talking about? Are you for real? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? Are you embarrassed of me? Oh, Robbie. &gt;&gt; ROB: This process is not a joke to me. This is my first home. I'm buying it. I'm not gonna bring her along if she's gonna be some weirdo. Put on some jeans and flats and 371 00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:23,687 take the wig off and meet me at the house. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; BENNY: How are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is my friend Benny. This is Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Benny. How are you? &gt;&gt; BENNY: Hi, how are you? It's good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She just wants to find some wheels for her daughter. I'm with Scott today to go get the rims for Kendall's car that I promised her for her birthday months ago. This is going to be fun, especially since I have about 14 minutes until my next meeting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She wants all black. I know that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How long does it take to put them on the car? &gt;&gt; BENNY: Once they're here, half hour. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you don't have anything in stock like we could have today? &gt;&gt; BENNY: Um... we could probably find something. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You have to be patient. Like, just, he'll order them and she'll get them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not a very patient person. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, you're definitely not. I'm doing Kris a favor by taking time out of my day, and she's rushing me! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can handle it, 'cause I don't have time for this anymore. All right. Take good care of my daughter. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; BENNY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's a weird thing to say to these guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My buddy will give a good deal, I know that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? You're like the wholesale king. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I like a deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead, you stupid! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, hey... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, honestly! Like, what a dumb driver. What is wrong with people? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got a lot of rage in you, kid. I mean, that person was just trying to drive their car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That person was going to get smashed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This broad is out of her mind. And I'm worried. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Move it! All right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You need to calm down a little bit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, part of the problem is I'm just, like, completely exhausted. Whoa! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, you're a psychopath! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That person just went in front of me again! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. I'm never driving with you again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: My name's Natasha. I'm on a secret mission. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the hell? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you afraid of me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am going to lose my You're going to make me 423 00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,273 psychotic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You already are psychotic. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can we turn on the air? Put it to 68. &gt;&gt; KIM:My name is Natasha. I'm on a secret mission. Hello! Why are you afraid of me? Mason, it's Kiki. Just give me a hug. Why are you...? Why are you afraid? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the hell? &gt;&gt; KIM: He's afraid of me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I would be, too. Kim is in my house running around with this little red wig. She honestly looks like Chucky, and it's scaring the hell out of my child. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why do you have 438 00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:10,308 a wig? &gt;&gt; KIM:It just is like a spy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm really uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is this for? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why does it have to be for anything? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This isn't fun. It's uncomfortable. The whole family's losing their damn mind. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's the problem? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When Kim shows up to my house with a red wig on I'm just really confused. I hope that Kim's looming divorce isn't getting to her head and making her go crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Would you like to go out to lunch? I'm hungry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't have anyone to eat with in Calabasas. No one knows me in this town. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wonder why. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You sound like a, like a transvestite. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't stay in one place too long. I gotta go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What a weirdo. This family really is going downhill quick. It's not normal behavior. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, Rob, what are you doing, looking for houses? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm waiting for Mom so we can go look at homes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you really think that's the best thing? To go with Mom? Sometimes these girls can be very, uh... overwhelming, demanding. I don't want them pushing you around and getting you into something that's gonna be something more than you can afford. &gt;&gt; ROB: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's a lot of powerful, strong, opinionated women in my family. I want to make sure that Rob is... he's not just rushing into something. Make sure that he finds a house, that's the right house for him that he can afford, that he's gonna be happy at. I went online... and I looked in areas, particularly this area out here because you know Mom likes to keep you close. This is an idea about some of the stuff we can, uh, we can go look at. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, well, I have, you know, professionals, Realtors that I trust, looking into all that, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think you should do as much research as you can-- that's why I got this stuff-- on your own. &gt;&gt; ROB: I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's free. &gt;&gt; ROB: It is free. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My advice is free. &gt;&gt; ROB: Um... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob? &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom just texted me and said she's running late, so I'm just gonna get out of here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What'd she do, stand you up? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yep. It's all good. But you have a good day. Go hit some balls or something. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob, take this with you. Rob, look at this stuff. Rob! &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, I love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Take it with you! Here you go. Take it with you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob! &gt;&gt; ROB: Love you. 490 00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,992 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'll remember this. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need you to come by here at some point today and sign all of these documents. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm working all day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, that's a problem because I need you to come here and sign this stuff so I can get it back to the attorneys, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, can you just send a messenger? I'm, like, working. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not gonna give a messenger these kind of documents, Kim, because... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mom, I'm working. You know you booked me. I'm in West Hollywood. I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'm gonna head over there now. I've got a meeting with Babyface tonight, so I've got to get all the way back here and then go all the way back to his studio. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so be ready. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, love you. I cannot believe I now have to drive all the way into town and go to Hollywood. No, no, no, no, no, you can't drink out of the thing that everyone uses. That's disgusting. You put it in a dishwasher which is 10,000 degrees. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you are really like a teenager. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have no idea what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris, lately, is getting a little bit out of hand. She lashes out on the people that love her the most. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am going to lose my! You're going to make me psychotic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You already are psychotic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm leaving right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, come on. Let's do this quick. &gt;&gt; KIM: Quick, quick, quick, chop, chop, chop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Great, thanks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How's the househunting going? &gt;&gt; ROB: Most of my friends, they always, like, they ask their dads for opinions. I feel like I don't have someone to kind of lean on. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would love to send somebody else to get Kim's signature on all these documents, but they're private. They're confidential. 531 00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:47,578 If I don't do it, it's not gonna get done. I'm late. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, come on. Let's do this quick. I have to get a pen. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, quick, quick, quick, chop, chop, chop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do me a favor and sign right there where it says "signature." &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you filling in a credit card there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't need a credit card, honey. This is a contract, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, so efficient you are that one, my manager. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Great. Thanks. Okay, I'll see you later. Bye, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom seems so stressed out. I mean, she doesn't even know I'm wearing a red wig. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys, it's a family dinner. Come on now. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'll get on it tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott and Kris. Come on, you guys. Yummy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't you tell her about that story up in New York? &gt;&gt; ROB: Sorry. The one where I got a three-quarter chub? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. What does a three-quarter chub mean? &gt;&gt; ROB: You figure it out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: One-quarter away from a full-blown &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you know what-- &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A little chubby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob? &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How's the househunting going? Have you looked at anything else? &gt;&gt; ROB: I've been trying to deal with it. I mean, it's like the most stressful process trying to find, like, a home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I said I'll go with you. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just feel like most of my friends, they always, like, they ask their dads for opinions on decisions like this. I feel like I don't have someone to kind of lean on to, you know, get advice from. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your mom has, like, bought and sold, like, 100 different houses. I mean, I'm sure she knows what to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Biggest decision you're gonna make. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, you guys just constantly keep asking me, asking me, "What's the deal? What's the deal?" And it's just, like, honestly, if Dad was around, I would actually, like, have somebody to kind of help me with my decision and kind of lead me in the right direction. I feel like you guys are just making it worse. All right, I'm out of here, guys. Thanks for giving me so much &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you just gonna leave? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, Rob. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: See ya, Bob. 578 00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:56,406 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's been great. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's been real. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're not gonna listen. You really don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, honey, I really care. I just have these e-mails I have to check. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It just hurts, you know? All this work that I've done, and it hurts. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, gals. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, Kourtney, 589 00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:34,634 give me the damn phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For your health and sanity, relax. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. Kim invited Kylie and I to dinner, and I'm really excited to just catch up with her and see what's going on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, gals. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh... my God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. You look exactly like Mom. This is so weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, I am Mom. You know I try to be one of the girls, one of the sisters, but I am Mom. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, you look exactly like... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: With your scarf and and your blazer... &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. Fabulous mother. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: And just look... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And the earrings? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I can't take it. 605 00:27:25,104 --> 00:27:30,041 You look crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm about to cry. Don't insult me like that! Did you order some food? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, for real though, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why are you wearing a wig? &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you girls sing? I'm gonna get you ladies a 611 00:27:43,551 --> 00:27:50,189 record deal. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is not fun. This is weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, ladies, I'll see you at home. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye, Mom. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God, we have like matching cars! This is... &gt;&gt; KIM: Mother and daughter cars. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, mother-daughter cars. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've got the mom. 619 00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:09,903 You've got the baby. Bye. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Like, open door. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, that was so weird. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: People, like, are actually going to think she's starting to... she's starting to lose her mind. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. We need to have a little talk with her. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Masey! Say bye-bye to Grandma. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've got a meeting with Babyface in a few minutes and I'm late. Can I have a kiss? &gt;&gt; MASON: No! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kiss me. Please? I'll give you a present. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, Mom, stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, thank you! Okay, love you guys. Mason, I owe you one. Love you, gotta go! Meeting with Babyface. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love you! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Toodles! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So I think Mom's working too hard. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, she is. She never stops. Like even when she's supposedly stopped, she still doesn't, like, enjoy the moment. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She left the house at 4:45 this morning. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I was driving with Mom the other day, and she has major road rage. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So what are we going to do about Mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But if she has time to herself to, like, relax and not be always working... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, but how's she gonna? 'Cause she's got all these mobile devices. She can keep in contact with the world. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's got to turn her phone off. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We all make priorities. Khloe makes Lamar. Kim is good. She'll get a massage. One. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mama! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Force her into time off. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kourtney suggests that we force my mom into taking a break, and I completely agree. I think she deserves a break, needs a break, and I think it'll just calm her down a little bit. &gt;&gt; MASON: Grandpa, watch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Grandpa, watch. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! That was good. Now jump into my arms. Wow! A good one. Okay, now, let's go a little farther. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That doesn't look very safe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go! Yay! That was a good jump. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't like that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yay! Good one! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, we're done with that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So? The final decision on Mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll tell her. I don't care. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go find your trucks. You'll tell her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll tell her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where's Grandpa? He's right here. &gt;&gt; MASON: Grandpa! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I'm coming! &gt;&gt; MASON: Wow! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where is she? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think she's upstairs getting ready. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're having a relaxing day for your mother. It's you and me, babe. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Let's go. Mommy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourtney. What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am here 'cause we are forcing you to have a relaxing day. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think that we're definitely gonna have to pry the Blackberry out of her hand. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're going to have to give up your phone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, I'd love to... Give me the damn phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, Kourtney, stop screwing around. Give me my phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going to put one in my butt crack... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, give me my phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and one in my vagin. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me the phone. I can't even go after you because you're pregnant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just telling you, for your health and sanity, you can take a day off to relax. You don't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like to have a good time just as much as the next person, but I don't have time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Put on some sweats. I'm getting you an outfit. Here you go. You're lucky that we even want to spend time with you... in your old age. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, praise God. Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, so let's downstairs and have some fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I put these sweats on and spend an hour with you, will you leave me alone then? Kourtney and Kendall think that they can force me into having a relaxing day? It's sort of silly. I can't relax. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We'll let you get dressed. And I'm holding your phones hostage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There is no plan in mind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think it's healthy to have phone radiation vagin. And one on my butt crack. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Here I am in my sweats. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look nice and comfy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't remember the last day my mom had a day off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, look who we got here. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait a minute. What are you guys doing here in your UGGs? &gt;&gt; NOELLE: To come over and have a girls' day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; LISA: Long time no see. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Me! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. I invited my mom's friends over to kind of keep her company. Otherwise I know that she would never just get rid of her phone if she had nothing going on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Come on, girls. I haven't even gotten to enjoy my new bar, ladies. &gt;&gt; LISA: Well, that's a must. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, ladies. Young. Cheers. &gt;&gt; LISA: Yay! &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yay. Come in here, girlfriend. &gt;&gt; LISA: I want to come sit... ow, right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I kind of like this doing nothing. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah, it's good. I like it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay! It kind of feels good to sit and talk to my girlfriends and have a moment to myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Start a fire... &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Hmm-mm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Didn't what? Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; NOELLE: See? You're never out here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't even know how to light the damn fireplace. Well, this is fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Gotta give your mind a little break. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to enjoy my life, and this just reminds me that I have to make time for everyone I love. And I miss just sit and just turn it off and have the other relationships suffer. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How about yourself? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who's this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I asked Kim to come over and help a little with my mom, and she shows up in another wig. Like, she's so crazy, I don't know what is going on with her. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim, you're not blond. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, what are you doing in a blond wig? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm from the South, and I'm blond. Just call me Britney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think we need to check Kim's mind into a institution, because I don't know what is going on with her. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys always say I have no fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Blondes do have more fun, now, don't they? &gt;&gt; KIM: Live a little! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yee-haw! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're starting to freak me out a little bit with these wigs. Are we having an identity crisis? Should I get really worried about you? &gt;&gt; KIM: It was just time for me to stop taking everything so seriously. So, I'm... &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's back! She's back! &gt;&gt; KIM: Why not? Who really cares? For all the drama and stress that I've been dealing with lately, I just feel like role playing and putting wigs on just kind of helped me get out of my funk. You want it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Woo-hoo! This is exactly what I need... to really relax. &gt;&gt; LISA: Now they can't find you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, my God, you... &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, you look kind of cute in blond. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, it's the new me! 778 00:34:59,837 --> 00:35:08,109 Gidget from San Diego. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have your phone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... You know what, it wasn't so bad not having this phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, didn't it feel good? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, kind of. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You'll survive. It's just an e-mail. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh... An e-mail? How about 300 e-mails? This is exactly why I should not have turned off my phone. I kind of... oh. You really hurt Bruce's feelings. And nothing hurts Bruce's feelings. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have no idea what you're doing. 793 00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:56,179 Kind of been there from the beginning. What do you want? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is exactly why I should not have turned off my phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sure you'll survive. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You got to know what's important. I do know what's important, but these, if you saw these chain of e-mails. This is why I cannot be off e-mail for this long. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that's why you live your life and you experience the moments. What happened in that time period where your phone was off where you were actually enjoying your time relaxing and hanging out that is gonna change your life? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because people need answers to things that are going on in the moment. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, that's why you have people that work for you. It doesn't have to be right away. That's life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right now I'm reading the e-mail chains, and everything seems to be taken care of, which is shocking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, 'cause you have people that help you out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a control freak. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So am I, but I also know... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And if you're a control freak, then I feel like I need to give everybody my input and give what my response might be. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not just about the phone. It's, just, you're rushing through life: you have road rage, you're cursing, you're not like, present in the moment. I just feel like, for example, the other day Rob said something that hurt Bruce's feelings at dinner, and, like, you normally would have picked up on that and noticed, 824 00:37:14,002 --> 00:37:18,539 and you didn't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did he say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. He just said how he had no father figure. And Bruce has been trying to help Rob find a place to buy a condo, and I just feel like it hurt Bruce's feelings, and it's your job to fix it and make it right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I obviously want to make it right. He's been the most amazing dad to you guys, and especially Rob. Rob was three years old when Bruce met him, and he's been a really powerful force in Rob's life and has helped mold Rob into the person that he is today. It's kind of hard to hear that Rob said something so upsetting to Bruce. And Bruce tried to reach out and talk to me about it, and I didn't even hear him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I know you'll fix the Rob-and-Bruce thing. I just wanted you to know. And I gots to go 'cause I have a family to spend time with. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to spend time with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can come over anytime... Ha! 843 00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:23,886 Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, Kourtney! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Mama! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob, I'm in the family room. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my beautiful mother. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Rob. You kind of look very European right now. I'm kind of digging your look. &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh... well, thanks, Mom. What did you call me over for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know this is hard to believe, but you really hurt Bruce's feelings. And nothing hurts Bruce's feelings, nothing. &gt;&gt; ROB: With what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: With a couple of the comments that you made to him about, you know, you grew up without a dad, that you didn't grow up with a role model. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, I had my friends and obviously my family. I didn't... &gt;&gt; KRIS: But you had Bruce. Bruce is the one who taught you how to ride a bike. &gt;&gt; ROB: Did he? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. He went to every single one of your track meets. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's true. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He did a lot of things for you that you don't remember because you were three years old. He didn't do it so that 20 years from now somebody would give him a gold medal. He's got one of those. He did it because he loved you. &gt;&gt; ROB: I didn't, clearly, I didn't mean it like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know you didn't. But I think that being a step-parent is a thankless job. Maybe Rob doesn't have these ever-present memories of Bruce being there when he was little because Robert was three years old when he met Bruce. And Bruce was there from that day in 1990 to this very day today. Let me have the clicker. I got to show you this video I found. &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, really fun stuff. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob's right out there in the lead. See in the back? I told him not to take the lead. He always wants to take the lead in the first lap. Don't take the lead. &gt;&gt; ROB: There I am. There I'm gone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There he is leading. Easy! Use your arms! &gt;&gt; ROB: I was such a good runner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just ran through the frame. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's the Robster holding on for third. Still got a lot of lap there, big guy. &gt;&gt; ROB: I need to watch these more often. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not bad! &gt;&gt; KRIS: See? It's kind of fun to reminisce and think about where you came from, isn't it? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. My mom's showing me all these videos is really making me realize, like, I was an idiot in saying what I said. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob, you had so many good times with each other. &gt;&gt; ROB: I do feel bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...when you guys were growing up and little. &gt;&gt; ROB: Bruce was there, obviously, my whole entire life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't that great? &gt;&gt; ROB: I am very appreciative and fortunate to have had him in my life. I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, too. Just appreciate what you have. &gt;&gt; ROB: I do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: It was just a misunderstanding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Well, let him know that so he doesn't have his feelings hurt. Bye, baby. That was fun. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yep. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; Rob: Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yo. &gt;&gt; ROB: One, two, three, four, five helicopters. Six. You want me, you want me to clean these for you? It's the least I can do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. You have no idea what you're doing. You'd hurt yourself. Leave all my stuff alone. What's on your mind? You're out here bugging me. What do you want? &gt;&gt; ROB: Um... &gt;&gt; ROB: You want me to clean these for you? It's the least I can do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. You have no idea what you're doing. You'd hurt yourself. Leave all my stuff alone. What's on your mind? Why are you bugging me? &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I just kind of, um, wanted to apologize. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Apologize for what? &gt;&gt; ROB: You thinking that I'm not appreciative of you when really I'm more than you even know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, when I heard you say, you know, that you don't have a role model after your dad passed away, it was, like, you know, I've kinda been there from the beginning. And I would like to think, you know, I would be a good role model for you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So when you hear that, it just kind of hurts. That's all. &gt;&gt; ROB: From a guy who, you know, took four kids when you married my mom, that alone says enough. And then staying with my mom in general, and then all of us. It's a big deal. I'm also sorry for being really, like, dismissive with you and not really taking your opinion on, you know, the housing situation. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, I have bought more houses than your mother. &gt;&gt; ROB: Have you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Ever since we've been married for the last 20 years, we've bought the same houses. Before that, she lived in the same house for years and years and years. Me, I've had so many houses. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, obviously, I respect your opinion and your decisions. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's just certain things that, I'm used to Mom's decision because I've just been raised by her doing things since day one. With Bruce in my life, he's like the perfect balance in our family 'cause my mom is a big-time spender, and Bruce is very conservative, so I figure with the two of them together. it kind of, like, balances my mindset on purchasing a home. Let's just take it slow. One of the houses, like, is awesome, but it's gonna need, like, a lot of work. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've done, I've done pretty much everything, that one house-- &gt;&gt; ROB: I know, you painted the whole house, the inside and the outside. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Painted the whole house inside, we did that.
