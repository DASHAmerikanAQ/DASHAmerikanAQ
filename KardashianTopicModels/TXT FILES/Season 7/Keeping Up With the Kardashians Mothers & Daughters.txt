- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Doll, yoga time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, all right. (Leila sings chant in foreign language) &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sounds like temple. &gt;&gt; LEILA: Kind of. Not really, though. It's about drawing in light and love. So this is a posture that helps to build trust and compassion. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is insane. For some reason, this is only building anger for me. &gt;&gt; LEILA: The space can handle it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's some space for it. &gt;&gt; LEILA: Yeah, this is to train the... ourselves to work past the mind. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm mindless. &gt;&gt; LEILA: Releasing fear, releasing any, um... anything that's no longer needed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not scared anymore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not scared anymore. &gt;&gt; LEILA: And exhale. Good. Into a child's pose. We're gonna come into some vagina yoga next. That's some... Kegel exercises. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you have any exercises? &gt;&gt; NICK: Ah, magic. Look at that. Absolute perfection. Beautiful. One, two, three. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your hair looks like such a bouffant right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, honey, 'cause it is. Call me Boo-boo Fay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna call MJ. &gt;&gt; MJ: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, MJ. &gt;&gt; MJ: Hi, Kim. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. How are you? What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: MJ is my Grandma Mary Jo. She lives in La Jolla, in San Diego, where my mom grew up. Every summer, we used to go down to San Diego and spend the summer with my grandma and my grandpa. It's just, like, ever since we've been, you know, just working so much, I feel like, it's, like, the less and less time we get to spend with her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, gorgeous, MJ. Kim really is crazy. She asked me the other day if I could come over and hold her while she fell asleep. She is. &gt;&gt; KIM: She thinks I'm gay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She is gay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why would you call me gay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim will come down 'cause she's... wants to cuddle with you one day, she just said. &gt;&gt; MJ: She wants to cuddle. Well, at least you made me laugh good today. You guys have fun. I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; MJ: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, she said she was home, so she didn't go to work today, so that means she's having, like, a bad day. When she had cancer, like, the radiation shrunk her intestines. Like, once a year, she had these, like, these crazy fits where she would be, like, throwing up all night and literally think she was gonna die. My grandmother survived breast cancer and colon cancer. Lately, she's been getting sicker and sicker as a result to her treatments years ago. So, I think it's really 57 00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:53,940 important that we all come to San Diego to visit my grandma and just make an effort. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's wrong, Kendall? Are you tired? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoops. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why is my phone so hot? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My phone is so hot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Cold and hot compress. So what's the plan for the rest of the afternoon? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. Why are you putting an ice pack on your head? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Daddy woke me up in the middle of the night. Bam! Right in the face... I mean, it's, like, I'm sleeping with a prizefighter. It's not funny. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's so funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not funny. Bruce wakes me up night after night after night. He goes to sleep, lies on his back and starts flinging his arms around. I'm run down. I need my sleep. This is exactly why Bruce is downstairs on the couch, and I'm upstairs in the bed. Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What hurts? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you feeling today, honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm fine. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? Did you have a good night's sleep? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. How about you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You beat the out of me in the middle of the night with your arm again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, don't... Don't use language like that in front of the kids. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Like we haven't heard it before. She said it all our lives. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, but it's just not right. It's just not right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And what did I do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Keep hitting me in the middle of the night again. Just when we had, like, the greatest couple of days. That's why I can't sleep in the same bed with you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so, we're just right back to square one. I can't do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just restless when I sleep. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But it's not normal for somebody to be like that when they're sleeping. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm a, uh, high-strung racehorse. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Huh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa! What's all this, Mase? Why is all your clothes out here? Mommy thinks that we should live like people in Oklahoma... or Minnesota. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; MARI: Hi. Nice to meet you, too. I'm Mari. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm excited. &gt;&gt; MARI: I know. Um, so, you're cool with being naked, right, for this whole thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; MARI: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: One of my friends, as an early baby shower gift, got me a cast of my belly so I could always have a mold of what my pregnant belly looked like. One of my best friends-- she's pregnant, too-- and she's thinking of doing a water birth at home, so I mean, I have, like, thought about that. &gt;&gt; MARI: Yeah, I specialize in water births. I've even seen an orgasmic birth with a... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. &gt;&gt; MARI: I'm sitting there, all of a sudden, she's pushing the baby out, and she starts going, "Yes! Yes!" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MARI: And I'm, like... I was embarrassed. I'm, like, "Really?" I'm, like... I'm not... I'm trying not to watch her. And you see the baby come out underwater, the face is up, she has this smile on her face. She kicks off her mom's perineum, into her dad's arms. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've been hearing of so many different ways that women are giving birth, and I just want to explore my options for this baby. &gt;&gt; MARI: Let's check it out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh. &gt;&gt; MARI: Tada! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, how cool. &gt;&gt; MARI: Look at that. That's beautiful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love that. 130 00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:11,338 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Looks like a porn movie in here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How beautiful is this back here, huh? Kris did a great job. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's pretty nice. This is really good. Do these just get sent to the house? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They come every day. Delivered, truck, 4:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You're up at that time. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I do get up. I was up at 5:00 this morning. I wake up, I'm ready to go. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love the mornings. But I still have this sleeping thing. I don't even know I'm doing it. I'm sound asleep. Doesn't even wake me up. My arms are flailing all over the place. Wakes her up. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Are you dreaming about, like, things in particular? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honestly, back in the old, old days when I was training-- I mean, I'd be dreaming about throwing the discus and stuff, and all of a sudden, I'd wake myself up, just, bam, when I was supposed to hit it. I was, like... I mean, I would go crazy at bed at night. I don't know if I'm just a restless sleeper, or nervous sleeper. I don't know what it is. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I really do think you should go try to see somebody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I... I just hate to go to doctors. It's, like, "Aah." &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Some of the documentaries I've seen that, you know, they set somebody up in a room, basically, and they watch you sleep. Then they can kind of diagnose what the disorder is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, it's just... It's caused so many problems. We've been working, you know, really hard on, you know, on our relationship. Everything's going good. You know, I don't want to, you know, be waking her up at night to screw the whole thing up, 'cause it's tough. It's not just that she woke up. I feel bad that I woke her up, and then in the morning, she's yawning and yelling and screaming. You know, everything's better if I just, like, sleep downstairs, you know? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You should do it. One night could fix many nights, you know? There's people that have, like, serious, serious sleep disorders. This isn't... 173 00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,243 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, big ones, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You got it easy. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Come here. Give me my money. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, no! Let me save him! Let me save him! My, Mason! My Mason! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah, I saved you. Run! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, Mommy can't run. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, Khloe and I and Kim are going to San Diego next week to see MJ, so do you want to come with us? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really can't go next week because I have so much going on. I mean, the reason I haven't gone in a while is 'cause I'm so fricking busy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's never gonna be a day when you have not one thing to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, it's your mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's never gonna be a day... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know how much... how you would give me so much crap if I didn't come and see you? I don't know why mom, you know, tries to push MJ away. Not to say that MJ is dying. But when my dad was dying, it was really hard for me to visually see that, see him throwing up. I couldn't deal with that. I feel like my mom is kind of doing that a little. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me try and see if I can rearrange, Kourt, okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, you can rearrange, so don't try and see. Make it happen, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you think about the girls' song? &gt;&gt; ANTONINA: I love it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you think, Vincent? &gt;&gt; KENNETH: The image... this is the image, that's the look. &gt;&gt; VINCENT: I love it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; VINCENT: I loved that showcase they did. &gt;&gt; ANTONINA: They need that record, that record that's going to stand out. &gt;&gt; KENNETH: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; ANTONINA: I mean, look at-- I have to say... Why don't you just let me get 209 00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:46,786 through this meeting, and I'll go home and check my schedule? Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; KENNETH: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's just getting older and she's a breast cancer and colon cancer survivor, and that was Kourtney, and she's like, "Mom, we need to go see MJ"-- we call her-- "and you're avoiding going." &gt;&gt; VINCENT: I can't talk about moms. I get emotional about it. &gt;&gt; KENNETH: I can't-- yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no. I've been traveling and working so much that I haven't had a chance to go down. She lives in San Diego. &gt;&gt; ANTONINA: You know, those are the things you'll regret forever. &gt;&gt; BECKY: You're feeling your baby come out. It's so empowering and raw. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is so freaking me out. I wish I had a panic room in this house. I'd go sit in it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm glad Mom's coming. It's hard for my mom to see her mom getting older, but that doesn't mean you should not have 228 00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:58,892 time for them or be there for them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mason. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mason. Come here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll go get it. &gt;&gt; MASON: I'll go get it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, how do I get out of here? &gt;&gt; MARTA: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. How are you? Good to see you. You look nice. Marta is an ayurvedic 238 00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:34,294 specialist. Um, this is Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now that I'm pregnant, I need special herbs for pregnancy, and she makes customized herbs for whatever your body needs at that time. Should I be taking ghee? &gt;&gt; MARTA: Yes, the last trimester is when the baby's brain is being formed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MARTA: So ghee is very good right now. Okay, let me see your pulse. I already recommend for after the baby is born, we come give you a massage and then we'll teach you how to do the massage on the baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My friend-- she's pregnant also. She might want to do it at home, do a water birth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I wanted to, like, look into it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Kourtney, that's... Oh, please, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; MARTA: As soon as you go in the water, basically the pain-- it just kind of subsides. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; MARTA: It's really, really nice, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; BECKY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi, come on in. &gt;&gt; LORRI: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Birth control's here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have invited the staff of a local birthing center over to the house. Doing an at-home birth sounds amazing. We can sit down in here. I've heard a lot about water births lately, and it's supposed to relieve the pain. I just wanted to get, like, more info on an at-home water birth with, like, the tub and... &gt;&gt; LORRI: We believe that this process is a normal function and that your body is designed to do it and that we should support you and love you both in doing this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What about how they say there's, like, risks and stuff of not doing it in the hospital? &gt;&gt; BECKY: We specialize-- like, our main thing is low-risk mamas and keeping you low-risk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can you get an epidural at home? &gt;&gt; LORRI: No, but being in water reduces your pain anywhere from 80-- like, 50 to 100% less pain. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LORRI: But we do have other things for pain management. &gt;&gt; BECKY: There is a lot of truth to making out and nipple stimulation to get the contractions going. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If I was like, "I need you to stimulate my breasts to get my labor going..." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Want me to grab your a little bit? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BECKY: The feeling of your baby, like, coming down. You're feeling your baby come out. It's so empowering and raw. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is so freaking me out. I wish I had a panic room in this house. I'd go sit in it. I don't want to be thinking that that kid's coming out of that little secret place that I'd like to go to when I'm lonely at night. I want to think of it as my little playground. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like the idea of everything minus the no epidural. &gt;&gt; LINDSEY: I had the same fears, though... This is my mom, and we work together, so she delivered my son. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's your real mom? &gt;&gt; LINDSEY: Yeah, and as long as I know there's an end and my baby and me are safe, I will be fine, I will get through this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, it is true. Like, you-- everybody will get through. &gt;&gt; LORRI: And if you ever say, "Screw this, I can't handle it, I need to go for drugs," we're-- we will. &gt;&gt; BECKY: We have enough safety equipment of a neonatal ambulance or of a level-one hospital, so there's-- everything comes to you at your house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll be honest. I thought this whole thing was a little bit crazy until I heard all this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It does make sense. I mean, if people could have kids in caves, you know, hundreds and hundreds of years ago, why not have it at your house? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: After meeting with these women, I'm definitely even more excited about the idea of a home birth, and the fact that Scott is so excited about it is, like, shocking that it makes me even wonder, like, wow, maybe what I should do. &gt;&gt; LORRI: You probably know what this is-- a Doppler to listen to the baby's heartbeat. Let's see. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Feel like I'm in school. That's a cool little tool. &gt;&gt; LORRI: When we get it right on the heart, there's four chambers to the heart, so it sounds kind of like horses running, a gallop. But do you want to feel, Scott? His back's over here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll give a little touch. &gt;&gt; LORRI: Yeah, let me show you. This side's kind of squishy. Oops, wait, here's a foot. &gt;&gt; BECKY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; LORRI: Is that cool? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, it's weird. The luxury of having the child at home does sound nice. Hello, you little baby. But I can't imagine all these leaking oils and placenta juices. That's kind of gross. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm all wired up. I'm a little nervous to see what the results are going to be. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely want to see this water birth. Does the water help with the pain? They said it could help, like, 80 to 100%. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you done with that, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Sure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So these girls came over to my house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What girls? For your orgy party? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not girls but women. This one woman, who is a midwife, has owned a birthing center for 17 years, and they help do at-home births. &gt;&gt; KIM: Aren't your sheets going to get ruined? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you buy cheap sheets or whatever sheets you don't care to ruin. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sign me up for the hospital, baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but, like, let me tell you something. To just say to everyone, "Everyone, come on over, we're coming to my house," and "Sit on the couch in my bedroom." And Mason could be in the room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are going to traumatize your son. &gt;&gt; KIM: He is going to be traumatized for life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's going to be like, "What's coming out of Mommy?" &gt;&gt; KIM: He's going to think you're getting murdered, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like it's empowering, like, to know that you can do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You were injected. You were numb from the waist down last time. Your vagina was ice cold. You don't remember any pain. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, what are they gonna do with the placenta. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God forbid something happens. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can have an ambulance waiting outside. They said, the girl said in 27 years of her doing this she's called an ambulance six times. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's due for a call. It's like there hasn't been a plane crash in 42 years... you're plane's gonna crash. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do value my sisters' opinions, and my mom's opinion. I think ultimately it's my decision, and I don't want to be stupid and make a bad choice. So that's why I do want to make sure I'm doing all my research. I mean, I am scared of the pain, but I don't take medicine in my life... I don't take Tylenol, I don't take Advil... &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you get an epidural? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that's what I'm saying. You can't, but they relax you. They say that, because you do, they bring the tub... &gt;&gt; KIM: You are crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...in your room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Boys and girls... &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? I got you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The bus to San Diego is leaving. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll be in the car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom put up a little fight with wanting to come down to San Diego, but my sisters and I finally convinced her. MJ's alone in San Diego. And I'm sure MJ is sad and wants 381 00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,757 to see all of us. &gt;&gt; MASON: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ready, set, go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm glad Mom's coming, but she should make more time to come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's hard when your parents get older, I'm sure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's probably hard for my mom to see her mom getting older, but that doesn't mean you should not have time for them, or be there for them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're here. We're at GG's house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's been a couple of years since I've been down to San Diego and La Jolla to visit my mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I tend to push the people away that I love the most when I feel like there's nothing I can do about a situation. And it's a little painful because she's been losing a lot of weight and nobody seems to be able to tell her why. I'm afraid to face the fact that things aren't always gonna stay the same. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If I, like, wet the bed, will I electrocute myself or something? &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: No, no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, okay, good. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You'll be all good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got my clicker. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'll see you tomorrow. Get a good night's sleep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think you ever give MJ the opportunity to tell you that's she's hurting. What if your mother were to, God forbid, pass away? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And that's what scares 407 00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,637 me. How would you feel if I wasn't here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Hi, Mom, look at you. &gt;&gt; MJ: I'm so glad to see you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He just woke up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, it's been so long since you've been here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The house looks great, Mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: So cute. &gt;&gt; MJ: Well, thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really, really, really good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, it looks great here. This is the room that mom and Kiki used to sleep in. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, look at this photo. Look, that's Mom when she was a baby. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that her? &gt;&gt; MJ: No, that's my mother. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's what I thought. I was gonna say she looks just like Grandma. &gt;&gt; MJ: That's her mother. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; MJ: And she was real pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who's that? &gt;&gt; MJ: That's me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; MJ: Look at Kris over here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The house that MJ is living in now is actually my great grandmother's house. I think for all of us, we have different memories to share at the house. My mom obviously has a lot more because she stayed there as a kid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've got boxes from, like, 1922. You could probably get rid of that right now. &gt;&gt; MJ: It has your grandmother's initials, and I was saving it for you. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aye, aye, matey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's really crazy. &gt;&gt; MASON: I see one more rock. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Seeing Mason run around my mom's house reminded me of many, many years ago when it was Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloe, Rob, and it's exactly the same as I remember. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should do this once a month, Khloe and I said. It's two hours away. What do you care? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I'm on the freeway that much sometimes during a regular day anyway. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, but you should come. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And look, this is a lot of work to keep a house like this up. I think living in L.A. sometimes allows me to put my head in the sand, and not really deal with the reality of my mom being by herself, not always feeling 100%. But watching my mom today walk through her house and just talk about old times makes me realize how fast 453 00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:30,549 it goes by. And I really, truly am so happy that we all came down here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's put it on our cart. My family and I are checking into a hotel right next to MJ's house. Rob had an appearance in Vegas, and meeting us in San Diego. Kim, we're Laverne and Shirley. Bye, Laverne. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye, Shirl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, Rob, oh, we could play Hansel and-- no, Rapunzel. I see you right there. Come on, I have champagne. Come here. Let's getup and see what happens. How did you do that? &gt;&gt; ROB: Who's looking? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't know white men could jump. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm gonna jump. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, go talk to the seagull right now. Robert, run and jump up here Â Bourne Identity. &gt;&gt; ROB: As long as I get a hold of the rail I'll be good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Sally, shut the up. If this is what you're gonna do 472 00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:32,311 all day, I'm gonna take you out. Rob will hit you. I hate you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey, Bruiser. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There he is. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What's going on in here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm watching the last minute of the game. How you doing? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You're just trying to stall? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm stalling. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Trying to get out of this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm trying to get tired. At Brandon's suggestion, I decided to look into a sleep clinic. Kris and I have 21 years invested in this relationship. Maybe it's the right thing to do. Kendall and Kylie are staying at their friend's house. It's a perfect night to sneak out of the house, get wired up, and let's just see what the results are. Oh, get that last white rice in there, all that starch. 489 00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:15,454 Let's get this over with. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Khloe, Khloe, can I get an picture? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I use that? Thank you. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's a shame how good-looking I am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you ever feel like maybe MJ is a little too thin? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's had colon cancer and breast cancer... and had radiation for both. So I don't think it's fair that you call that a little too thin. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think she suffers and she doesn't tell us how much she's hurting. &gt;&gt; ROB: Who? &gt;&gt; KRIS: MJ. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I 100% agree with you, but I don't think you ever give MJ the opportunity to tell you that she's hurting. What if your mother were to, God forbid, pass away? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And that's what scares me, Khloe. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom. Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: How would you feel if I wasn't here? You don't understand that I don't know how to live without my mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But why don't you tell her that? Stop telling me. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom, Mom... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because you know how much she wants to hear that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think I can ever allow myself to accept the fact that one day my mom won't be here, and it makes me kind of emotional. I just get too busy and caught up in my own life, but I don't ever want that to happen again. What makes me sad, Khloe, is that she's not gonna be here forever. And that's something that we all realize. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The best thing about life is knowing you're not gonna be here forever. You know why? 519 00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:46,311 Because it makes you live that even more... free. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Let's do this. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Sure I can't carry that for you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I think I got it. It's a pretty big bag for just a toothbrush. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I know. This is where you'll be staying the night. &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: So tonight, we're gonna have you see a video to prep you on what you're looking for... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And then sleep. &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a really tough assignment. &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: Yeah, well, we're also going to be putting electrodes. We're gonna be putting about 20 electrodes... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: ...on your face, head and your body, okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Great. 535 00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,712 &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: Not too bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, right. Okay. &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: Yeah. Place these two electrodes through your shirt and then through your pants all the way to your ankle down one leg. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is probably the most exciting thing that's happened yet. &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: So you don't snore? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: You breathe through your nose well? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: You have any blockage at all? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I don't. This... is ridiculous. Honestly, I have no idea-- with things sticking up my nose and stuff over my mouth and wires everywhere-- how I'm ever gonna get a good night's sleep. How the hell am I supposed to brush my teeth? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's a good point. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If I, like, wet the bed, will I electrocute myself or something? &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: No, no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Okay, good. Thanks. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'd hug you, but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I needed the support. I don't want to get you electrocuted. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You'll be all good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got my clicker. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'll see you tomorrow. Get a good night's sleep. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, well, thank you. Thank you. I really do appreciate this, Brandon. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, absolutely. Somebody's got to take you. &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: Oh, Mr. Jenner, now you're gonna hear me overhead in about a minute to make sure everything's working properly. After that, you can go ahead and sleep, all right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Perfect. &gt;&gt; TECHNICIAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I really want to do the right thing with my wife, so I'm here, I'm doing this, 567 00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:37,322 I'm all wired up. I'm a little nervous to see what the results are going to be. &gt;&gt; MAN: First time here at the zoo? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We've been coming since we were little girls. &gt;&gt; MAN: Awesome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Today, I get to take MJ to the San Diego Zoo, and it's very significant to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Give him a kiss, Mase. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have so many memories and happy times tied up with the San Diego Zoo. I had my birthday party there, and my mom being healthy enough to do something like this-- it's a big deal. &gt;&gt; MAN: You know what? You're holding a tiger. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: I can show you a tiger really, really close. Would you like to see a tiger? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want to see a tiger? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: Let's go see some tigers. &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yay! &gt;&gt; MJ: Yay. &gt;&gt; MASON: What's that noise? What is he saying? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's saying, "Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yum." You want to go closer? &gt;&gt; MASON: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No? &gt;&gt; MASON: Bye, tiger. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So cute, right, Mom? &gt;&gt; MJ: Right. They're adorable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at the mama over there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How old was I the first time you ever took me to the zoo? &gt;&gt; MJ: Probably your first birthday. They had parties here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; MJ: And I got in for 50 cents, and all you guys were free. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're a really good mom. I like that. &gt;&gt; MJ: Well, it was pretty cheap. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 50 cents?! Who knew I was such a cheap date? Not only did I appreciate today, It makes me appreciate what you did for me. 50 years ago, Mom. &gt;&gt; MJ: 49, honey. 49. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Poor little helicopter's all dusty. Poor baby. Hello. &gt;&gt; DR. SHOEMAN: Uh, hello. I'm trying to reach Mr. Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's me. &gt;&gt; DR. SHOEMAN: Hi. This is Dr. Shoeman calling, uh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How did I do? &gt;&gt; DR. SHOEMAN: Uh, you did well, but we did notice, exclusively in the REM stage of sleep, was that you did have these sort of complex movements with your hand. Sometimes things that you do when you're awake leak over into when you're sleeping, and they're not supposed to, and so, I think this is the case here. What I'd like to suggest is the EG, which is an electroencephalogram, where we look at the brain's electrical activity in a much more detailed fashion than we have on the sleep study. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cool. All right. &gt;&gt; DR. SHOEMAN: Then we can go from there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. Thanks for the call. &gt;&gt; DR. SHOEMAN: My pleasure, sir. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. I feel, actually, guilty that I don't come down here more. &gt;&gt; MJ: I know you're totally busy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, but you know what? I think I've realized just by being on this trip that it doesn't matter how busy you are. We don't know how much time we have left, and I want to enjoy every single day I have with you. &gt;&gt; MJ: Yay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do. &gt;&gt; MJ: That makes me so happy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Makes me appreciate you more, Mary Jo. &gt;&gt; MJ: So we have to grab the day, right? Seize the day. Stop it. Stop it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think what I've realized about this whole trip to San Diego is that time is not gonna stand still for me, or for any of us, and we have to savor each and every moment that we can. I'm not gonna make the same mistake that I've made for the last two years. I want to see my mom as much as possible. I'm gonna really make the effort. I want you to be happy, and I'm happy when I'm here with you. I feel bad we don't live in the same city. &gt;&gt; KIM: So what she's saying is, she wants to come visit you more often. &gt;&gt; MJ: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Pinky swear. &gt;&gt; MJ AND KRIS: Pinky swear. &gt;&gt; MJ: Pinky swear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, Mom. &gt;&gt; MJ: I love you, Kris. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! All right, I got to talk to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. What's up? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm trying to get to the bottom of the old sleep thing, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...I went to a sleep doctor. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You went to a sleep doctor? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When did you go to a sleep doctor that I didn't know about? 657 00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:01,553 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When you were down in San Diego, and I actually spent the night there. So the doctor just... Doctor called, so the bottom line is, I do it in my REM sleep. It's not terribly bad. It seems to be my left arm. He could do more tests. I don't know if I need to do that, 'cause I don't think there's anything at the end you can do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: At least somebody else... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I'm looking into it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...saw what I had to live with. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want you to know that I'm trying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. Okay, good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I'm trying to get to the bottom of the problem, but anyway... &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, I'm trying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, thanks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. 673 00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:38,123 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm with Kourtney at the Toto showroom today, because she is getting new toilets for her house. I'm just here for moral support. You cannot say no to a pregnant person. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love those toilets. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, this is the expensive one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The big shebang. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, "Hello!" Is this the kind of tub they use for a water birth? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, your whole vagina. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good thing no one can see me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think I'm gonna fit in here. Your wholeis out. I don't see your &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, I'm trying to cover it up. There. Is that better? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Much. &gt;&gt; PAUL: How does it feel? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Comfortable. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Room for two. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is comfortable. &gt;&gt; PAUL: 72 inches. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And we were seeing if it would be good to give birth in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my gosh. No. That was her idea, not mine. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Uh... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you're on call for the water birth? We're on call. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney has been on this kick about the water birth. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need you to be ready to go at any moment, 'cause I do not want to see it alone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know how the hell this works, but she, you know, had four different women that were willing to let her view a water birth at their house. Three of the women went into labor at times that we either were out of town, this... whatever. I don't think she understands what a real home birth is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You go into the hospital, you get shot in your back, you feel numb from the waist down, and you pop that sucker out. That's what you do. I don't understand, what's the change of plan? People can die at birth. I don't know, could she become paralyzed? I have no idea. I'm like, "Who is here to help you if something goes wrong?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just saying, there's options. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Help me, help me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have never heard anything like this, I have never seen anything like this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For God's sakes, Kim, you need to take-- go to cooking school. Yes, but cook them and then see what the color is when it all comes together. You'll be fine. Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, for the love of Kanye. Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think I've solved the flailing arm problem and I'm back in bed with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you have on your arm? This is the sexiest thing I've ever seen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, it's my left arm, it's the same arm-- does it all the time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you're a freak. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, see, it's going to work. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, okay, okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm telling you. You know, in the middle of the night, I won't be able to go... you know, with the stupid arm. Did you brush your teeth, by the way? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not kissing anybody who has this freakazoid thing. Stop. Bruce, no, no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The birthing center has found a woman who will let Khloe and I come witness a water birth at her home. Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm forcing Khloe to come with me because there's no way I'm going alone, but I definitely want to see this water birth for myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, were you guys both for a home birth, or were you more nervous or do you not care? &gt;&gt; MAN: I was absolutely skeptical. I'm still nervous, I still don't know what I'm up against. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. No one else would go with Kourtney. She really wanted to witness this birth. Personally I don't want to witness this. I am very uncomfortable with the fact that this is a complete stranger. Like, I just-- it's very awkward to me. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: He just kept telling me the entire time, he's like, "This is your body, this is your experience, this is your birth, like, what you want to do." He goes, "But I'm not 100%." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This whole at-home birthing experience seems amazing. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You're gonna be just fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The woman is, like, happy, bouncing on a bouncy ball, like, watching TV, eating potato chips. It seems like a really great idea. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What should I do? Yeah. &gt;&gt; LORRI: It's-- so it's going to a more intense level now because we leaked the water. She kind of jokingly said, "Game's on" after we did that. &gt;&gt; BECKY: Yeah, she's so cute. She looked up at me and she goes, "Game's on. You weren't kidding." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BECKY: So it's normal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The sexual moaning just starts. &gt;&gt; LORRI: You know, it's-- that's a coping mechanism, you know. &gt;&gt; BECKY: Like the tennis players that, like, go, "Ha," you know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom makes, like, a grunting noise like I have never heard, which makes me not want to see her in any other circum-- 773 00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:05,817 like, position. &gt;&gt; LORRI: That might come out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I don't know what the hell to do. I just start cleaning. Kourtney is, like, right, front, dead center of this woman's , and it is just very uncomfortable for me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does the water help with the pain? Well, 'cause they said it could help, like, 80 to 100%. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, Oh,, oh,, oh, , oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BECKY: There you go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just very intense and scary. 787 00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:10,682 Those screams of pain are terrifying. &gt;&gt; LORRI: Beautiful. &gt;&gt; BECKY: Awesome. &gt;&gt; LORRI: Push. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Torturous screams that, like, will stay with me for the rest of my life. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Ow, my leg, ow, my leg. Oh, now it's, like, all the way down my leg. Oh, &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have witnessed Kendall, Kylie and Mason all being born. My mom never screamed, Kourtney never screamed. I have never heard anything like this, I have never seen anything like this. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Help me, help me. It hurts. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BECKY: Push through the pain. Push... It's gonna be here and it's gonna subside. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: And I don't-- the leg is making me scared. &gt;&gt; LORRI: Just breathe right now, just you don't have to push. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've never had a baby, but this is not normal. I don't know if I could want to see Kourtney in this kind of pain. &gt;&gt; LORRI: Do you want to try to push and see if you can get it past...? &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh, my God. That is amazing. &gt;&gt; BECKY: It's very good. Good, good, good. Now, I want you to reach down. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, God, oh! Oh, God, we did it. Oh, we did it, Jeff, oh, we did it. Oh, sweetie, oh, honey, we did it. Oh. 817 00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:30,121 Oh, baby, we did it, sweetie. Oh. Oh, we did it, yay. Oh, I can't wait for your sister to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's probably not the best idea to go witness someone else giving birth while so heavily pregnant, but once the baby's there, I think you forget about the pain. It's just such a rewarding feeling. That was crazy. Are you glad you did it at home? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God, what did I do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is so sweet, it's so cute. Definitely this is the point of giving birth and going through all this, but still I can't forget everything else that I 830 00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:16,167 just endured. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. All righty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you so tired? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tired doesn't even express it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like it must suck to be pregnant when it's this hot outside. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know, in a water birth the water temperature is, like, 100 degrees? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who wants to be sweating in a bathtub? Like, what's the point of taking a bath? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wish that you could kind of have the best of both worlds. I just don't think that a water birth is what I want to do now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know, I just feel like, even though I think the experience at home would be so amazing, when it's, like, your child's life that's involved, I just don't think I would take that risk. After witnessing this amazing water birth, I have decided that it's not for me. I just know how peaceful my birth experience was that I don't want to change it for the world. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Be at the hospital in case of an emergency. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I agree. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your boobs are mighty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just you wait. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ha-ha. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have a present for you. &gt;&gt; MASON: A fishy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One of the fish... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been thinking we should plan my funeral. I think it's a great idea to make sure everything's in place. 858 00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:44,055 Then, nobody has to worry about what to do. Could I lay in it?
