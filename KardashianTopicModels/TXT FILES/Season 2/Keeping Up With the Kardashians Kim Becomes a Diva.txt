- &gt;&gt; KIM KARDASSIAN: Oh, my God, guys, listen up. I have an announcement to make. Did you guys know that I'm, like, the number one Google search last week? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, shut up. You're so into yourself. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then yesterday I was the top AOL search for the whole week. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you also know that you are the number two on the dumbest people? from the <i>New York</i> Post? &gt;&gt; KIM: As long as they're talking about me, honey. Is there a manicurist on the set tomorrow for <i>Bongo?</i> I really have no time to get him a manicure &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "I have a soda shoot tomorrow." "I need a golden egg, Dadsy. Dadsy, I want it now!" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes I just don't know how I got stuck in this horror movie. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kimberly's gotta learn how to deal with this thing called "fame." The world doesn't revolve around her. She may <i>think it does...</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: You're gonna make me nauseous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who cares?! &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, honestly, my makeup is running down my face! Stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think you're getting a little full of yourself, sugar. You know why she's the most Googled person? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm. &gt;&gt; 'Cause she's Googling herself. &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. ♫ You are the girl of my dreams... ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm finally at a really happy place in my life right now. Everything from career to family is going perfect. Every night it's a different red carpet event, a different photo shoot. There's paparazzi everywhere I go now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We've been doing a lot more together as sisters. Oh, my God. They totally enlarged my boob. &gt;&gt; You could tell, they did. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've, you know, been dating somebody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Santa and Reginald! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim is dating Reggie Bush. They're really happy and serious about each other. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim really misses Reggie, 'cause he's always on the road, training and he just is super, super busy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I think it's great that she's really, really happy. &gt;&gt; Bye, Reggie! Bye, tight-ass! &gt;&gt; Tight-end. Tight-end. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It looks like <i>two of my</i> girls have found true love. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scotty is back. We get another guy in the house, which is great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scotty, I made you a burger with no cheese. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I hear you're lactose-intolerant. I didn't know that. Would that be like an imperfection in the gene pool here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, but everything else I look good, so it's fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott and I have been together for a year now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you. Everything's going really well. I haven't been able to open up with a guy since my high school boyfriend, and it's like the first time that I <i>am being</i> really honest and affectionate. I think that we're doing really good. Have fun, <i>dolce.</i> &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just feel like you guys have no idea what I'm going through. You have no idea... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you become so, like, up your own ass that you won't even...? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not up own my ass-- I'm just really busy doing stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I have to go meet Scott because I have his old phone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, you have his old phone? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's like his phone from four months ago. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you gone through it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not a spy like you psychopaths. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, but I am. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not a spy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Give me his phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, what is the point of this? &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean, what is the point of this? You want to know what your boyfriend's up to. I am queen of 007. I could break into any phone. I can get any code, any... Hear any voicemail. I know how to do it all. Wait. It says "Kyra... Model." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What?! Let me see. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so funny when guys write in codes. I'm like the Queen of codes. And that's a Miami phone number. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Miami number. Ooh. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's "law". What is "law"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That means... He has a text message from somebody called "my wife." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And it says, "I loved looking into your eyes last night." And then she said, "Yes, it was great seeing you." This is when he was in the Hamptons. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hold on. Then he wrote to his loser friend... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "I wish I could come to L. A. for a week and not tell Kourt, but the second we go out, she'll know I'm in town." I cannot believe Scott could have cheated on me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sorry, Kourt, that is not okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sick to my stomach that this... could have even happened. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's a bull and you do not need that in your life. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like he's one person when he's with you and he's another person when he's not with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I just would never let someone treat me like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just really do not know what to do. I think whenever I'm in, like, a crazy emotional situation, I definitely do rely on my sisters for guidance and support and just what to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need to break up with him. I think you should say something to him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So who is Kira and why are you staring into people's eyes? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you talking about? Kira who and staring into whose eyes? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you tell me who Kira is? Tell me all about her. I'd love to know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: About what? I don't even know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Unless you're gonna be honest, I have no reason to talk to you again. Okay, gotta go. Just call me when you want to be honest. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Huh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so disgusted and sick right now, I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you okay to drive and everything? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, I just need to go home and literally go to bed and never talk to losers like this again or associate them in my life. I have read every single thing in your phone. Who's your wife? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really can't stop thinking about this whole Scott situation. The quotes of the phone keep popping up in my head, and I just really can't stop thinking about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I'm gonna put this in the mailbox. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But the last thing I need is another annoying person like my mom to get involved, so this is just between Kim, Khloe, and I. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, jewel. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, jewel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We wanted to know if you wanted to go to lunch with us. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you okay? How are you feeling about Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just trying to keep busy and not think about it, but I just have so much to do, so I'm going to have to pass. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, Kim and I will go eat for you like we normally do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Poor little Kourtney is sad and depressed. Cheer up, Charlie. I don't know if she needs some alone time, if she's just tired. I'm kind of concerned. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like we should do something to cheer her up, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like what? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like go on a girls' trip. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, that would be so fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's like close? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean Cabo's the easiest place. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's relaxing. She can totally get her mind off of Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Out of the country so he can't call. &gt;&gt; KIM: The phone won't work. Oh, my God, that's perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's going to be amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like if we left it up to Kourtney, Kourtney would sit in her room all weekend contemplating and thinking about Scott. So Kim and I come up with the best idea-- to take Kourtney to Mi Cabo in Cabo San Lucas. No Scott allowed. ♫♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you guys doing? We're in Cabo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Vacations are relaxing. They don't always have to be... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...a bit fiesta. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not saying we got to party. Let's go do things we wouldn't normally do at home. This is your trip, let's go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Cheers, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've got it. Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Kim. How you doing? How's it going down there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, my hotel situation in Miami is all screwed up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A few weeks ago, Kim asked me to book her a room in Miami for an upcoming event. But it's been so difficult trying to get get exactly what she wants. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I'm not going if I'm not having a suite at the Setai. I want the $2,500 room-- the best room that they have. The couple bedroom suite. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The particular suite that you requested has been booked for a year. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't care. They need to get that room. That room needs to magically become available for me, because I've asked for it for a month ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're asking all these things, and you have all these requests and I'm trying to do my best to get done what you really want. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to stay in a piece ofhotel. Like everything you've booked me in Miami, has been the worst hotel ever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you should really check your attitude. You know, she can holler at me or raise her voice or get angry-- I understand she's frustrated-- but don't be a spoiled brat, because this is how life is. It's not all perfection. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's so annoying. I don't think it's asking for too much to stay in a nice hotel in a suite. Thank goodness I'm not asking for a private plane. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, she can't get this attitude stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're on her team. You know, we're just trying to make her life, you know, cushy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, what are you doing? Are you texting Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's nice to be away, and it's gorgeous in Cabo, but I really can't stop thinking about Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I leave you alone for five minutes and look at you. You're no longer allowed to have your phone. Come on, chip-chop. How do you think that guest bedroom's going to work out tonight? Come in handy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, you know that's not my style. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You never know what happens in Cabo, honey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe keeps trying to push me into hooking up with a guy tonight in Cabo. And that is not where my head is at at all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at Fabio. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That could be your one-night stand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's Fabio. ♫♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and Khloe, you know, they're trying to get me to drink and have fun and dance all night long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think we're having a lot of fun. And the next moment I realize Kourtney's gone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I could drink and dance for a little while, but I just can't stop thinking about this. I'm just ready to go home and deal with the situation. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just called and got the same suite for $1,700 in the three nights I'm going to be there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You keep going on and on about this room. The problem is... &gt;&gt; KIM: I have it handled. Thanks. Um, all right, what am I going to eat? I'm starving. All I have is a frickin' orange. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And look at how gorgeous these pears are. These are like Asian pears. They're fabulous. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're gorgeous and they taste like crap. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going to kill her if this attitude continues. &gt;&gt; Four new voice messages. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He called you? When was that, when we were out of town? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; Message has been deleted. New message. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you joking? &gt;&gt; New message. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sorry, he knows he's wrong. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's suddenly freaking out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's why he's calling you four times. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, but Khloe, I'd rather him calling me. If he wasn't calling me, I would be like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I understand you want closure-- and that's one thing, but... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hold on, this is him calling me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't answer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to answer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? Don't answer the phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know, I just want... I just want to get this over with. I'm an adult, and if I choose that I want to talk to Scott, I can do that. And Khloe needs to be supportive of whatever I decide. Hello. I mean, I have things I'd like to get off my chest and say to you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, I said I just want for my own self-- I'm not like doing him a favor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is such a bad idea. I'm really frustrated that Kourtney's about to go talk to Scott. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're such an idiot. Look, 'cause I know he's going to make up an excuse to get back in her life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to know what happened. And I want an explanation. This is not going to be a pleasant conversation. I read every single thing in your phone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Anything that you think that was bad, I can explain everything about. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who's your "wife" that's in your phone? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Some girl that, like, I dated in, like, high school. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why were you looking into my wife's eyes? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She came over to the house, and as a joke, we, like, looked into each other's eyes. We were like, "Oh, yeah, good to see you." And then over text message, it was back before like, "Oh, so good to look in your eyes." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, well, that's inappropriate. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're right. That was just me being immature and just being stupid. Even talking and flirting with other girls is disrespectful to you. But in no way was that really what I meant. I just always had that image that I thought it was like cool to act like you want to hang out with your guy friends and go out and party. But I do swear to God to you, I never cheated on you ever. I don't know exactly how to try to start over, but I'm going to make a change. You'll see. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really deep down inside, I don't feel like I'm done with the relationship, so I decide to give it a chance, but really slowly and definitely not jump in with both feet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I still love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, well, I can't, definitely can't give you all of me right now, so... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All I ask is, you just keep a somewhat open mind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do her pose that she always does. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm Kim Kardashian. I am fabulous and I am the best and everyone does what I say, and soon, I'll be the queen of the world! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're my favorite daughter. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks, Mom, for the shopping spree. Now I just need my $5,000 hotel. I can't stay in a crappy hotel, Mom. This is Busha, okay? Since we're going on red carpet, and I have to get my hotel, I need to shop till we drop, okay, Mom? &gt;&gt; KIM: They're totally in there making fun of me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're, like, imitating me, making fun of me. I overheard them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, maybe they're watching you and just kind of mimicking what you're doing. You know, the old Charles Barkley line: "Hey, I am no role model." Well, wrong. You are. Especially to these kids. They look up to you. You're their big sister. You just gotta keep the whole thing in proper perspective. Don't let anything go to your head. Just stay nice. Be nice to everybody, including your mother. You know, you just cannot act that way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Please, come here. You're gonna die. Scott wants to take me out to dinner tonight, but I want you to come with me. And, like, he needs to explain himself to you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not going and you're not going. I'm sorry. He's conned his way back into your life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, you can't make make all the decisions for How many times have you been there for Kim and her lunatic decisions? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, then I will go because I get it. But I still, I can't keep my mouth shut. That wouldn't be me. Are you gonna invite Kim? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I didn't even talk to her. She's too caught up in her own business. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When you hurt Kourtney, you hurt me. You do it twice, I will cut your balls off. <i>Capisce?</i> &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is calling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Put it on speaker. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Kourt. I just wanted to say that I know that you're going through a lot with Scott, and I haven't really taken the time to listen to your problems. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, speaking of her problems, guess where Kourt and I are going tonight? &gt;&gt; KIM: Where? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To dinner with Scott. &gt;&gt; KIM: No! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you going, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm making her come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I am the strong one in the family. &gt;&gt; KIM: You invite me! &gt;&gt; BOTH: 'Cause we haven't talked to you! &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, you guys. I want to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine. Pick us up at my house. And don't worry about being a diva. We love you anyway, honey. We're sistas. Sistas stick together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. Does he know we're coming? No way! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's probably terrified. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think I feel really, really positive about the decision to give Scott another chance. But I really need the support of my sisters, or else this won't work. Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I get three for the price of one being mad at me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, no, three for the price of three. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You look like you're in a hit man attire. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't know what I have on under this coat, buddy. Kourtney may have forgiven Scott, but he's not getting off that easily with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you gazing into our eyes? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: <i>Oy. First off, I</i> understand where I was wrong and immature and disrespectful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But the actual things that you think that are concrete are completely false. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would you page your friend saying, "I wish you would've come to L.A. without telling Kourtney so I could hang out with you"? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't make an excuse for me being pathetically immature and retarded to talk that much, to try to act cool for my guy friends. &gt;&gt; KIM: It does take a lot for a guy to admit that he's immature. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I understand it does. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...when being in love is like way cooler. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why do you think he's saying this right now? Because he's in the doghouse. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Khloe and I know what these crazy relationships are like. Thank goodness Reggie and I don't have the need to be psycho like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So what are your intentions with Kourt? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whatever it takes till whenever it takes is what I'm gonna do to try to be with her. So, obviously, I'd like to say more to you, but you got the bodyguard over here. Unfortunately, I have to go to the bathroom, and I know it's only gonna be downhill talking when I leave. Thanks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to be an idiot, but I'm crazy about him. I just feel like I need your support, though, and you can't have, like, an attitude every time Scott's there or it's gonna just make it really annoying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...tonight, but I'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's nice to know that I can make decisions on my own. But it's great to have the support of my sisters, whatever I decide. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to go to the restroom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whatever goes on between you and Kourtney is really between you and Kourtney, but when you hurt Kourtney, you hurt me. And you canher over once, and if she accepts it, cool. If you do it twice, I will cut yourballs off. <i>Capisce?</i> &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're cooking? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yes, I am. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my gosh, this is great. What are you cooking? &gt;&gt; KIM: Some French toast. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Making you guys breakfast. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is she making breakfast? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because I just feel bad. I've been really rude to everyone lately. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have. I'm surprised you're not at home checking your Google alerts. &gt;&gt; KIM: Guys, don't push your luck. I was here to say I'm sorry. I love you. I'm making you breakfast. If you guys want to help me... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, what a sweet girl you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: and YOU Girls, I'm here to also tell you to stop making fun of me. I saw you guys. I think I've learned that no matter how stressful and crazy things get, you can never treat people the way that you don't want to be treated. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I have mine over well? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, please. And my bacon kind of crispy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim's first apology ever! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In her whole 27 years of life. <i>This seson on "Keeping Up with The Kardashians"</i> Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is so cute. &gt;&gt; So cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to start eating healthy. &gt;&gt; What about having your own coop? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come here. Wouldn't it be great to have somebody totally dress you? &gt;&gt; You may be a little uncomfortable. I need to get the inseam of your pants. I don't mind going down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're going on a date! We're going on a date! &gt;&gt; KIM: It's sexual. It makes people want to rip your clothes off. &gt;&gt; I got a girlfriend now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, you're in love? Hey, babe. I miss you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, stop! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm picking you up and throwing you down! &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie is doing this celebrity pool tournament in New Orleans. &gt;&gt; We're gonna go rob them and teach them a lesson. &gt;&gt; It's like putting a miniature Jimmy hat on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe! Ew! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you look like a 12-year-old hooker in that dress. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't berude! I'llhurt you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get off that car! Get off that car! Just get out. Go! &gt;&gt; KIM: You're sitting there laughing. It's not funny!
