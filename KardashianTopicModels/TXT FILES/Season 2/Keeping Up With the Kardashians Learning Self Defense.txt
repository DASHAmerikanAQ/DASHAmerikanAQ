- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, doll. &gt;&gt; LILY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's going on? What?! Are you okay? I get a phone call from Lily that some really creepy guy is trying to vandalize the store and is cursing at Lily and harassing her. Okay, I'm coming over there right now. &gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is crazy. What happened in here? &gt;&gt; Well, he came in, and I was just folding things. And he came in, he was, like, "I need a dress." I'm, like, I don't know if he really needed one or not. And he was just like walking really fast, went over there, grabbed some things, he ripped a shirt, I'm totally freaking out... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that his drink? &gt;&gt; Yeah. He finally came over here, he was playing with the mannequin. I told him to drop the mannequin, to leave it alone. I told him to get out. And then he threw that at me and just ran out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He threw it at you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was just so crazy, I don't even know what to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, this is not okay. Don't touch anything 'cause we're gonna call the police. It's really frightening just to know that someone's in your store vandalizing it. What if he would have hurt Lily? &gt;&gt; DISPATCHER: 911. What is your emergency?. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, um, I own a clothing store, and it was just vandalized. &gt;&gt; DISPATCHER: This just occur? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. We'll send somebody out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. We're gonna be here. Thank you. They're sending someone here. They should be here in a minute. I'm so sorry this happened to you. Oh... I feel so bad. &gt;&gt; OFFICER: Hi. Okay, you know the person? &gt;&gt; LILY: No. &gt;&gt; OFFICER: All right. Gray sweatshirt, baseball cap... &gt;&gt; LILY: Wearing a gray sweatshirt, totally casual, um... &gt;&gt; OFFICER: What color is the backpack? &gt;&gt; LILY: The backpack's like a navy blue. &gt;&gt; OFFICER: All right, I'm gonna drive around for a little bit and go try to find him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You always have to assume the worst in a situation like this. And, hopefully, they'll catch him before he comes back here. &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't wait to to talk to Rob I have such amazing news to tell him. Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's my friend David that runs this modeling agency in Beverly Hills. He saw some pictures of you and I, and he thinks that you would be, like, an amazing model. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No, I can't do that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I totally think that you should meet with him. At least hear what he has to say. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: If it's, like, a good modeling agency, then... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's really good. And if they're calling to find <i>you,</i> that's, like, amazing. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: While my girlfriend Adrienne is in India, I was thinking I should do something to keep me busy, especially while she's gone. So I'm gonna definitely give it a shot. &gt;&gt; KIM: So you want to do it? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah, if this doesn't interfere with my school. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, well, I'm gonna call him now. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: All right, thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Someone came into Dash and vandalized the whole store. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And threw water at Lily. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, I'm just shocked, Khloe. I think this is a really dangerous situation. Go inside Smooch and lock the doors. The incident at Dash freaks me out, and it really proves that the kids need to upgrade their security situation at the store. I want all the doors locked, 'cause this is dangerous. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Hey, how are you? David. Nice to meet you. Hi! &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; DAVID: How are you? Come on back, okay? How are you guys? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Good. So, Rob, you going to school right now? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yes, I am. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Okay. Where do you go to school? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: USC. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Well, I actually, I talked to Kim because I saw some photographs of you on her MySpace, and we had a conversation about you coming in here and meeting with us. So, we'd like to take some Polaroids of you today. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: All right. Kim is the only one in our family that actually, like, started modeling. She's on magazine covers and she makes money off of it, good money, so that's why I listen to her advice and everything. &gt;&gt; DAVID: No smiles or anything, okay? Just straight at the camera. That's good. Cool. Okay, can you take your shirt off? We're done. We're gonna take a look at these Polaroids, and then we'll be right with you. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm pretty nervous because I'm just hoping that they'll understand I have potential. I don't look like a fool in front of, like, their staff or anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like now is the time to say this to myself. This is, like, the only time when we're young, and you have this amazing body now. We only have one shot in life. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Okay, so, we looked at the pictures. What we want to do is, we want to set you up with a test shoot so that we can kind of see how you photograph in a professional setting, and take a look at those pictures, and then kind of go from there and decide if we want to offer you a contract here. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: That sounds awesome. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Cool. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: After everything was all said and done, I'm definitely gonna take this opportunity. This is something that I want to do on the side, definitely. &gt;&gt; KIM: I knew you were gonna have a shoot already. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dash got vandalized. It's horrible. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are we gonna do about all this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, so I made an appointment for us three and Lily to go get self-defense classes. Um, I just think it's really important for us just to know how to defend ourselves. Like, you never know what could happen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's a good idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I'd like for you guys to have something like that under your belt, but it doesn't lend itself to taking care of somebody that comes to the front door of your store yelling and screaming. The girls are gonna take a self-defense class, which I think is great. But the problem is, it's gonna take quite some time to really perfect those kind of moves. And I want the girls to be able to protect themselves. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, taking a self-defense class would help prepare them. Who out of the three is the toughest? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY AND KHLOE: Me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For sure. Are you joking, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it's me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe, I think she's probably the meanest, Khloe's the toughest, and I don't know what we have with Kimberly. I don't know. You hit them with your compact or something? The first thing, somebody starts to attack you, scream and yell and kick and run like hell. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's enough. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Hey, Robert. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hey. How you doing? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; DAVID: This is John Russo. &gt;&gt; JOHN: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; DAVID: He's gonna be taking some pictures of you today. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Right on. &gt;&gt; DAVID: He's an amazing photographer. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm pretty nervous to do this photo shoot just because I've no idea what to expect. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Are you ready? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Okay, cool. So we'll get you, then, in your first outfit. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Okay. &gt;&gt; DAVID: And then we'll go ahead and start. &gt;&gt; JOHN: Yep. Yep, awesome. Just like that. We might have a little supermodel on our hands here. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm feeling very at ease. I'm starting to understand what he wants from me, and it's not that bad. &gt;&gt; DAVID: We're gonna do some body stuff of you next, so change into your underwear. &gt;&gt; Yes. He's got the Kim Kardashian vibe. Good for you. Look at you and your little supermodel. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: After everything was all said and done, I started to get the hang of it. The pictures turned out well. From what I saw, I liked them. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Well, I wanted to ask you this: We got an email at the agency, and it is for a job that is shooting in Japan. Can I submit you for this project? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah. I would love to. I'm excited. I think it's very flattering. You got to travel while you're young, like, go to different places, experience everything. &gt;&gt; DAVID: We're gonna try to get some of these pictures today, because these are definitely better than the Polaroids. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Okay? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Swell. &gt;&gt; DAVID: All right, cool. So good job today. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Okay, we'll talk soon. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Thanks, David. &gt;&gt; DAVID: All right, take care. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: All righty now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you excited to kick a man in his groin? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I am. &gt;&gt; LILY: That's amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Me, too. Self defense, here we come. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; NELSON: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; NELSON Hi, Khloe. I'm Nelson. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, I'm Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And that's Kim. She's really rude, but that's Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; NELSON: Why don't we start here? Have a seat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; NELSON: So what brought you guys here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, we own a couple clothing stores, and we've had some weirdos come to our store and try to vandalize it. &gt;&gt; KIM: And just things that scare us that we don't feel like we're protected. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, we just want to feel protected. &gt;&gt; NELSON: Okay, let's start. First strike is your butt strike. Major weapon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Major for Kim. &gt;&gt; Kim will do that and she can start running. &gt;&gt; NELSON: Six! Bring it up high and breathe out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, sorry! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You try to mess with me, I'll mess with you. &gt;&gt; NELSON: Good job. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think this class is going really well. He's teaching us that our body could be used as a weapon. You can't put you penis in me, buddy! Overalls-- what a fashion statement. Cute little farmer. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; NELSON: Good. Good job. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my... You got me! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: By the end of the class, we feel really good. I think that we can totally defend ourselves. &gt;&gt; NELSON: You did really well. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't think Kim's butt was useful for anything, but now I know it's a good... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a good weapon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honey, we're home. We just went to a self-defense class. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You did? What did they teach you? You want to show me? What did you learn? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here. We got home from our self- defense class and Kourtney, Kim and I are <i>so</i> excited to show Bruce all of our moves. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm the attacker. I'm coming up to get you, and here I come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. Why aren't you moving? &gt;&gt; BRUCE:Okay, yeah. And then I do this. I pick you up and throw you on your head. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They don't work. And Bruce is, like, old and everything, and they don't work. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're too tall. I feel like we don't know how to defend ourselves. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're practicing their self-defense. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't see how this is helpful for me at all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my... oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I come into the room, and the girls are showing their self-defense techniques. I'm thinking, we need to really step it up and figure out something a little more powerful. Okay, you guys, I have a surprise, all right? I need you guys tomorrow morning at 8:00. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To do what? For what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a surprise. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? What are we doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You'll see. I think it's crazy, irresponsible and stupid. Obviously, you need a little guidance because you're making a really stupid decision. &gt;&gt; KIM: Now you can eat after you're done with your shoot, finally. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I know. Thank God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Models have to starve. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm gonna be starving for a long time. &gt;&gt; KIM: How was your shoot? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I thought it went really well. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm really considering doing it as, like, a career-- or a side thing at least. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob lets me know that David from the modeling agency told him about a potential job offer in Japan. What are you gonna do about school? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Like, if I have to go to another country to do something, I'm gonna drop out of school. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Definitely. I'm gonna do it-- if the opportunity comes, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: If it's something you want to do, I mean, I'll support you no matter what. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Kim has been very supportive of this whole situation. And I know that school and education matters, but, you know, right now I just feel it, and it's just something I want to do. I just don't see it hurting me. I really don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm ready as we'll ever be. Where are we going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. We're actually going to a shooting range. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that's actually gonna be really fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you gonna buy me a 24-karat gold gun to strap on to my inner thigh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't think you guys are prepared if something really serious happens to any of you. I want you guys to put your serious faces on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; NOLAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; NOLAN: Good. How's it going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good, thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I brought my girls in to do some shooting practice, and somebody to teach us how to use a firearm. &gt;&gt; NOLAN: Okay. Do you have any experience shooting? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've never done this before, and I'm really nervous. Then I see all this, like, protective gear, and it looks like so much fun. I put it all on, and it gives me this sense of empowerment like <i>G.I. Jane.</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, I know you're fashion forward, but we're here to learn about guns. I look over, and Kim is now accessorizing her look. And I'm thinking, "This is serious. I want you to learn something from this experience, not, you know, wear the latest fashion in gun control." &gt;&gt; NOLAN: Okay, we're gonna go out to the range area. When it's time for you to actually shoot the gun, you want to make sure that you're standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. What I want you to do is, I want you to watch the gun to see how much the gun moves and how loud it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. We're not messing with <i>you.</i> &gt;&gt; NOLAN: Okay, who wants to go first? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe will go first. &gt;&gt; NOLAN: Okay, slowly apply pressure to the trigger. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's just this rush of adrenaline. It's not fun. It's scary. It's just like almost anxiousness. The visual of my fashion-forward girls at the shooting range is comical. Very <i>Charlie's Angels.</i> Nice job, girls. I'm really happy that the girls are picking this up quickly. Do you have anything more powerful than this the girls can try? &gt;&gt; NOLAN: Biggest in the bag. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yee-ha. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bring it on. &gt;&gt; NOLAN: All right, Kim, this one's for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this what they use, like, in the wars? &gt;&gt; NOLAN: That's the kind they use in the wars. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? The instructor pulls out the biggest gun that they have, and I'm so anxious to shoot it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm glad we all learned a lot today. Now I want to check out getting each one of the girls a handgun for their safety. &gt;&gt; NOLAN: Three different types of guns: nine-millimeters. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now just after one lesson at the shooting range, my mom wants to buy us all guns. I would never bring a gun into the store where my little sisters hang out. My sisters and I definitely do not want guns. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe we'll take baby steps, and for right now we'll wait. &gt;&gt; NOLAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks so much. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; NOLAN: No problem. Have a good day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. So does anybody know why Rob wants to meet? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it could have to do with his new modeling career. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Modeling career? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What's up, guys? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was the meeting? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I have a flight in two days. David from the modeling agency called and said I got the job in Japan, and I definitely am gonna do this. This is too good of an opportunity to pass up. I've decided I'm going to go to Tokyo, Japan. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How long are you going to be gone? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I've already told my advisors I'm taking time off. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're not dropping out of school. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like sometimes opportunities come, and they won't come again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, are you, like, okay? You're encouraging him to drop out of USC? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think he should drop out. I think that he should, you know, stop this semester, go away to Japan and come back, and then finish. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's crazy, irresponsible and stupid. And I think you have too much invested in your education at USC. Your dad would be so disappointed, Rob. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's the deal. Bottom line is, you're not quitting school, okay? You're going to finish school. You've got a year... less than a year and a half to go. Before Rob's dad passed away, he made a promise to him that not only would he get into SC and have the grades to do it, but he would finish SC, and we're going to make sure he does that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob's an adult. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, obviously, you need a little guidance, because you're making a really stupid decision, okay? And, Kim, I'm really disappointed in you for not being more on top of it. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You guys can sit and argue about this all you want. I gotta go pack. Leaving in two days. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You don't need to be a male model, Rob. Better be smart. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, Rob, I had a dream that you decided not to be a male model and stay in school. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: The dream was false. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Anyway, so whatever happened to that... that guy who came in the Dash? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you care? You're not even going to be here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're going to be in Tokyo, model boy. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm just worried you guys don't have enough security at Dash. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So why do you care? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm telling you, you should get some. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, the day that you stop modeling and go back to school, that's the day we'll get security. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I know my sisters are just trying to give me good advice and watch out for me and make sure I'm making the right decisions, but they're always trying to make decisions for me. I think I need to speak with someone who knows a little bit more about this situation. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Hello. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hey, baby. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Hi. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Oh, you know how I've been doing all these photo shoots with the modeling agency? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: So I called Adrienne to discuss going to Japan to become a model. I think it's a good idea. The offer's right. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Why don't you just do it right after you graduate? That's only a year away. Do you think your looks are going somewhere from this year to next year? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No. I mean, my looks will only get better but, um... they want me to go to Japan and do this, you know? If a good opportunity comes, take it. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: You're so close to graduating. Have you really thought about this? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Adrienne is really big on me staying in school, so I'm kind of getting nervous. Okay. I love you. I'll call you later. Thank you. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: My sisters aren't listening to me at all. They need to get a security guard. So I come up with this idea, and I want Scott to be a part of this as well. Does he want us to go for the danger? I don't think so. What is up? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, word! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: This is my new getup. You know how Kourtney and Kim and Chloe took self-defense classes? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. It's retarded. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What they need is a security guard. We're going to go rob them and teach them a lesson. We're going to go scare the out of them. Like, straight up, we're going to walk in there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They're going to know it's us. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: We've got ski masks. Covers your face. Put it over... All you see is the eyes. It's going to be so fun. I think it's fun towith them and, you know, just teach them a lesson. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going in there for blood. You got me involved in this. Ain't no turning back now, kid. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No turning back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No turning back. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If we're good at it, let's really go rob somebody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott? I knew it! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get on the ground! &gt;&gt; KIM: So my sisters and I are at Dash late, you know, past business hours. We have a lot of paperwork to do. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Let's line them up against the wall. Scott and I are all pumped up. We've got all black on. We're all ready to go. Get down! Get on the floor! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys are worthless. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When the burglars finally start yelling at us to, "Get on the floor!", I realized it's Scott. I knew it! Because I could tell by his voice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get on the ground! &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, this whole thing is just a big practical joke on us. Look there! Their gun is nothing real. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: On one hand, like, I'm relieved that it's Rob and Scott. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Kourtney, would you just be kissing away if you were gun-robbed? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's scared. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're also kind of pissed. Like, that's not a funny joke. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why did you guys do that? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No, seriously, though, we did this to test you guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Reality check. You Kardashians are going down. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You guys have no security. You guys take thisas a joke. You took martial arts for, like, what, an hour? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, honestly, we could have had a heart attack. You really could have hurt us with those guns. Those guns look so real. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: They're fake You guys should have security. That's the point. We had to teach you a lesson. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're doing something to prove a point. My brother is really concerned about us and our safety, which is really sweet, and we really need to take this seriously. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No, seriously, you guys should get security. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't even worry. We'll make some phone calls. We'll figure it out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We are definitely hiring security guards to be there at all times when we're there. &gt;&gt; KIM: And, Rob, I can't believe you're still here. I thought you were supposed to be in Japan. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No, I decided to stay, so I figured you guys would be happy, and not mad at me. My decision now is to not go through with the modeling, and to stay in school and graduate just as my dad wanted me to do. Adrienne's told me education is sexy. And I'll make Adrienne happy, I'll make Bruce happy, and the rest of my family happy. The point of... the point of this isn't about me. It's about you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Staying safe in the hood. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One, two, hug! &gt;&gt; KIM: Glad you're back. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KIM: You didn't go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Back is better than... &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Ow! Ow! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Disrespect! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Ow! Geez! I should have shot you when I had the chance. &gt;&gt; KIM: Next time, on <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>With the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got a little crazy and a little out of control. It sounded like a good idea after a couple of shots. &gt;&gt; KIM: So get in the car and stop being rude and depressed. It's not funny. You're trying to ruin my moment for me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is taking this situation way too far. &gt;&gt; KIM: So get away, you jealous psycho bitch!
