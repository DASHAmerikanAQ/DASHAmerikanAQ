- &gt;&gt; KRIS: You'll never guess what happened. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I cannot believe I did not tell you this. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The other day, I walk into your house... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and Scott is standing at the refrigerator butt naked. So awkward. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. What did you do? Did you see the full frontal? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you stare or did you run the other way? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I ran the other way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe I saw Scott's penis. I'm, like, traumatized. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it like this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bigger. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Or was it like this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim! Smaller than a champagne bottle and bigger than a squash. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, what about the sausage? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's it. That's exactly the size. Bingo! &gt;&gt; This has been flying by so unbelievably fast. &gt;&gt; PETER: Hey, Mason, how you doing, pal? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like he's ready to eat. &gt;&gt; PETER: You ready to eat? You look underfed. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: 18.15-and-a-half. 28 00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,776 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's staying in shape, this kid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, 31 years ago. My siblings are my best friends, and having Mason has been the most rewarding, life-changing thing that's ever happened to Scott and myself. We definitely want to have another baby, because I want to have two kids close in age like Kim and I were. Thanks, Dr. Peter. &gt;&gt; PETER: So he should come back in a month. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks, Dr. Peter. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Dolce's ready to go. Kylie, come on, keep up. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Gabbana. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, let's get a little workout in here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad, I think I'm allergic to something here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think I'm allergic to something here. I keep touching things, and it keeps itching my feet, my legs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You think you're allergic to something? What would it be, fresh air? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love spending time with my kids. And they're so busy now, I just want to get them out, get them for a hike, do something, just, you know, the three of us. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Gabbana! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, wait a second. Kylie, come on. You're making a phone call? Why don't you just leave that back in the car? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Gabbana, come here, Gabbana, come here, Gabbana. She's talking to her boyfriend. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She doesn't have a boyfriend. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Gabbana. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why do you think she has a boyfriend? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. Who else would she be texting this much? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, she's only 12; she's not allowed to date. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How old do we have to be to start dating? In your eyes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 16, 18. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Which is it, 16 or 18? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh... 17. I don't, I don't know. Whenever I quite feel ready. You have to realize, I've been through a lot with these older girls in their dating years. Kylie, let's move it! Let's go! &gt;&gt; KIM: The ice cream truck. I really want to go to the ice cream truck. Ooh, do I want an ICEE or a Bomb Pop? Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; VENDOR: Fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I get a Bomb Pop, the original? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mmm, so good. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is? All right, thank you. Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have fun. You know my friend Amy just got pregnant? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She has an eight-month-old. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So they're gonna be 16 months apart. So if Mason's six months, if I got pregnant now... &gt;&gt; KIM: When can you have sex, like, six months after? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Most people could have sex six weeks after, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...the doctor told me to wait two months. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know, but once the doctor gave us the okay, we were, like, excited to try it, but it was, like, very painful. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was painful? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, it felt like a metal pole is literally ramming you in the crotch. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott and I are doing all of the necessary things to optimize our chances of having a baby. I just wish there was some kind of way to make this whole process easier on Scott and myself. Especially me, actually. My estrogen levels are so low when you're breast-feeding... &gt;&gt; KIM: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That that's why you don't get juicy down there. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Juicy down there," that's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The juice isn't loose. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's called "buy lubricant." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who buys lube? &gt;&gt; KIM: What, like, you're afraid to buy lube? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What, I'm gonna go in the store and be like, "Hi. I need some lube." &gt;&gt; KIM: No, you'll send, like, an assistant or someone else to go buy it for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's true. I guess you could always send someone. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's no excuses. You need someone to play with. Another one of you. Yeah, yeah, yeah! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Matthew! &gt;&gt; MATTHEW: Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, let's go to my room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is Matthew. &gt;&gt; MATTHEW: I'm Matthew, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My best friend. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nice to meet you, Matthew. How long have you and Kylie known each other? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: For, like, three years. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Same grade? &gt;&gt; MATTHEW: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, where you guys going? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: To my room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think that's appropriate. Just come on back down here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. No. No. No. Seems like a nice kid. You guys stay down here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's the tough part when you have little girls. They have friends-- some boys, some girls. And right now, Kylie's having boys come over to the house, and I'm gonna keep a close eye on these guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And who are you guys? &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: I'm Justin. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, how old are you guys? &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: 13. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got a girlfriend? &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: No, not right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not right now? Yeah, you're in between women-- is that what you're trying to tell me? Yeah. We don't have any dating. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, we don't have any dating around here. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My dad can be really frustrating sometimes. He's honestly always in my business. It's not like they're my boyfriends, they're my friends that are boys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you like better, basketball or girls? Nobody's answering. Basketball? Good answer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey. Hey, babe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can you come here for a second? I just need a little help with the pasta. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll be back, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Listen, you're getting embarrassing again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I'm not embarrassing. I'm just talking with the guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what you think. What do you think seven or eight of them in there are gonna do, okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nothing. I'm just keeping an eye on them, that's all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Back off, bucko. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'll go upstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, good. Thank God. All right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You keep an eye on them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Psycho. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. 158 00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,689 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, you're welcome, honey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wonder, if we had another child, if it would be as adorable as Maseford. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right? Kim was saying we need to start using some lube. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I'm down. You're running in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not gonna run in. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nobody's gonna recognize you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, but then if you run in, they're gonna know that you're getting it for us. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I'm not that embarrassed that I'm going home to plow my wife up with a lot of lube all over it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just unnecessary. There's always paparazzi, like, inside of the stores taking a picture of your bag. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So what do you expect me to do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm fine. Like, I'm not having you go in and buy lube. Dumb plan. Like, I don't want to do this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't worry. All your troubles will be away soon enough. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The last thing I need is for anyone to see me or Scott buying lube. It's just a little bit embarrassing. So what are we...? We're not getting out of the car. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. I'm going to wait until I find somebody to go in there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And what are you going to say to them? That's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna say-- I'm gonna say, "How you doing, guy? You want to go in there and buy some lube for me, and I'll give you 20 bucks or 30 bucks." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And what are they going to say? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you. I'm gonna go get lubed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's just go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't need... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is ridiculous. People are... Aw. This is insane. &gt;&gt; MAN: How you doing, young man? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing, guy? Yeah, I don't... I do kind of look like Tom. &gt;&gt; MAN: I knew it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to get somebody to go buy me something. You want to... Your work here? What are you doing? Oh, you don't work here? Yeah, you don't want to make any money, do you by any chance? I just need someone to go in there and buy me, like, lube. I don't care what kind it is. I just... I don't want to go in there. My girlfriend doesn't want me to go in there. I'll give you like... It can't be more than, like, $10, $15. I'll just give you $50. Just buy me, like, the biggest box of lube. I'm going to be in the black Mercedes. Thanks, buddy. You don't care, right? It'll take two seconds. All right, I'll just be in my car. Thanks, buddy. No big deal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I found this nice little gentleman. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was a young dude. He was just sitting there hanging out. 213 00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:07,147 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hanging out at the pharmacy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. All good? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, thanks, bro. &gt;&gt; MAN: There you go. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, man. You're good, right? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, thanks. Here we go. It's lube time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bingo. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go home and get this baby lube making on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I cannot believe that guy actually did it. &gt;&gt; BOY: Hey, can we order some pizza? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. 226 00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,954 Let's go order some right now. &gt;&gt; BOY: All right, let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I turn my head for fives seconds, and a boy is up in Kylie's room. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Two-- just two larges. All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We have rules in this house. No boys up here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad, are you crazy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Zack, you, out of here. I said there was no boys... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, way! We're ordering pizza, and they're my friends! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No boys up here! I got all these girls in my house, and I know when things are going on. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You broke the rules. I want the boys out of here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Broke the rules? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I said no boys upstairs. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad, you're so annoying, and I'm never going to talk to you again, 'cause you always do this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Just because I'm the youngest... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You threaten that every day. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...doesn't mean I can't have, like, friends that are guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I want the boys out of the house. 249 00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,199 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't care. Just leave. Leave. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We can't just have sex just to have sex. Just do what you're supposed to do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've had enough of this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing here? How did you get here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: A car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom and Dad know you're here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How do you want to do this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You got to... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Put the book down. Let's get the old-fashion... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nope. Book says... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So sideways is good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It says... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A little one of these. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We can't just have sex just to have sex. 'Cause every time we do it, it lowers your sperm count. So it needs to be in the most optimal way each and every time. Um, "Sex... How to make love to get pregnant..." But... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They said to put a pillow under you. To get your crotch in the right area. Come on. All right. I already feel like it's ready to go. Mama. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, put the book down... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...and let's just get to business. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. We're gonna do it wrong. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're not... How are we going to do it wrong? We made him right the first time. I know what to do. It's a little one of these... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're gonna do it wrong. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...a little one of those. A little side step. I was very excited to find out that Kourtney wanted to have another baby. But now that she's brought it down to statistics and scientifical facts of how to get pregnant, she's taken all the fun out of it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm saying deep penetration. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that would have been hard to forget. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You on top. Cervix angled at a 45-degree... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is ridiculous. Are we even going to kiss? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: After the fight with my dad, I just really couldn't stand, like, being in the same house with him. So, I called a car service, and I went to Khloe's. Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You scared the out of me. What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How did you get here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Honestly... A car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whose car? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: A driver. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, what? What happened? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad is being really annoying, and he's getting on my nerves, and I really can't even stand being around him. Can I just please, like, spend the night here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does Mom and Dad know you're here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say Bible. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't do that. What do you mean they don't know you're here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just kind of left. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to have to call them and tell them you're here. I can't not tell them. Okay. 308 00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:24,637 You go upstairs. Oh... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hit her with a... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How you doin', guy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where should I put Mason? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have to keep him down low. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here, we'll put him here for now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Down low. You guys seem like you're in a good mood. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Me and this one-- we've beenlike cats and dogs all day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We actually don't have time to hump. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I'm very happy to make a baby, but it's like it's all business to her now. She's not even looking for pleasure. You would think when your girlfriend only has one thing on her brain, and that's sex, that would be a good thing. Not in this case. Because it's not sex-- it's strictly business. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fruits and vegetables that are high in lycopene include tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit... &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Semen volume enhancement pills. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're getting a little obsessed with this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It increases sperm fertility. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't you remember last time? It just happened. Just like it will this time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why can't we just order the pills? They're not... they're all herbal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's the point? We did it right the first time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All they're going to do is enhance your sperm, which means more chances of getting pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just not that fun anymore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just do what you're supposed to do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've had enough of this. There's only so many times I can ejaculate in one day, okay? This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, seriously. Like, that was rude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, you're making him feel like he's literally just a sperm donor. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, if I get pregnant now, my children will be 16 months apart. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you had a baby in a year, they would be two years apart. You know? It's like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. I just always think of them being, like, super close. &gt;&gt; KIM: They will be super close. A year, two years-- that's not far apart. You and I are 18 months. That's close. Let it happen the old-fashioned way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm forcing myself to have painful sex. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, like, that's ridiculous. Wait. Let your vagina heal up a little bit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. I'll lay off that sausage for a little while. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, seriously, enough of Scott and his sausage. Like, I can't hear it anymore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I've had enough of it, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have you seen Kylie? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm calling to tell you that she's here at my house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How the hell'd she get over there?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Apparently, she took a car service over here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Aah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, literally... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ah, these girls drive me crazy! I mean, we're scared to death over here. I mean, it's just ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Apparently, I think you guys should have, like, a night of separation. I mean, she basically, like, ran away. And I just yelled at her for it, so she knows she's wrong, but she just said she's emotionally drained and she needs to go... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. All right. Bring her back tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, that's gonna... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So I can deal with her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm sure she's excited to wake up tomorrow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, get her butt back over here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-kay, mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, thanks. 384 00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,627 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Smoking up? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know. I'm a disgusting person. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just telling you that I'm sorry for going a little too crazy with everything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's-- how did this whole, this whole second change of heart come? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I just realized that, you know, I want Mason to have another sibling, but it'll happen when it will happen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I agree. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And there's no need to rush things. We can go back to good old-fashioned, fun sex. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Knocking the boots. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know, finding out that I was pregnant with Mason was a total surprise, and I couldn't have been more lucky. And I think that I want to go back to just doing this the fun way, and if it's meant to be, it will be. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, does this mean less or more sex? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This means when we're in the mood, we're in the mood. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You in the mood? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not right this second. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce? Br-r-ruce? Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. Well, it's the little baby snatcher. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get you're pissed. I get you want to yell and ground her and this and that, but Kylie is a good kid. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hold it, hold it. Here you are defending her when she left the house, got a car... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For good reasons. Calm down a minute. I understand that Kylie leaving here without telling anyone definitely at 12 years old is not ideal. I get that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. But I think from every mistake that Kourtney, Kim, Robert and I have ever made, you're already saying Kylie's made those mistakes. Until she gives you a reason to not trust her, you got to get over it. You do. 'Cause one day, she's gonna run away and never come back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been through this before with all these girls, you know? I don't mind being the bad guy. I want to be a good parent. I'll talk to her, but I'm gonna come down on her for leaving the house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think you should. And I'm not telling you not to be a parent here, I'm just saying, you guys need to talk this through 'cause it's not getting any better. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where is she? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In the car. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: In the car? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She was waiting. I was trying to filter all this. You wait. She's gonna be afraid if she sees you. 434 00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:11,417 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You left the house. We were scared to death. We had no idea where you were at. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I can't talk to you, 439 00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,562 so I'd rather just, like, not talk to you and just leave. 441 00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:39,045 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. First of all, those shorts are way too short. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're not too short. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They are, but anyway. Sit down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's not gonna hurt you. I've already spoken to him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: First of all, my biggest problem, Kylie, is this: You left the house, didn't tell anybody where you were going, got a car, you went over to Khloe's, didn't tell anybody. We were scared to death. We had no idea where you were at. Why did you go over there? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Because I can't, like, talk to you. It's, like, hard to talk to you, so I'd rather just, like, not talk to you and just leave. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Most of the time, I try to talk to you, I get no response out of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's also 12 years old. Like, I ran away before, I just wasn't smart enough to rent a town car. I just walked down the street with a red wagon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who am I talking to, you? Or am I talking to Kylie? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but she doesn't know-- I don't... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You don't have to answer for Kylie. I mean, if you got problems, you got things going on, you know, I'm your best friend. I'm gonna give you good advice. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Every single time I talk to you, you're like, "I don't want to be your best friend, I want to be your father." So don't start going, "I want to be your best friend," because you always say, "I'm not your best friend." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Be-- it's-- Okay. You have a point. I like that. But, uh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sounds like you two are on a very positive flow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just moving right along. All right. I apologize if I've been a little tough on you, but that's more my hang-up of being overprotective. And so I want you to be able to talk to me anytime you want, about anything, whether it's boys, whether it's your girlfriends.
