- KOURTNEY: So Mason and I are living at Auntie Kimmy's house, and today I'm going to show my family this house that I'm considering putting a bid on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is really nice. Hi, Masey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, let's show you the front really quick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like this, Kourtney. It's a great neighborhood. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Guys, pay attention. Let's go upstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Pool. And you could sit along there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this a house Scott are buying or just you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm buying the house. I want my own house that is mine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you want him to live with you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. Well, we'll see. Scott and I have been talking with our therapist about potentially moving in together again, and we know what a huge step that is. Scott has been doing everything I've asked of him, and we've both been working on this relationship, and we both agree that we want to continue sharing our lives together if everything keeps going in this positive way that it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Will you have it, like, in a contract that he can't take it from you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How can he take it if I own it? I wish that I could have Scott my family here, you know, while I'm house hunting, but it's still a little bit awkward, so I have to set up two separate appointments, and, you know, it just makes things a little more complicated. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Vibrator. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: It turned on! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. Turn it off. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a vibrator. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Turn it off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We didn't turn it on. We shut the drawer, and it started vibrating. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So turn it off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not touching it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What drawer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The top one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's not sanitary. I'm serious-- put it down. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How thedo you turn it off? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Put it under her pillow. She'll think she did it herself. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It won't go off, you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew, I can't believe you touched it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just put it down. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There, I got it off. So nasty. I got to wash my hands. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. 51 00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:24,211 52 00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,548 &gt;&gt; You need a brother or a sister. "I agree!" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Maybe what she needs is a puppy. Stay right there. Let's go. Do it. Good dog. I think that male dogs always respond better to the leader of the pack, and that's me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, since you're such the leader, you can watch him for a little longer. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. You mean I get to keep Rocky? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Rocky is Reggie's dog. I got it for him about a year ago. He has a really hectic schedule, so he's left the dog with me and Bruce. Bruce has really taken Rocky under his wing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come here! Good dog. Sit. Sit. Sit right there. Hey, at least we get a little workout in, huh? We'll watch a little Animal Planet or something. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Bruce really loves having Rocky around. It's like having another male in his life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look what I got in my pocket. Dog biscuits. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's why Rocky likes you, is 'cause he can smell the treats in your pocket. That is disgusting. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're just dog biscuits. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll give you a snack in the other room, Scooby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: You do not need to eat a dog biscuit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're just... I mean, they're obviously edible. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is so... That is disgusting! He doesn't want it from you. Rocky is not gay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He took it. 86 00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,738 You want one? &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is Bruce the only one that doesn't like, like, a real plate? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Because I'm the one who has to clean it up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're not going to do the dishes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would love for you to do the dishes one day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When's the last time Mom did dishes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 1984. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was born that year. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. So, Scott's birthday is coming up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: May 26. He's told me that he sent you an e-mail to invite you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Never got an e-mail. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-uh. Where are you doing his birthday? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're going to Vegas. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's going to be in another city doing a speech. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I'm going to have to let you know, Kourtney, because I'm supposed to be working. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And how about you, Khloe? Are you available? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not even going to think to invite Khloe 'cause I know she won't go. I think it's sad that I have to practically beg people to go to something like Scott's birthday. It's really frustrating that I basically have to lead two lives, one with my family and one with Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He wants this. It matches his shirt. Exactly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Grab it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice, Mason. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scared you to death, 117 00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,348 didn't they? Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing, honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fixing some things on my helicopter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can you take those boxes of those shirts over to the Dream Center? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can I go through them first? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, honey, we just took them out of your closet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe I have a sentimental one or a favorite one. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kris, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Rocky, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; MAN: This is yours, I presume? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: He was in my yard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; MAN: You really have to get him neutered, I mean, because he's all over the place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rocky, come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rock, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're horny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rocky is such a menace. This is, like, the third time that Rocky's been caught getting busy with the neighbor dogs, and they keep dragging him home. And Bruce thinks it's funny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Way to go, stud. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No way to go! It's not funny. We have to do something about this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's like, you don't want to commingle, like, that... that whole thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We don't want mixed breeding? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, like me and you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You saw how that went wrong. &gt;&gt; MAN: The Artisan suite! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you? Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Jess, you look nice. &gt;&gt; JESS: Oh, thank you. I had to dress up for your birthday. &gt;&gt; MAN: Where's the rest of the family at? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No one came. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll tell you one reason why. You're looking at it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They could make a little more effort. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course, they could. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're in Vegas celebrating Scott's 27th birthday, and all of his close friends made it out here. All right, let's go have fun. &gt;&gt; JESS: Well, who cares, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. Not even one of my family members made any effort to come. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This chair is not big enough. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is, like, Scott's ideal dream. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How much to buy this? I'll take this home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. You know what I've been thinking lately? I need a major break. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I don't? I've been dealing with this for years! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We should go spend more time in New York. Scott's never made it a secret how much he loves living in New York City, where his mom and dad are, and living in New York is something that I've actually considered as well. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, so you really would consider moving to New York for real now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't say move 100%. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 100%, we're going to move to New York. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where do you translate these things from? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You said, "We're going downtown." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I said we will go and spend some time there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And not come back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Happy birthday. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks, doll. It's the best birthday I could imagine. I know it's bad luck to tell your wish to everybody, but I must say I have to, and my wish would be to get the hell away from her family in California and get to New York where my family is, and hopefully this wish will come true. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What a great wish. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So we will surely see. Help me out so we definitely go. He soiled my duds. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was insane. 185 00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,192 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He just spit all over the thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you guys having fun out here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Rocky. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rocky and I are cleaning the motorcycle off. Hopefully, he doesn't slobber on it! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe he'll hump it instead. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you want to wait and clean the bike on Thursday, Rocky will be busy. He won't be here. Rocky has a doctor's appointment. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rocky has a doctor's appointment? &gt;&gt; KIM: Rocky's getting neutered on Thursday. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's the deal with you girls? That's not fair. It changes the whole personality of the dog. This is a great little dog. &gt;&gt; KIM: This appointment's happening Thursday at 3:00 p.m., so you can be there or not... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I'm gonna go? What am I gonna do, hold him? Why would I want to go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The dog was down the street having sex with all the other dogs, humping the dogs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think the problem is you girls need to be humped more often. That's the problem we got here. You, to the bedroom. You, go find somebody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You and your best friend can go get neutered together. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. 3:00. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thursday, 3:00. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thursday. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not happening! I don't think we should do it today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, the dog is not our dog. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's my dog, we're doing it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're not gonna do it right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, are you moving to New York? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I looked at places. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so dramatic of you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What the hell are you talking about? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, Rock. &gt;&gt; KIM: Go on, Rocky. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't blame you. Look-it, he's afraid to get out of the car. &gt;&gt; KIM: Come on, Rocky. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't blame you. He can sense what he's gonna go through. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're just gonna get your balls chopped off. It's not that big of a deal. &gt;&gt; VETERINARIAN: Hi, Rocky. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Soon to be Rockette. &gt;&gt; VETERINARIAN: He's still gonna be Rocky. Let's go ahead and let's put him up on the table. I'm gonna have Jeanie hold him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, what's the deal, like after you... &gt;&gt; VETERINARIAN: It's not gonna make him in any way shape or form different. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't quite go with the, uh, "Oh, no change in personality." &gt;&gt; VETERINARIAN: If you want them, we do have Neuticles for dogs and they... &gt;&gt; KIM: Neuticles? &gt;&gt; VETERINARIAN: A Neuticle is, um, a testicular implant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a boob job for a dog. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I vote... leave him the way he is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't get a vote. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's my dog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's like everything else in life? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you just don't get a vote. It's not your decision. Do you want the dog to get cancer? Do you want the dog to have problems later on in life? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just a lot healthier to do it. It's my dog, we're doing it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm here for you, big guy. Here's the deal. I don't think we should do it today. Right now, we'll just think about this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We don't have time, she's going out of town, I'm busy working. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm taking the dog. Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who put you in charge of Rocky? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Me. For today. 254 00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,815 No, we're out of here. Let's run. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're in New York, doll, finally. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We just landed in New York City, and it's actually really cool to see how excited Scott is to be here and to start house hunting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh. But look, doll. Imagine this is where you have to go to work. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, beautiful here. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: We're in the northeast corner of Tribeca. Super safe, super private, only seven units in the building. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kitchen's great. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: It's beautiful. The household eat-in area. Half bath. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is an amazing bathroom. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This apartment is amazing. I could totally see myself living here in New York, raising Mason here. It's such a great energy. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: Wood-burning fireplace, beamed ceilings. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, wait, here's my mom. Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm walking into a possible nursery for Mason in Greenwich Village. And the place has, like, a view of a church. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What place? Where in...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The place that we're looking at. We're looking at places today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, who are you with? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just Scott and, um, the realtor. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're with a realtor in New York? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, I tell you things, you just don't listen to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, Kourtney, I think I would've remembered you going to look with a realtor in New York. That-that wouldn't be something that would just slip my mind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, I'm not in the mood to talk to you right now. Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: "Ditto." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Toodles. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did she say "ditto"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Ditto." I know my mom's acting shocked that I'm looking at places in New York, but Scott's really working on himself to be a better person and a good father to Mason. I just don't need this kind of negative energy around us. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's a New York baby now. Look at this guy. He's New York at heart. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Rock. Hi, Rock. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's here, Rocky. Look out. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I did major research. The Neuticles... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...aka fake balls, really do work. I know you're trying to hold on to as many balls as possible since you've had yours chopped 20 years ago when you met my mother. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God gave him testosterone; why do you want to change a dog like that? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want, like, millions of Rockys running around here. I got one dog; that's all I can handle. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're getting so dramatic. dog; this is decision; Rocky's getting neutered. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have no choice, 314 00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,808 that's good. Rock, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: Such a pretty day. I love it here. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Hey, ladies. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Good. Here's a menu. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just glad you guys were both on time, because I wanted you guys to get here before Kourtney shows up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She was actually looking at places to buy in New York and told me that she's moving there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, she told you and she didn't tell us? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's just being dramatic. That's how Kourtney is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't even-- I'm not sleeping. &gt;&gt; KIM: Could you imagine what life without Mason would be like? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We won't see him go to his first, you know, nursery school. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here's Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, there's Masey! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Mase. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Mase. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, are you moving to New York? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, I mean, I looked at places. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I know what you're doing, though. You're just mad that none of us went to Scott's birthday party, and you're trying to, like, now alienate us. You think you're, like, getting back at us. You're just being over the top. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me tell you something. You-- I would never expect to go to Scott's birthday. You-- he, like, went out of his way to e-mail you. You could've at least responded. And you-- like, I get you're busy, but, like, you know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So is that what you're doing? You're mad that Mom didn't reply and Kim didn't go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just uncomfortable that I have to live two lives, pretty much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I'm not gonna kiss your ass just to get you to stay here. If you're gonna be this dramatic, and now you want to just pack up and leave to go to New York just to prove a point and to, like, put it in all of our faces, fine, do that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine, I will. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Rock. In a man, out an it. &gt;&gt; VETERINARIAN: Hi, there. So we're really gonna do it, huh? No grabbing and running? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nah, he's fine, he's fine. &gt;&gt; VETERINARIAN: You know, we were talking about the Neuticles. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is all too weird for me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you think, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Smaller the better. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The smaller, the better. So we're going with the little ones? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't like big balls on a dog, but what is-- on anyone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, let's go with the small ones. I'm with you. All right, Rock, I'm saying my good-byes. Good-bye. &gt;&gt; VETERINARIAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, we'll be back. &gt;&gt; VETERINARIAN: We'll talk to you later. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The only thing I can do now is be supportive as I possibly can for Rocky, take care of the dog and hope for the best. &gt;&gt; KIM: You sure you're okay, Bruce? 375 00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:51,083 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's gonna be fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Girls, your grimy fingers, get them out. Get a plate. Seriously, get a plate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, I didn't know you were home. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Will you guys come in here? I want to talk to you. Please? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: About what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me five minutes. &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My pasta's not quite ready yet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, but I need to talk to you right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ready, three, two, one. Me pasta is ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so we have got a major problem. I really feel. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're pregnant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not pregnant. I really feel like Kourtney and Scott are gonna move to New York... which means Mason's not gonna be here anymore. So we have to figure out a way to keep 'em here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You know how he got mad at us for not going to his birthday? We could, like, throw him our own little party. &gt;&gt; KIM: He would like that. He would feel, like, really welcomed, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's actually not a bad idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I think the most important thing is we need Khloe there because he knows Khloe hates him, and if Khloe's there and makes, like, an effort... It has to be all of us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If we could get Khloe to the party... 403 00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,368 &gt;&gt; KIM: It'll be, like, perfect. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Seal the deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Looking at Louis Vuitton. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What brings you here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I actually wanted to talk to you about Scott. I wanted to see how you felt about throwing him a birthday party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney is your best friend, and Mason is your nephew, so if you don't try to stop this, Khloe, you're gonna lose both of them. Don't you care? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not gonna happen. I think you're way too dramatic, and I'm just over this conversation. Why would you throw someone a birthday party that has been so blatantly disrespectful on a repetitive level where it just doesn't stop? I don't understand how at all this makes sense in her head. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just have to get dressed and show up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't I let you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what? Keeping me posted is always a no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have fun at your party. 425 00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,643 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's over. &gt;&gt; KIM: No turning back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Poor guy. It'd just be a tough thing to go through, I think. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get your balls chopped off? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Maybe we should get him something. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like a little stuffed animal as a thank you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A treat. A stuffed animal or a treat or something. Well, he probably can have now a pink leash. You know? Uh-oh, my God, what'd you do to the poor guy. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Here you go. Here's your boy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: He did fine. Rocky, come back over here. So, the Neuticles are just fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: And everything went real well throughout the surgery, okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: He's looking and feeling the same, but he can't reproduce. So, that's your poor thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh! No more chicks. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: No more chicks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Good deal. Thanks very much. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. Spayed and neutered, always good. Think I should carry him? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. You'll like, hurt his balls. You'll, like, crunch them. 450 00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,926 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's happy to be out of there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Rocky... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, it's a surprise party for Scott. Let's get your party groove on, kids! Rob, you with me? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, you're crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I could use a little help here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoever likes Scott the least has to do the most work. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh! &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, Mom, I will hit you. Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, what are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that a joke? You, like, forced me to come here. I'm here fighting for Kourtney. I do want Kourtney to stay. If Kourtney did go to New York, I would be so sad. I don't think I'll ever forget all the stuff Scott's done, but just by me coming to Scott's birthday party, it says a lot for me 'cause it's a baby step that I'm taking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wear the hat for ten minutes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm not wearing the hat for ten minutes. Mom, I'm here. Stop forcing the situation. I'm here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, Khloe, just a little hat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, everybody stop. Get right behind me. Okay, Kendall, you stay there. Bruce, you're, like, being a pain in the ass. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the dumbest thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go. I'm back here. &gt;&gt; ALL: Surprise! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Happy birthday, Scott! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, way to go, honey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My birthday was two weeks ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Mason! Oh, I'm so sorry, Masey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Happy birthday party! Yay! Yay! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you having a good time? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Happy birthday, Scott! Yay! &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay, yay, yay. Yay! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe is so over the top. Like, we know you don't feel that way about Scott. This fake bullis not necessary. Khloe obviously doesn't want to be here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know Khloe. And she never would have come if she really didn't want to be here. I think that it's just a little awkward, and we're just trying to show Scott that we really want to be here to celebrate his birthday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, it doesn't seem like it to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, we can't turn back time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Clearly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can't make it his birthday all over again, okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, this party has been a lot of fun. So, gotta go. Love you guys. Rob, we'll see you at home. Okay, Masey, I love you. Ta-ta. 503 00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,191 Good riddance to you, soldier. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. Hell of a birthday bash. Next on Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; ROB: I love hickies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. We're trying to watch a movie. I am not okay with Rob and Malika dating. Ew! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been asked to co-manage a new band called The Fiji Five. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have plenty going on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't think I made the right decision.
