Amen to you. Tell him about you prank- calling the sex hotline. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When we were younger, we used to call, there was this sex hotline... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...for girls, guys have to pay. And, like, you'd call the hotline, and you leave a voice mail. Like, "I'm Tiffany. I'm 18. 91 00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,221 And I'm blonde and blue-eyes." Whatever.

That was the most fun thing ever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys need to get a sexual grip on yourselves. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all, she's only giving you one side of the story. There's two sides to every story. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How can you guys getting on a sex line be two sides of a story? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The sex hotline pulled you in and spit you out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And sucked you off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give it to me. Give it to me. I want to have some phone sex. Hi. 117 00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:58,532 How are you, sexy? I'm looking for a... A...

And I was, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He probably thought you were such a whore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He thought I was, like, doing it, like, for real. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, well, you're making me out to be a freak, and you're the ones talking about sex all the time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who's the one who has a sex mask next to her bed, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, touché. Are you, like, touching yourself? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm itching myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you were having sex with only one person, then you wouldn't have crabs. &gt;&gt; ROB: I got waxed. There's a difference. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really? Are you a porno star? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Porno stars get waxed. &gt;&gt; ROB: Guys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Go get Khloe's mask. Go get it. Khloe's sex toys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My sex mask. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look good like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It hurts my eyes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that what you like when you're having sex? Like your eyes hurt, so you're like, "Ow." No, thanks. Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah! Come on, Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop, Khloe! Ow! That's what you do. &gt;&gt; ROB: You guys are whores. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You, guys, we really can't talk like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What makes you so uncomfortable about sexual talk? Take the dingleberry out of your and eat it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Put some cortisone cream over there and chill out. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We embrace our sexuality. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, remember that gift basket that that we got Kim? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you guys ever get me baskets like that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What gift basket? &gt;&gt; KIM: It was, like, a sex gift basket. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello! &gt;&gt; KIM: What is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We brought you your new boyfriend. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This feels weird. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Caterpillar. He vibrates. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is all, Kim, we brought this for you to cheer you up a little. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, clamps. Look at how hard those look. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow! That just hurt mythinking about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your? My... my hair! Oh, my, God, how does a girl put this on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's for guys, maybe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it is? There's dental dam. What's dental dam? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Dental floss when you getstuck in it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You stick it like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You put your penis in it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's like underwear. And then the person like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It tastes good actually. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe it's so they keep doing it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lick it. Tastes good. Oh, look, it gets sheerer the more you lick it. Look. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew! All right, guys, I really appreciate it, but... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Smells like chocolate. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...I definitely will not be using any of this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll leave you the &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you even use any of that stuff? Don't lie! Why would you lie? &gt;&gt; ROB: A hundred percent she used it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She used it, and then regifted it. &gt;&gt; ALL: Ew! &gt;&gt; ROB: You know everyone thinks we're into each other, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Incest is best. Didn't anyone teach you that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, it's vulgar. Stop. Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh! My girlfriend just told me that the picture of Kourtney looks a little creepy over my bed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ROB: Get off me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I had a bra, a push-up bra. Rob got a boner about seeing my boobs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; ROB: I didn't get a boner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? Give it to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: When Rob was really little, he was like a baby, Kourtney and I had to change his diaper once, and we would flick histo see, like, what would happen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is that funny? It's, like, incestuous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See, the family that plays together, stays together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, that's way too much information. I've had it with talking about sex. I want to talk about the drama. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY AND KHLOE: Save the drama for your mama! Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You are going to be a father. Can you turn yourself around? What the hell were you thinking? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't give a about all these losers that 216 00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,810 already call me fat. I don't give a Junk in the baby. baby, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bible. Junk in the Trunk 2. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You try to say everything we say. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, Bible is our word. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't even know what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Finally you guys showed up to my barbeque. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's the topic of discussion today? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom is just trying to talk like us... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...and she doesn't get to stay in her age lane. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stay in your decade. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stay in your decade. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why does there always have to be drama in this family? I don't want to talk to her... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just said... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...if that's what her attitude is. You're wrong! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not wrong! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go to your room. I can't even look at you right now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You broke the rules. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Just leave! &gt;&gt; ROB: Scream about it, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't know when to apologize. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, why don't you punish me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He is disgusting. I want nothing to do with him. We learned from the best-- the king and the queen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what, this family would just fall apart if I wasn't in it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it would. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am the moral high road. I keep it real. I try to... real. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know when I open up my mouth, you're going to have some words of wisdom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Amen, sister. Amen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Like the conversation I had with Scott. We had to to talk man-to-man. When it comes to Scott, I think he just has to have a talking-to about what happened in Vegas. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. Stop it. Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You saw what he did in Vegas. He shoved a hundred-dollar bill down a waiter's throat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruce, sorry I'm late. I was on a conference call to New York. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah, yeah. This behavior cannot continue. He has to change, or he's out of here. First of all, you have a control problem when it comes to drinking. What the hell were you thinking? You are going to be a father. Certainly that behavior from the other night is not what you would want your son to see. Correct? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think so. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Kids learn by example. You're the dad. Can you turn yourself around? Or is this such a big problem you don't even think you can do it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's the problem exactly? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The other night-- we'll start with that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was just everything bottling up inside of me. And then it kind of all coming out in Vegas. In the complete wrong setting. I am sorry for what happened. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This will never ever happen again. Especially if I'm around. I won't let it happen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're just, honestly lucky I wasn't there. I would have taken you out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, touché. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you, thank you. I just want to know when I give those great... when I give those great words of wisdom, does anybody listen? &gt;&gt; ROB: Apparently not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I personally do not, but I know Scott probably does. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't think so. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not so much. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't think so. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I remember a little tiff Brucie and I had over some choice words that I love to say on a daily. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I never argue. Come on, I'm not the drama queen. I'll get shot for bringing this up, but don't you think you should lose a few pounds? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't you think you should lose a few pounds? I mean, it's not major. Khloe, don't walk away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm done. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're avoiding it. That's why you're running around wearing black. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was wearing black 'cause I was depressed! No, I don't give aabout all these losers that already call me fat on Web sites and on the Internet and TV and whatever. I don't give ahow many times those people call me fat. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why don't...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, can I just...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why don't you just stop your swearing and maybe you'll get thinner. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because that's how I'm allowed to express myself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You swear too much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But my own stepdad, who I've known since I've been four... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If you're going to have an intelligent conversation with me, Khloe, I'm not going to do it while you swear away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you too intelligent to listen to the wordsand? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can't even speak the English language without swearing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So are not in the English language? I want you to know I'm not fat. But because I'm actually secure with myself, it's okay. But keep putting me down. It's fabulous, I love it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think she's so secure with herself. She's cussing at us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We've come a long way, because now Kourtney has actually told you to stop cussing in front of Mason, okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I try. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's going to happen at the point when you have a child? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would love to know that answer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I probably will not, but I've only been married a year. I do not have a kid yet. It's really weird that I'm married. Like, you became a bridezilla. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She was a little crazy, wasn't she? &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, that was like a miracle wedding. Nine days. Nine days? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In nine days. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've waited my whole life to give a wedding. Come on, come on, let's go see where we can register. Did you ever figure out your song? I remember coming here, and I stood in this same room going, "I want the Bujalatá." And then with my friends... That's a good list. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't get to invite your loser friends. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't get to tell me who I don't get to invite, because it's not your wedding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't need any of this I could get some flowers, some candles and go eat Baskin-Robbins and be happy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honestly, I need a nap. Okay, wait till the next one gets married, and then I'll really... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've already been married 20 years. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You will not be involved in those weddings. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know a lot funnier stuff, like which certain someone is completely terrified of the ocean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KIM: Not me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's mean. I don't like even talking about it. I want to get on the boat! Oh, something touched me! Something is touching me! We have breast milk inside. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll try it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do a little sip or I'm going to kill you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ♫ Junk in the Trunk part two. ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Junk in the Trunk... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Part two. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY AND KHLOE: ♫ Junk in the Trunk. ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Part two. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY AND KHLOE: ♫ Junk in the Trunk... ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM AND KYLIE: Part two. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob, why aren't you adding into the song? &gt;&gt; ROB: Because I think it's stupid. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, thank you, Rob. I agree. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I think you would be good at doing a song. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want to know, do you girls actually think that you're funny? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We know we're funny. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm hilarious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? I'll be the judge of that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Leave her alone. Watch your leg. It's going to hurt more. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's a spider on your head. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My little friend. &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe, you act like a little kid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She my best friend. &gt;&gt; ROB: You still sleep with Kiki. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You still sleep with Kiki. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kiki is the best. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't find my Kiki. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love Kiki. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have my Kiki in my closet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want Kiki. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just want to know who is Kiki? You're still in bed with your baby blankey. You still have this? &gt;&gt; ROB: This is Kiki. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is Kiki. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kiki! Oh! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's embarrassing. What is that? Throw up? &gt;&gt; ROB: I burned it on a lamp. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You still sleep with Kiki. That is so scary. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's Lamar's beard hair, I think. I found it on my Kiki. If I make a wish, it's a lucky charm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of bed. We have work to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hmm. I'm not getting out right now. I'm cuddling. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: What do girls say about your Kiki? &gt;&gt; ROB: They think it's kind of kinky. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob, I think it's so cute! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kiki. &gt;&gt; ROB: At least I'm not afraid of the ocean. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, low blow. I like that there is, like, a bunch of people. &gt;&gt; MAN: Push us into it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hope so. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: All right, step down right in here between these two and hold onto the boat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, please. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Please. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Lamar's in there. He's waiting. Lamar's in the ocean. Go meet him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, shut the up. &gt;&gt; MAN: You can do it. One, two... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna die. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna die. I don't know what's under me. Please, I can't even look. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's water. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, no, no. I think I'm going to hyperventilate. You guys are gonna kill me. I want to get on the boat. Please! Aah! You scared me! That person scared me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's just go right back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Something touched me! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Something is under there! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Roar. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, the whales are gonna come get you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop! I hate whales. But this was not the first time Kourtney dragged me, in Miami, out in the, like, the deserted water. This was actually the second time. The first time... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...you were much better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My God. You did good, Kourtney. You did. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, you have to try it.

Please! Please, please. You are so mean. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, Miami-- seriously-- looks like so much fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, you have no idea. This one in action-- the single Kourtney-- I've never seen 439 00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,007 Kourtney so wild in those six months of being single. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hotness! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're so embarrassing, so stop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hot to trot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're like a horny little toad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, is there anything wrong with...

And why is it laying on my floor? How did it get on the floor here if you went out last night? &gt;&gt; ROB: I put it in my pocket. I don't like to leave the condom wrapper wherever I am.

Our family is so gross and inappropriate that we're actually rubbing off on Scott's family. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My parents-- they love you no matter what you do. You could kick my dad in the jimmy and he'd still love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your dad would love it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If we told my parents we were moving to New York, they would take us both welcomely into their arms. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I agree. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Should we call them right now and ask them? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wake them up and like, "Dad, what if Kourtney kicked you in the?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY (with New York accent): Right in his New York &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't give a .. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your dad, when I see him, will be like, "Kick me." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Mom.

You guys are lovey-dovey at all times. It's annoying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, watch yourself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's wrong with that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because you try to be lovey-dovey with Lamar and I always have to check you and say, "He's my husband and not yours." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now wait, hold it. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, but Khloe really isn't the crazy one.

Oh, come on. : I don't need any kissing. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is it that you see in him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's, like, one side of him that I really like, then there's one side that I literally despise. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the?! I'm a very big admirer of this body, but lubed up, it's a whole 'nother work of art. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, deleting pictures of Scott from my computer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just have to stop thinking about it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, don't, don't.

We didn't mean to swerve. &gt;&gt; ROB: Sorry, Officer. &gt;&gt; MAN: Sorry. &gt;&gt; OFFICER: Have a good night. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. Thank you. Have a good night. &gt;&gt; MAN: Can't believe that happened. I can't believe that... 943 00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:55,693 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Shh. Thank you! &gt;&gt; MAN: Thanks, Officer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See, Bruce? Now you know what it's like to get a DUI. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, no, no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, no, no, no. I didn't get a DUI. See, I had not been drinking. I had one beer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, well, Bruce, you're not the only one that got in trouble. Mom got herself in trouble, too, and this too-hot-for-TV clip is really crazy. Mom walked in to the craziest 953 00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,251 situation ever at my house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. What just happened? She just saw you naked? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And you're not freaked out? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, I mean, she's probably never seen anything like this before. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is going to be so awkward. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now, that's what I call hot! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't even look at that. It's like, I was traumatized. Oh, my...! Oh, my...! : Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a hot sausage. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But she told me she had a smile on her face. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She did? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She did. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no. Now I get Kourtney's attraction. Now I'm getting the... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's even weirder. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, okay, seriously, guys, enough about Scott and his sausage. Now I want you guys to check out some never-before-seen footage. Kourtney &amp; Kim baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A special sneak peek. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, you sneaky one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm scared already. &gt;&gt; KIM: You should be. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should be. Kourtney &amp; Kim Take New York: The Kardashians are here! So I'm excited to be single and do whatever the hell I want. Mr. West is in the building. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MAN: Stand by. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going to be the next soap opera star. &gt;&gt; MAN: Action! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wouldn't have done anything if you wouldn't have done it first. I'm, like, the most known actor of my day. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Dream actually reached out to me about you recording a song or something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. The-Dream asked me to record a song. &gt;&gt; THE-DREAM: You ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm nervous. &gt;&gt; THE-DREAM: Calm down. Quit playing. &gt;&gt; KIM: when I say I'm 30, it's like the end of time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This could be the down-and-dirty party. We need a keg. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God! Suck on it! &gt;&gt; KIM: This store needs to be our signature look. &gt;&gt; MAN: We're slightly overbudget, meaning three times. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is not good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are about to find love. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm taking this ring and I'm proposing to her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys, we're getting married! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You lied to me, Kim. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I find myself not being able to control my anger. Stop it! These are definitely times that make me want to have a cocktail. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What were you doing, starting a fight? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I will kill you! &gt;&gt; KIM: Do something. I feel sotaken advantage of. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! Yay, Kim and Kourtney! Whoo! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah! New York! Cheers, Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just miss all the times we used to have before, and I think we need to get together more often like this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely. To us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are everybody's rock. You really are. And I just want to thank you for loving all of us the way you do. You're an amazing guy. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hug. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you so much. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lie after lie after lie. 1024 00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:32,110 It just sucks, like, when the good guy hurts you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love you. &gt;&gt; ROB: I love you. &gt;&gt; MAN: And, Lamar, you may 1028 00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:49,627 kiss your wife. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just overwhelmed, but overwhelmed with happiness 1032 00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:10,047 because my family just keeps on growing, and I feel so blessed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: As much I love all you guys, I want you guys to get out of my house, because now that I know all this dirt, I have to purify everything. But before I go... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get out of my house! Bye, bitches. 1040
