Keep fighting, y'all. Keep fighting, come on! &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom always complains that, you know, she's getting older, and her body isn't in shape the way it used to be, so I think Barry's Bootcamp is the 10 00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,629 perfect workout for my mom. &gt;&gt; STORM: We're gonna work on... &gt;&gt; STORM: What we're doing... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Yeah, I'm good. &gt;&gt; STORM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; STORM: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; STORM: All right? &gt;&gt; STORM: Push it up! Work it out. Work it out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can see why Kim and Khloe come to this class all the time. It's a really good workout. &gt;&gt; STORM: Chest and abs today. 20 00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,533 Chest and abs. You got to work 'em out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, you do? &gt;&gt; STORM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; STORM: That'd be good. Be great. &gt;&gt; STORM: Five, six, come on. Hit it now, hit it now, hit it now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think this is a little too much for me. I'm not a real class girl. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shut up. I'm trying to work out. &gt;&gt;

- &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Will someone tell me how to play? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He's gonna do that. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's what we're doing right now, okay? Five chips. Put in five chips. No. No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're like Hitler. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're a tyrant. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I am. &gt;&gt; KIM: Every Sunday night, we get together as a family and have game night, and tonight, Rob is teaching us how to play poker. All right, I'm gonna put in some of that... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you're trying to go high. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...some of that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you gonna call? &gt;&gt; ROB: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, and I'm calling you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have a flush. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Read 'em and weep. I won. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm in the money. &gt;&gt; ROB: There you go. &gt;&gt; KIM: I beat you all my first time at poker. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is really annoying when it comes to playing games. She's been like this ever since we were little kids. Next time you're not gonna be so lucky. 53 00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,724 &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. Time for bed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going out with the girls, and I feel like I look so big, and I need Spanks, and the dress is too short, and the shoes are all wrong... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and maybe a little too young. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You look fabulous, honey. Come on, don't give me this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I have, like, cellulite on my ass, my thighs are, like, protruding. I used to work out every single day, and now, ever since knee surgery, and I've gained 15 pounds, I'm feeling really sort of down on myself. Is anybody ever gonna tell me 67 00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:27,741 I'm sexy again? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're sexy, baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good boy! Yay, Mason! &gt;&gt; STORM: I'm here to train Kris. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; STORM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm Kourtney. &gt;&gt; STORM: Hi, Kourtney. I'm Storm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; STORM: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, Storm is here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; STORM: I'm good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. &gt;&gt; STORM: It's great to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; STORM: You, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks for coming over. &gt;&gt; STORM: Oh, my pleasure. My pleasure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So come on in. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing, honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Excuse me, Mason. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Go away. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna work out with Storm. Today I'm having Storm come over so he can train me at home in a more comfortable setting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why does she want a personal trainer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, have you seen the guy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just saw him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He is pretty cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's not hard to look at. &gt;&gt; STORM: All right, so, we'll just take it to the mat, and we'll focus on a couple areas at once. I'm trying to be gentle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; STORM: And then you're gonna grab right here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't have to worry about being gentle, honey. &gt;&gt; STORM: No? Okay. I'll make sure I'm more hands-on then. Getting that good squeeze right there. Good. Five, four... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm squeezing. &gt;&gt; STORM: The tushie is raised. It's evident. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Boy, I'd tell her to do that, and I'd be dead. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at her. She's good at thrusting. She's had how many kids? Storm... he has a sexy name, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Storm? Is a sexy name? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. Storm is just, like, a chaotic name. Yeah, take me by Storm. I didn't know she could even be that flexible. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Little do you know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Kris, come on. Ooh! &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, look at you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys. Look at me. &gt;&gt; ROB: First time you've ever picked up a knife. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, are you ready to play poker? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, you got chips and stuff? &gt;&gt; KIM: I got the same exact kit that you have. I loved winning at poker so much that I decided to host my own poker night. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, all right. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're gonna play Texas Hold 'Em. We'll have a buy-in of $100. &gt;&gt; ROB: The winner takes all the money. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Takes everything. &gt;&gt; KIM: The winner takes it all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good hand. Good hand. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's what they all say. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kourtney's first. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney? You got to go. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; ROB: You got to bet... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So what do I do? &gt;&gt; ROB: Bet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bet more of this? &gt;&gt; ROB: Just bet whatever you want to bet. Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My turn? &gt;&gt; ROB: You got to raise? &gt;&gt; KIM: You want to raise? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, I'm gonna raise. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I felt a bug. &gt;&gt; QUINCY: All right, show your cards. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I have a straight-- five, six, seven, eight, nine. Ah-ha! You lost, I won! &gt;&gt; CARLA: Oh, my... &gt;&gt; KIM: First hand. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here comes competitive Kim again. She's the biggest gloater, and the sorest loser. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm actually gonna fold. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's 'cause you know I'm playing this round. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going all in. Who else is afraid to lose to the big, bad Kourtney? Everyone read it and weep, suckers. Are those mine? No. &gt;&gt; OTHERS: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They will be soon. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause you folded, you little... &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Stack your chips up. That's messy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have to admit, it's pretty satisfying to see the look on Kim's face when she loses. &gt;&gt; QUINCY: Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, your turn. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the ... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll bet four. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I got this hand. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you're so sure of yourself, let's make it interesting, 'cause I'm sure I'm gonna win. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sure I'm gonna win. So what's the bet then? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have to take off all your clothes and run around the whole house naked. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not doing that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: One of you should be one of yours bitch boy for the whole entire day. Has to do whatever the other person asks for. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, are you fine being that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, are you fine being that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you're fine being the boy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm fine, 'cause I'm winning. Okay, ready to be my bitch boy? &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, put your cards down. Oh, &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have three of a kind. &gt;&gt; KIM: Actually, you have a full house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So is that better? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, read 'em and weep... sucka! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Looks like somebody's the big butt bitchler boy for the day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Quincy, kill it! &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I'm done. You win. Fine, you win this one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Heapin' rain on them ho's. 174 00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,334 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, 'cause that's how people are doing it. &gt;&gt; STORM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! How are you? &gt;&gt; STORM: I'm great. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Having Storm around with his great energy's really motivating me to get back in the game. &gt;&gt; STORM: So, how have you been feeling? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a little sore. So that's a good thing, but not too sore. &gt;&gt; STORM: That's good. Just as long as you can sit down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I can sit down. So, what have you been doing? &gt;&gt; STORM: Working nonstop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What a waste. You should be out with the hottest girl in town; honestly. &gt;&gt; STORM: Well, I mean, do you want to be my publicist? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Digging for dates-- that's what I'll do for you. &gt;&gt; STORM: Digging for dates? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Digging for dates. Storm is really a nice guy. I think it's a shame he doesn't have a girlfriend. &gt;&gt; STORM: I trust your taste, certainly, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You do? &gt;&gt; STORM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One of the girls from BG5, the band I manage, is single, and I think her and Storm would make a really cute couple. That's her right there. How cute is she? &gt;&gt; STORM: She's very cute. What is this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's my new keyboard cover. Isn't it great? It's, like, you can do-- look what it does. It's just fabulous. &gt;&gt; STORM: Oh, yeah, I see. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. It's, like, a little accessory. Okay, let's go get a snack. &gt;&gt; STORM: All right, let's do it. I'd say it's about time to get a good snack in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; STORM: Is there a special ingredient or... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, we're gonna do this oatmeal. &gt;&gt; STORM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause it's healthy. I'll just make you a little snack. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, are you making Storm oatmeal? &gt;&gt; STORM: Oatmeal with blueberries, 'cause he's hungry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think she's ever made me the, uh, oatmeal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She never makes me anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's batting her eyelashes at him like... : "Oh, my God, I love your hair." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't worry. I trust my wife. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The guy's hitting on you big-time. I mean, just admit it. I don't want my wife fooling around with some young kid, okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sit down here on your knees and feed me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not gonna get on my knees and... feed you. Let's do it, one more hand of 225 00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,815 poker, ten grand. Are you scared? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Masey! Masey! Masey! Masey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where is Kim? I set out all this food to make me breakfast. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You can't make it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, come on! I'm hungry! I have a whole fun day in store for Kim. She's gonna be my little bitch, and she's gonna love every second of it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Finally, the princess has arrived. &gt;&gt; KIM: What would you like, dear? You even set it out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think you need to get a little bit excited about this day you're about to have. huevos please. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And make them extra ranchero. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I will not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's the bet. Don't be a sore loser. We don't like sore losers in this house. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am not a sore loser. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You've got to put on a happy face, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so not looking forward to being Kourtney's bitch. This is gonna be awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look me in the eye and memorize every chore that I'm giving you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I can't really look at you in the eye when I'm making you breakfast. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I earned this right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You won, fair and square. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't make a bet that you can't live up to. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bottom line, baby! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bottom line, baby, baby! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna go feed Mase.Y: I'm gonna go Keep that smile on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This was a mighty fine breakfast you made here. 257 00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,828 but... it's still good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here's all your clothes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know you're not giving me my clothes like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? You said, "Wash my clothes." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, wash and then fold them and then put them away, like you would want yours put away. This is not how you would ever fold your own clothes. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I know I agreed to this, but I think Kourtney is really taking advantage of this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Chop-chop. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was just beginner's luck. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Smile, Kim. Put a big smile on your face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so hungry. And excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, this ought to be interesting. Getting involved in Storm's social life is, well, it's not for me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, Storm, baby! &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you, doll? &gt;&gt; STORM: Fantastic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good to see you. This is Noreen. &gt;&gt; NOREEN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's Storm. get roped into this? &gt;&gt; STORM: Uh, it is my birth name. &gt;&gt; NOREEN: That's awesome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Noreen just finished two songs. &gt;&gt; STORM: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's very talented. &gt;&gt; STORM: Yeah, I've heard some of your stuff. &gt;&gt; NOREEN: You have? &gt;&gt; STORM: It sounds very nice. Yes. &gt;&gt; NOREEN: How often a week do you train? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Four or five days a week? &gt;&gt; STORM: As often as we can. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Lately all we've been doing is stretching. We stretch and stretch. &gt;&gt; STORM: We've been doing a lot of stretching. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Storm has barely said two words to Noreen. I don't know what's going on, but maybe he's just a little nervous. &gt;&gt; NOREEN: So, you guys do, like, an hour and a half or an hour or something like that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know, we just go and go and go, right? &gt;&gt; STORM: Yeah. Till we can't go anymore, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. It's crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This Storm guy has got a lot of guts. I mean, here we set him up with a date, he winds up kind of hitting on my wife here and talking to her the whole time. I don't know what the story is here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's to the blind date! Yay! &gt;&gt; NOREEN: Yay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where's your butler bitch with dinner? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, she better hurry, 'cause I'm so damn hungry. Smell this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I would rather not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just smell it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm ready for dinner from the butler; I don't want to smell that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's not even cooking. Kim only has a few hours left as my bitch dog for the day, and as her last chore, I'm having her make dinner for Scott and I. Well, what happened to a nice home-cooked meal? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is better than a home-cooked meal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We'll be sitting here waiting to be served. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Butler. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The table isn't even set. We'd like some candles, please. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I would take a diet cream soda. &gt;&gt; KIM: Coming. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll have three ice cubes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need soup in a bowl, please, and food on a plate, and you're eating before we are? And tin foil? Candles. Candles. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, look at this. Now she's coming together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Will you cut this, um, chicken for me, please, into little pieces. Bite-size. Will you cut my carrot, please? I can't eat a carrot that way. I'd appreciate you to sit down here on your knees and feed me some dessert. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, seriously, this is ridiculous. Now you're being disrespectful. You're taking it to a whole different level, and I'm not gonnaget on my knees and feed you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're not a sore loser. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, let's do it. One more hand, ten grand. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you scared? One more hand of poker for ten grand. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're just being ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're scared. I'm done. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm shivering. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good night! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Turn down my bed, please. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't believe she wouldn't feed you at least. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I would have done that 339 00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:41,047 for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The nerve. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, that was fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: For who? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that why you don't say one word on the drive home? Not one word. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, that's exactly it, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I get the silent treatment for what? What did I do now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is supposed to be Noreen's blind date, and the guy's hitting on you big time. The only person I could talk to was Noreen. I mean, just admit it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Admit what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Admit the guy was hitting on you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The guy was not hitting on... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, you were just loving it and soaking it up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The guy wasn't hitting on me. He's just a really nice guy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! Please! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He came there to be with Noreen. He winds up talking to you the whole time, and you're just encouraging this thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Encouraging this thing? Are you insane? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't be smiling. Don't be laughing. This is actually not funny. What, is this part of the whole menopause thing-- you start hitting on younger guys or what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what, Bruce? You... That's just really going way too far. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want my wife fooling around with some young kid, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You really need to reevaluate your social skills. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not my social skills I'm worried about. It's yours. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you mad that you were my bitch dog yesterday? &gt;&gt; KIM: She had no idea how to play poker, and then she wins. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not standing here to be ignored. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's really mad at you. Noreen called me and she said, "All Storm does is talk about you." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys should not be working out. 374 00:15:56,656 --> 00:16:00,126 You're married, and you have a crush on him. 376 00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:10,002 378 00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,038 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Noreen. It's Kris. &gt;&gt; NOREEN: Hello. How are you? 381 00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,609 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm good. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. I'm so excited. I had fun with you and Storm the other day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why was it interesting? What's that mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, great. Storm is talking about me on his date? I hope Bruce isn't right. Storm's a great trainer, he's really a great guy, but this honey. A child with a crush. That's just what I need in my life right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna make some oatmeal. Do you want some? Hello? You're cruel. 394 00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:06,259 Are you mad that you were my bitch dog yesterday? You're such a little brat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. What's going on? What are you doing that for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim's ignoring me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: She's mad that I made her my bitch dog yesterday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She was my bitch dog. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's a bitch dog? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She had to do whatever I said. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nightmare. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, that's funny. You were a bitch dog. &gt;&gt; KIM: She had no idea how to play poker. She just comes in, wouldn't even listen to the rules, and then she wins, and thinks that, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not standing here to be ignored, so I'm gonna go start my day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's really mad at you. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was just beginner's luck. She doesn't know how to do it what she's doing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, beginner's luck. Listen to yourself. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a game. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get over it. She's just rude. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to get over it. Look at the two of you. You're behaving like you're... like in grade school. Come on. You're such a competitive control freak. You would drive all of us crazy, so it doesn't become fun 422 00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:10,489 anymore. All right, I really have to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, you have the cutest clothes. Where's that striped dress that I wanted to borrow? Oh, this one. Is this it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you don't borrow. You take. You never give anything back. You're not allowed to take things until you bring things back. That's our deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I borrow some lipstick? Please? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Noreen called me, and she said, "All Storm does is talk about you." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who knows? He could have a crush on you. You're a bad mama jamma. I don't think you should... &gt;&gt; KRIS: So do you think it's weird that he has a little crush on me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have the crush on him, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. He, actually, I think, has a crush on me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Regardless. If you both do. I know you have a crush on him, too, you think he's hot, you think it's funny, da, da, da, da. But you guys should not be working out with each other if one or the other has a crush on someone. That's inappropriate. You've married, he's young. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. You're right. Now I feel really bad, because I don't think I would really like some young girl, who is a trainer, around all the time, flirting with my husband. We just work out, and have fun, and that's it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not just it. Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a really busy girl these days, Khloe. I don't have time for nonsense. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hope you wear Depends when you work out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi, babe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just looking at some videos. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is it porn? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just wanted to tell you, I was sorry about the whole Storm thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You were? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You didn't act sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I feel bad. I mean, it was just... It's just, the whole thing is so stupid and silly. And I can't say that for five minutes I didn't feel, like, flattered that somebody was paying me some attention. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I appreciate you apologizing, 'cause it really upset me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've made the decision not to train with Storm anymore. I have the most fabulous husband who gives me that kind of attention all day long. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Storm did work. You've been looking pretty good, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not do... No, I'm not do... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, you've been looking pretty good. Yeah, come on, let's do like we used to when we were young. Way too long ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Remember when we did it on a plane, and we turned off the engines? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: In the airplane. Yeah, that's right, that's right. While we were flying along. I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. All right, I'm getting horny, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Those were the old days-- that was the real Mile 479 00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,464 High Club, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ALL: Mason! Mason! Mason! Mason! Mason! Mason! Mason...! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's gonna get scared. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone's coming over for game night. I promised myself it's not gonna be about being competitive, not about winning or losing. I'm just gonna have a good time with my family and not care. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The category is places. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um, you see this sign on a door that you go out of... there's a sign... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exit. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. Here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, what do you use to sew? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Needle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not on our team, but thank you. Oh. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look here, Masey. Um, okay, so when we go to class, what is another name for class? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Education. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, where do you go every day? &gt;&gt; KRIS &amp; KHLOE: School. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, the last word is school, but it's two words, and so, the first word is... It's like, um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: High school. &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh! &gt;&gt; ROB: You don't want it in your hands. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's Kim's fault that your team lost. &gt;&gt; KIM: It doesn't matter. We don't have to keep score. We're just playing for fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to do this again for $10,000. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Are you imitating me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My God, they did a repeat of my chorus, eh? $10,000. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to do this for $10,000. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: $10,000? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Life is just a game. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 10,000 smacks for the loser. Four, five. &gt;&gt; KRIS: $10,000? &gt;&gt; KIM: Five, six. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are they doing to Mama? Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; Miles Austin wanted to get set up with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? Then we kiss and we revive. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys down to do Dash New York? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know I'm going to Europe with Lamar. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll be there for you 90% of the time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If I'm the only one who's willing to sacrifice, is it worth it? 525 00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,500 &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna close Dash Calabasas?
