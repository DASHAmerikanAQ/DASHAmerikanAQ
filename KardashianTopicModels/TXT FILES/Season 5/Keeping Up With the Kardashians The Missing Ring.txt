- &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, Jimmy... &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've just dropped me off. Have you ever been here before? &gt;&gt; JIMMY: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is the Taj MaKris. I've known Jimmy Myles since I met Kris, and, uh, never been over to our house. I'm kind of excited to show him all the stuff... that isn't mine. Now, here's the main area that Kris designed. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Mm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is Kris's gym. This is Kris's suite. A, uh, nude shot of my daughter, Kourtney. Why have that in here? &gt;&gt; JIMMY: It's, uh, it's art. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is it art? &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is where the great Kris, uh, mind works. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: I was going to say this is your office because... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's all my office. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Kris's. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. This is the laundry room, and you can see right there is my stuff. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Next to the dog. That is... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, buddy. And my garage, she says she's me. So, I'm kind of excited about it. I mean, that is my space. My little man cave. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Do you get a little doggy bed and a bowl of water, also? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, that's rented-- the laundry room. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it's in the laundry room, not too good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, yeah. We'll be back. We have to go to freakin' Kris Jenner's to look at her ...damned garage. &gt;&gt; KIM: Her garage. What is so exciting about a garage? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who freaking knows? Who knows? I mean, seriously, why the do we have to go see this? Maybe this is what Mom is doing for Bruce because look where he lives. Oh, my God, where the hell is my ring? &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm... I must have forgot it at the house. I gotta turn around. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I must have left it, like, when I was, like, washing my face or something. Like, it's a routine-- like, I'll wash my face, brush my teeth, I just put it right back on. &gt;&gt; KIM: You take your ring off to wash your face and everything, so it's probably right by the sink. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. That's so weird. Like, I remember I put it back on after I washed my face, and then I went downstairs and I was waiting for you. Oh, my God, Lamar's car is here. He cannot see me ringless. He'll freak out. &gt;&gt; KIM: We'll find it, don't worry. I promise. &gt;&gt; Kim Kardashian's in the house. &gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; Come in here. Come here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I gotta go upstairs and wash my face, okay? Mwah. Okay. &gt;&gt; Toodles. &gt;&gt; Toodles. I lost something. Oh, my God. This is where, like, I always set my jewelry when I wash my face, up here, so it can ever fall in the sink, and nothing's there. My ring is always in the same spot, now it's not. Now I'm freaking out. I have never spent longer than five minutes without my ring on my finger. This is freaking me out. I gotta to go look in more 67 00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,480 places. &gt;&gt; My, God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're gonna kill me, but I don't want a quesadilla anymore. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just making you this quesadilla, and now you're saying you don't want it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna eat the quesadilla. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'd rather have macaroni and cheese. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honestly, you're the most annoying person, I can't even say it; there are no words. Honey, can we do this so we can move on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I'm just cleaning this up, man. I want to see that garage. Today is the big day-- the unveiling of the garage. I just hope that it's got a place for all my stuff. Hit it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you guys, you're so impatient. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's so dramatic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, here you go. One... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God, it's a garage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Two... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a garage. Open it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Three! I'm so excited! Ta-dah! Oh, my God, could you die? This is like my dream come true. I mean, just, it's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Water... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's fabulous. It's every single thing has a place. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Looks like a refrigerator. Actually, that's cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This place is gorgeous and it makes me feel really good to drive in here and see this beautiful thing with not one speck of dirt or crap anywhere. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, it's great. She did a great job. Not quite the way I would've done it. Look at this. I mean, this cabinet. Nice cabinet, but look how big it is, how wide it is. So when you're pulling your cars in here, you gotta pull the car right up to this door just so the back end doesn't hit when the garage door comes down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, stuff like that. No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you love it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm gonna start working on getting my stuff in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Great. Now Bruce is gonna bring all of his junk back into this gorgeous garage and get it all dirty again after all of my hard work. My God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I look in these drawers, or you think there's some pornographic evidence in here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I already looked in those drawers. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here it isn't! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, why would you do that? It's not funny. Seriously. Hello? Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nothing. What's going on? I really can't talk to you now. I'm freaking theout. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, are you coming over here or not? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I can't worry about your garage right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Icannot find my engagement ring. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You lost your ring? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to die and Lamar's downstairs and I don't know what to say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does this mean you're not coming over? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what? I'm done talking to you. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, seriously, Khlo, it's gotta be here somewhere. You keep on looking. I have to go to an appointment. Make sure that you for sure lost it before you bring him with this drama in the middle of playoffs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really don't want to freak Lamar out in any way, so I'm gonna agree with Kim until I find my ring. I do not want to upset Lamar at a time like this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Trust me, I'm gonna go. Keep looking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just stay and help me look. Oh, my God, I'm gonna die. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa! Perfume. Hmph! This is ridiculous. Out of this big house, I've been confined to the small little place in the garage, and now she's putting her stuff in there? Honey! Where's Mom? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She just left. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She just left? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I come back into the house, and the snake Kris has snuck out! She's afraid to confront me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cleaning my helicopter off. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why are you in here cleaning it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mom, uh, kicked me out of the garage, so I gotta clean this thing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's not fair. That's like your space. Your little cave. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So why don't we, like, take over some of her space? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This could be good. If I can't put it in the garage, all my stuff, maybe I should just scatter it around the house. : Let's go do it. I like that idea. Just leave that one right there. 159 00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:29,015 She'll love it there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ooh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris absolutely loves her office, and, uh, I think it's time to take it over. I'm going to use this as my new garage. We should leave her with just my stuff in here. Perfect. When Kris comes home, look out! I know, I'm just going dump the golf balls out. Excellent idea. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Son of a bitch. Bruce! You put amotorcycle in my house?! Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's here, she's here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've lost your mind, so pick it all up, little boy, and go home. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just getting sick and tired of all of this. 175 00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,336 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall? Are Mom and Dad okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Son of a bitch. Bruce! You put amotorcycle in my house?! Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm in my office. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, psycho. What the hell? You've lost your mind, so pick it all up, little boy, and take your toys and go home, okay? And what, you don't... This is my stuff. You're in my space. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're in my space in the garage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not. I built that garage, okay? I do not want to negotiate for space in the garage that I designed. As far as I'm concerned, he can store all of his toys in the shed in the backyard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fifty-fifty. I get half the garage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, 90-ten. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, not 90-ten. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You get your corner of the garage. I wasn't even going to give up that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not 50-50! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I get half the garage; you get half the garage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, 25-75. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I'm holding firm on this one. There is a time in life when you got to really put your foot down, and this is the time, and this is the place, and I'm holding my feet to the ground. Fifty-fifty! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just get the motorcycle out of my damn entry, and you can have... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 50-50-- say it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Fifty-fifty. Just go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, yes! Kendall, you're a witness. You heard it. Give me five! Come on, let's get out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you guys are 206 00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:46,820 like toddlers. Take your mess with you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What you doing, mama? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nothing. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What you looking for? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not looking for anything. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I thought you was... What you looking for? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you looking for? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Give me a kiss. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, another one. I'm really not happy about kind of misleading my husband, but if it buys me some time until I find my ring... I just don't want to stress him out. There's no need to. I know it's here somewhere. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'll be right back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where you going? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm going to go play with Rob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: My brother-in-law. My brother-in-law! &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: My whole house is turned upside down, you guys. I think you forgot something, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. My heli? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. First of all, your motorcycle is not going to be parked there, because I can't get into my cupboards. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What, are we negotiating space now? This is my half. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, we are. Apparently, we are. If Bruce thinks that he can trash this garage like he did the last one, he's got another thing coming. I can't climb over this in... in Louboutins. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, here's the deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not going to do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We talked about 50%, didn't we? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is five percent of my 50%. Not too often do I really get angry, but this is the time. I'm like a dog marking my territory, and the garage is my territory. You've taken over this whole house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. No, it drives me nuts. I mean, look at... look at my whole life. First I had a great house in Tahoe, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: "We have to get rid of that house. We can't have it in Tahoe. All my friends go to Aspen!" I had my Porsche that I bought from winning the Games. I had it for almost 20 years. Boom! Get rid of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have a little respect for how much work and effort I put in to making my home beautiful for my family, okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just getting sick and tired of all of this. I live here, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce will not even listen to what I have to say. Well, you know, forget it. You can have your stupid garage. You've lost your mind, so if you like this garage so much, guess what-- you can live here and sleep in this garage. This little space is now your... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, this little space right here is bigger than the apartment I lived in San Jose. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, then, good. You should be very happy here. Enjoy it. You're sleeping there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I wonder if the apartment's still available. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm in here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are Mom and Dad okay? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just walked into the garage, and they're, like, screaming at each other. Dad was, like, yelling about his helicopters, and Mom was, like, taking over the house and... this is, like, his garage. What happened? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I mean, she had the entire garage. He only wanted one little area, and Mom didn't give it to him, so I felt bad. So I told Dad that he should, like, take all his stuff and put it in the house. I was expecting it to be more of, like, a funny thing, and I think Mom took it a little too seriously. I feel like I should, like, go down there and say something. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I wouldn't do that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, it's that bad? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. It's really bad. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's not good. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo. &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe is an idiot. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What happened? &gt;&gt; ROB: I just found this in the laundry load. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Whoa... &gt;&gt; ROB: This was in... this was in the washing machine. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Wow. Where did you find this? &gt;&gt; ROB: It was right in there. Just the load that I just put in there. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Was it in her clothes or, like, in... &gt;&gt; ROB: It was, like, in the sheets. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: In the bottom? &gt;&gt; ROB: And it just fell out into the washing machine. I heard a little clink or... clinky, clinky. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Wow. Wasn't she, like, going crazy looking for something this morning? &gt;&gt; ROB: She was. She was looking around all day. She might not even know yet. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, right. Wouldn't you know if this wasn't on you? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, she knows it's not on, 'cause she was always like, "Hey." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Right? She was like, "Oh, hey. How you doing?" Just imagine if I came home and I was like, "Yo, Rob, have you seen my wedding ring?" You know, like... It's never like, "I don't know where it's at." Period. &gt;&gt; ROB: You got to discipline your woman. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. Did you guys already start? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Anybody say grace? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Done. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here you go-- I'll do it. Dear Lord, thank you so much for this food, and may it give great nutrition to our fearless leader, Kris Jenner, and her humble servants Kendall, Kylie and Bruce. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Amen. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Amen! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really funny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think this salmon is too dry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll show you some dry salmon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've had enough. I'm going upstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's great. He is being so childish. And he's going to, like, stand up for himself on this stupid level that... Is he walking in? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You talking about me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we're not talking about you behind your back, baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're talking about me behind my back, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. We're trying to sit together as a family and have dinner, and you're going to be a baby and say you're not going to eat it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm going to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Okay, Bruce is taking this battle to a whole nother level and I really starting to resent it. What are you looking at? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Setting up my air mattress in the garage. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You guys are fighting a lot and it's worrying me and Kylie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you worried about? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You and Dad are going to split up or something. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm setting up my air mattress in the garage. Will you put... Get Bella to bed. Get her in there. Get to bed. Everything's going to be fine. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'll try not to. Mom? Mom. You never answer when I yell for you. Maybe I should call you "Kris." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think "Mom" is good. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um, I just had something to say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You shouldn't be mad at Dad because he's not the only one that planned to do all that stuff he did to your house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am trying to say that I am sorry. And you guys are fighting a lot and it's worrying me and Kylie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you worried about? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Maybe you and Dad and going split up or something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, we're not splitting up. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But this, like, the worst it's been. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We've been married for 20 years. Everything's fine. People argue about stuff, you know. And I think in this case, it's about territory. It's going to be fine. I don't want you to worry about Daddy and I. I want you to be a happy kid. It makes me really sad that Kendall took all this guilt upon herself, and feels like it's her fault for all the drama about the garage. Everything is good. So stop blaming yourself, and come over here and give me a hug. Come on. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hugs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And go get ready for bed, okay? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. All right. Nothing's your fault. And you can't get stressed out, and you can't feel, like, guilty about anything, okay? Okay, that's it. My shoulder's numb now. That hurts. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's what I was aiming for. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I think I got to watch my weight. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I think I'm getting, like, a little pouch. &gt;&gt; ROB: How much do you weigh? 250? Or more? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: 240. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're not that bad. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hi, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; ROB: You got a manicure today, didn't you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Your hands look nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you guys staring at my hands? Stop. What? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No reason. You know what this blanket means? &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hey, Khloe, it's September 27. You want to hang out with me forever or what? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, please. Just give me a wedding ring, I'll say "I do," I promise. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You better always wear your wedding ring. &gt;&gt; ROB: I can't find my wedding ring, baby. Please don't be mad. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, that's what it is. That's why you're acting funny-- hiding your hands. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, where is it? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: So what happened? Did you lie? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was with Kim and I thought I, like... I don't know. Like, I took it off and... &gt;&gt; ROB: Listen to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sorry, I just need my ring. Where is it? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You're a liar... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not a liar. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: ♫ You're just a liar. ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not a liar. Where'd you find it? &gt;&gt; ROB: In the washing machine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up. Okay, give me back my ring. Thank you. Please. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No, you can't have, you can't have, you can't have. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? : Yes, it's mine. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You can't have. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Please. Please, can I have it? &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, okay. I'm not involved. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's not happening. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay. I'm married again. I'm so glad to have my ring back. I'm so glad everything's back to normal. Lying is not what you do when you have a husband. I will never lose it again, trust me. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Why would you even play around? 411 00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,706 Obviously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Never again. Sorry I lied. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You like black guys so much, your mouth tastes like 415 00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,980 barbecue. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know I can be a little stubborn and overbearing at times, but now I feel really bad, because Bruce hasn't come back to bed. And maybe I've gone a little too far with this. Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing here, honey, in my garage? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I was kind of lonely up there. I'm all by myself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Lonely? I know, that's how it works when you kick me out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, I hate it when we fight like this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I agree. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall and Kylie are upstairs really upset. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They asked me, "Mommy, are you getting a divorce?" Because we're fighting. I told them sometimes when you've been married for 20 years, things can get kind of heated and then... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. But it's all solved. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...everything is okay five minutes later. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll sleep out here in my little garage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, then I'll sleep out here with you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're going to sleep out here with me, honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's so sweet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kind of like camping in the garage. You know, we went through it. I held my ground. I got, you know, at least half of my garage. But the good news is here, you notice she apologized first? That means I won. You came in and didn't shut the light off. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ow! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not pregnant, are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to stay away from her. This is Kim's new bodyguard. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. Oh, my God, he's hot. I want to keep it professional.
