- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I washed the dishes already. Honestly, though, who needs-- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight, nine, ten, 11 12, 13, 14, 15, 16-- 17 spatulas? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you know what? She was at Williams-Sonoma and bought more today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna be in for a major shock. My mom asked me to come over and help her clean out her pantry. I knew going into this this would not not be some small of a job because she's such a hoarder. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's just like a memory. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You've a lot of memories. You have so many freaking napkins! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look how cute these are, though. These are cuter than all the other ones. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Then throw the other ones away. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need you to put that in the garage. This is... Khloe, you're just freaking me out! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm freaking you out. Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are these? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, cigarettes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just in case somebody comes over that wants to smoke. I just like to have something... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you have them hidden in a bread container? I am not 11 years old. Those cigarettes are not for guests. They're for you, Kris. You're just very nosy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And 100s are kind of a rare cigarette to have for, like, just the community. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every night I take a little break for myself and I have my little glass of wine and I sneak my little cigarette. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me ask you a question. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Huh? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this chicken right here... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...really like an important chicken or something? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What does it say on the back? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Wood plaque rooster. Made in China. 38 00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:32,292 39 00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:38,932 40 00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,369 &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I brought these by for you to sign for charity. All these bags. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Will you open them and I'll get 'em ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Kendall, you could be assistant, okay? Kim, tell me about your photo shoot with Justin. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, it was so much fun. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What shoot did you do? &gt;&gt; KIM: I did a shoot in the Bahamas with Justin Bieber. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How old is Justin? &gt;&gt; KIM: 16. During the shoot, Justin said, "Oh, I have a nickname for you." And I was, like, "What?" And he's, like, "Cougar." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does he have a crush on you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have a crush on him? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, Kim, do you have a crush on him? &gt;&gt; KIM: If only he was 18. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 18? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait. You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a cougar. &gt;&gt; KIM: How I'm a cougar? I'm not even 30 years old. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you're a cougar. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I am turning 30 this year, and I am freaked out. It's pretty old. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Kim Kardashian "Channels Her Inner Cougar With Justin Bieber." &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this a joke? &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Why They LOVE Their Prey So Young! &gt;&gt; KIM: That is so embarrassing. All of a sudden, I'm, like, linked in this category. It just makes me feel older than I already am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just the Internet. Don't read that stuff anymore. See you later, Grandma. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't worry, I'll get the dishes, guys. Don't worry. I'll clean 'em up. You guys just relax, okay? I got 'em. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Where's Mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She said she just went outside to go fix the waterfall. I didn't even know we had a waterfall. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom is totally having a cigarette right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Once a night, my mom sneaks out of the house and smokes a cigarette. My mom really doesn't know who she's messing with. We're gonna make her life a misery. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here, Masey! Come on! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, Mom, you reek so badly! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Of what? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Of cigarettes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Masey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you need to go shower. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not gonna shower every time I want to hold my grandson. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, then you're not gonna hold Mason. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're treating me, Kourtney, like a drug addict. What are you guys, the cigarette police? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And Kylie, Kylie, stop. Kylie, come on. Kylie, you're crazy. Stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just go take a shower and make 'em happy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Take a shower. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right, Mas? 93 00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:55,502 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so gonna get her to quit. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so hungry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yummy! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey! Can you help her, Mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Move the chair out, someone. Thanks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why do you give him that pacifier? It's hideous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When you have a baby, you will grab whatever pacifier you can find. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow, Mom! Ow! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look, look, that's a gray hair. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is not a gray hair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is a gray hair, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, you are in denial. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it Thanksgiving? 'Cause I can see a little gobble-gobble. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really, wrinkle eyes? You got a couple of creases there that are getting pretty deep, huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, 'cause I haven't done Botox like you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, you'd better start because stress really ages you. Like, major. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not even 30 yet. Lines on my face are just not acceptable. I totally would try Botox. So, like, I'm not opposed to it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so pretty. Do you see one wrinkle on her face? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, Mom told me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do I have wrinkles on my face? &gt;&gt; KIM: You could just fill in a little under your eyes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She doesn't need to do anything. You don't have wrinkles. You guys are all nuts. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait a minute. Look. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mmm! Ow! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, look. There's another. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would you pull that out of her head? &gt;&gt; KIM: Right over my food. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me see if you have any more. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim has a gray hair, Kim has a gray hair. 128 00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,858 &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you have 500. Your whole head is gray. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you just want to go, like, on a lunch date with me? &gt;&gt; KIM: On a lunch date? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, like, let's just go shopping, have lunch... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we can do that right after. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Today I'm going to my Botox consultation. I have a few questions for the doctor, and I want to hear what he has to say. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know why... you are even doing this. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's completely painless and harmless. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, the consultation. &gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM/KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KASSABIAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KASSABIAN: I'm Dr. Kassabian. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KASSABIAN: Hi. Dr. Kassabian. Welcome to Lift. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So... so, you see these, like, little lines right here? &gt;&gt; KASSABIAN: Yeah, that's very common. If you don't mind me asking, how old are you now? 19? &gt;&gt; KIM: Bitch. You're good. I'm 29. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are good. &gt;&gt; KASSABIAN: 29? The more you wrinkle, the more the skin thins out and the fat between it thins out... &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe really needs it, too, and she's in denial. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't need it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have wrinkles. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, what are the side effects? &gt;&gt; KASSABIAN: Serious side effects are extremely rare, but the benefit outweighs the side effects. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we'll start with Botox, and we'll see where this 159 00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,637 takes us. &gt;&gt; KASSABIAN: Fantastic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Having a glass of wine. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wine first. Then... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Then comes... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Cigs! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are making me sound like I have a problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. 'Cause you do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Actually, I don't. I don't need to smoke cigarettes every time I have a glass of wine. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Then don't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So don't. Yeah, don't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys don't think I could stop smoking for a week? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nope. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Starting tomorrow, I'll show you that I don't need to have a cigarette for a week. Or maybe even a month, okay? I'll show you guys that I can have a little more willpower than you guys think. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You show us. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Whatever you say, Krissy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are just beyond annoying. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Starting now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, starting tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If she's not gonna 180 00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,365 stop, let's, like, force her. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Let's go. 183 00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,874 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I got the door. Shh, shh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What in the hell are you guys doing?! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Did it put it out? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is messed up. You guys better start running for the hills. This isn't funny. Stop it. 190 00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,127 Kylie, that's enough. That is enough. I get it. Point taken. The cigarette's out, Kylie, okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your makeup looks nice like that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, looks really cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are really out of your minds. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She's out of her mind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've never met such a crazy freak. &gt;&gt; KIM: My eyes won't stop watering. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure it's just what happens after you get Botox. &gt;&gt; KIM: My eyes are on fire. Something is just not right. 202 00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,721 I need to get out of here. This isn't funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. What's going on with you? You look nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. I'm supposed to have lunch with Mom, and Mason's taking a nap. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That guy can sleep, can't he? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He can. Did Kendall tell you what we did to Mom last night? We, like, literally dumped buckets of water on top of her while she was smoking a cigarette. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Obviously it didn't work. I saw her smoking this morning. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This morning? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She doesn't even smoke in the mornings normally. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She was out on the porch. I could smell it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ew. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Seriously, Kris, what is it going to take to get you to quit smoking? 'Cause we're not going to stop until you stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's just a bad influence on Kendall and Kylie. I mean, that's what really bothers... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Totally a bad influence. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can do... You can, you know... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What if Mom thought her influence was rubbing off on you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What if she thinks that you're maybe smoking now because of her? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am not going to take a cigarette. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not wanting you to take a cigarette. I'm saying don't-don't like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stupid idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? I'm not telling her to smoke. They have those herbal cigarettes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want cigarettes even near these kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're not even real cigarettes. They're Honeyrose. They're, like, made out of honey and marshmallow. And you're not-- she's not really going to smoke it. She's just going to have it lit in her hand. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You think this is a good idea, huh? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think it would be a wake-up call for her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, that's true. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I mean, what else are we going to do to get her to stop? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. Try it. See what happens. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Should we go? Bye. 247 00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,692 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have fun. Good luck. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I cannot believe you dragged me along for this process. &gt;&gt; KIM: Moral support, baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but I don't support this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Today I'm going to try Botox just to get rid of my wrinkles. And once and for all I'm going to see what it's all about. Hi. We're here for my appointment. And hopefully it works and I have great results. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: I have some numbing cream if you want. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I can handle it. I have a really high tolerance for pain. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: I can handle it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're nuts. &gt;&gt; KIM: All my friends do it with no numbing cream. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: All right, you ready, Kim? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, she is. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm as ready as I'll ever be. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you sure? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yep. Shut up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Give me a big smile. Huge smile. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't move. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay, relax. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. This is disgusting. I hate needles. You're so stupid. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shut up, Khloe. It's rude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does it hurt? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Shut up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nasty. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Khloe, is this hurting you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, it is. I can, like, feel it going into my face. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, Khloe, just shut up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm almost halfway there. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Big smile. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, if Lars bald, can this go in the top of his head? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Some people are trying that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't even know why I brought Khloe along with me. I mean, she's making all this noise. She's freaked out about the needle. I just want her to, like, shut up and just be supportive. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: See? Wasn't too bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not too bad. Do I look younger? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Three to five days, sweetheart. &gt;&gt; KIM: Killed my buzz. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But if you feel it, that's all I want. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You'd better wait in the car, Kendall. Hi. Do you guys have any cigarette that don't have nicotine in them. &gt;&gt; CLERK: Yeah, we have the Honeyrose. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; CLERK: Free tobacco. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, so what's in them? Marshmallows, herbs, all kinds of stuff except tobacco. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. So if my sister wants to smoke it and she's, like, 14... Or is there not an age? &gt;&gt; CLERK: I wouldn't recommend anybody for 14 to smoke, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, okay. It's just, like, to make my mom stop smoking. 'Cause she... &gt;&gt; CLERK: For your mom, it's good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, like, I want her to think, like, she's making my sister smoke. &gt;&gt; CLERK: Oh, I get you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, I'll get these. &gt;&gt; CLERK: Anything else? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that's it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; CLERK: You're welcome. Have a good day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye. You, too. &gt;&gt; CLERK: Bye. 308 00:12:55,908 --> 00:13:00,513 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Got 'em, Kendall. Cigarettes at your service. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We've got the 311 00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,697 cigarettes. Let's hide this in here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not even a real cigarette. KENDALL: Eww! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, gross. Go in the backyard. I'll get Mom to go back there. Go. Go that way. Kendall, just go in the backyard 318 00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,313 with that thing-- it smells terrible. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WAITER: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KIM: Great. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Ladies, what can I get for you to drink? Iced tea, lemonade? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you have a cup of ice? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Of course. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm good. &gt;&gt; KIM: It just, like, itches, and I want to... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have to do exercises on your face. Remember, he said to keep smiling. Would you die if there was paparazzi? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you sure it doesn't look weird? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, when you do it looks weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know what to do. Like, my eyes won't stop watering. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure it's just what happens after you get Botox. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm making an ice pack for my eye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so dramatic. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I'm not so dramatic-- you don't even know what this feels like. Seriously. Something's wrong. This isn't right. The doctor did warn me about side effects from the Botox, but I am feeling like my eyes are on fire. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait about 15 minutes-- oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm a little worried for Kim, 'cause it looks like she's having a bad reaction. But I hate to say it, but I told you so. &gt;&gt; KIM: What if he hit a nerve? Seriously. I know this is not normal. What I'm feeling is not normal. I need to get out of here. Seriously, I need to go home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, let's skedaddle. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, this isn't funny. 350 00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:55,628 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, stop freakin' out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall? Kendall? Kendall, what are you doing? We have to go. Kendall, what is that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nothing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing, Kendall Jenner? And what is this?! What are you doing with these cigarettes! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nothing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What... Get in the house! Smoking cigarettes?! I'm gonna talk to your dad right now. Your father's gonna hear about this. Go to your room-- I can't even look at you right now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. 364 00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,571 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get to your room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to know what Kendall Jenner was just doing? She was smoking in the bushes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kind of like what you do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm allowed to do what I want. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's 14. I'm a hypocrite? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm totally bruised. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It looks like someone socked you in your face, Mike Tyson. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. I have bruises literally all over my face. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does it hurt? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, you want to know what Kendall Jenner was just doing, when I was gonna take her to cheer, which she's not going to because she's grounded for the rest of her life? She was smoking in the bushes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My little Kendall? Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hiding in the bushes, hiding. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kind of like what you do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm actually an adult, and I'm allowed to do what I want. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's 14. I'm a hypocrite? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Parents lead by example. By far the most important thing. Kids watch their parents, they watch what they're doing, okay? You're setting a really bad example for the kids, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It devastates me to think that my actions have influenced Kendall that much that she would be curious to find out what exactly it is that I might be feeling when I smoke a cigarette. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Absolutely, you're a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Khloe, is that you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're just relaxing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, yeah. I've got, like, a headache. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that your mascara on your face? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? I'm not wearing any makeup. I just washed my face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, but you-- it's, like, all black here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously? Don't freak me out anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, there's a little... &gt;&gt; KIM: Where? Are you holding it? 'Cause it's my life; don't drop it. I am totally bruised. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It looks like someone socked you in your face, Mike Tyson. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. I don't know how I'm gonna cover this up. I have bruises literally all over my face. Seriously, I'm gonna look like a clown. Oh, my God. 412 00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,299 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does it hurt? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So, Mom grounded me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I guess we didn't think that far ahead of... what would she do if she found you. Does she think for sure that you were smoking? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. She was, like, pissed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what she deserves. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kourt, I'll tell you later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Came in here to say that I'm really sorry that I lost my temper like that. But it just made me a little crazy just seeing you hold a cigarette. Made me mad at myself. You know, like, how stupid am I that that's, like, something that I would do to my own body? And how can I tell you not to do that when I'm doing the same thing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You wouldn't be trying to teach me a lesson, would you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Not at all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not at all? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so maybe Kendall wasn't really smoking, but I hated seeing her with that cigarette. And now I know how my kids feel when they see me smoking. It definitely scared me straight. Well, I don't want you to smoke just as much as you don't want me to smoke. I love you, and I want you to be around for a really long time, okay? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me a hug. I love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're squeezing my face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So cute. That's a cute little face to squeeze. Give me a kiss. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ew. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One little kiss? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ew. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please? Okay. And by the way, Kendall, you're still grounded. 447 00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,825 I'll let you know when dinner's ready. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Come in. I'm dying. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Well, we'll see if I can help. &gt;&gt; KIM: Dr. Vaisman is coming over. He's been our family doctor for a long time. I'm kind of embarrassed to tell Dr. Vaisman why I have bruises on my face. But I'd rather have peace of mind. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: This hurt when I push? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just, like, right around the little crow's-feet lines. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Near the nonexistent crow's-feet? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. That will be there one day and now I can never really get Botox 'cause I'm allergic. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Well, I'm not so sure that you're allergic, but I think that anytime you get an injection under the skin, it can cause some bruising. And I think that's what you've had. But you got to be careful. You never know what kind of reaction you're gonna have to medications or injections, so... You do them if you need to, and you certainly don't need to. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: It'll heal up. You'll look good as new in a week. So you hide out for a couple days behind your glasses. &gt;&gt; KIM: It'll be, like, my new trademark. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you do it? How do you wave like that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Got to go like this. This is how the princess waves. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like this? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Have you seen Princess Diaries? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm a professional waver. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your wave sucks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been in many a parade. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, you guys, look what I got. This is my first day on my nicotine gum. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! Does your breath smell like tobacco? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's kind of like a cigarette and a glass of wine rolled up into one little package. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Congrats, we're proud. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, congrats. Everybody, let's have an applause for mom. Yes, let's all give her an applause. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: As Bruce would say, hoo-yah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm so proud, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Make me feel even worse. Make me feel even worse. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not as bad as Kimmy said. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not that bad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It looks like a cartoon version of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's exactly what you look like, a cartoon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, look at you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: With the big cheeks. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll never do this again, ever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, promise? &gt;&gt; KIM: Never. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Promise? &gt;&gt; KIM: Promise. When I looked in the mirror and saw how bruised and swollen my face was, I cannot believe that I put myself through this. I will never do this again. Well, at least until I'm, like, 40. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I cannot tell any difference. You were beautiful before and you're beautiful now. &gt;&gt; KIM: And you're old and you can't see. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's all right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'm gonna go chew my cigarettes now. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rocky's getting neutered. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's the deal with you girls? &gt;&gt; VET: We do have neuticles. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is a boob job for a dog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My wish would be to get the hell away from her family. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Living in New York is something that I've considered. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you moving to New York? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just uncomfortable that I have to live two lives. 523 00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,532 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not gonna kiss your ass just to get you to stay
