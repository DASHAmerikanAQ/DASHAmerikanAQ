- &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Oh, hi! &gt;&gt; LALA: Hey! &gt;&gt; KIM: Happy birthday to you. &gt;&gt; LALA: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Brittny and Lala are my best friends. They are the girls that I go to when I need advice on anything. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Have you spoken to, um, Reggie? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. I just-- it's so weird. Everyone just, like, looks at me like, "It's really over?" Like, you guys can't believe... &gt;&gt; LALA: We always believed that somehow you guys were gonna get back together. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: So it's legit, 100% over? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's 100% over. &gt;&gt; LALA: Okay, this is the Lala/Brittny holy grail. Put your hand on it and tell us it's over. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is over, girls. I'm officially single. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: All right, well, someone reached out to me... &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: ...that they wanted to get set up with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: What does he do? &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: He plays football. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. That's too close for comfort. Dating another football player would just be, you know, really uncomfortable and awkward for me. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: So maybe you check the situation out and you're even interested... &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, let me Google, let me Google. 26 00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,939 Okay, what is his name? &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Miles Austin. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's cute. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: But supposedly he's a really good guy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, his eyes are really pretty. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: He looks like A-Rod. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, should I have you give him my number? &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: What do you have to lose? &gt;&gt; KIM: God, their bodies are so amazing. &gt;&gt; LALA: Amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just love, like, feeling a really strong body lift you up. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: That's what I said. &gt;&gt; KIM: The football player position. I'm just kidding. Every girl that has dated a football player, they all have sex the same way. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Right. &gt;&gt; LALA: That's funny. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Try it out, see how it goes. 43 00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:53,547 44 00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,220 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Kris, it's Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. What's going on? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, nothing much. Is Bruce around? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, hold on a second, okay? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott's on the phone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just don't want to talk to him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? What does he want? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just tell him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You tell him. Get on the phone. It's rude. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I'm just leaving to go play golf. He just, he just ran out the door. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, he just ran out the door to go to the golf course. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, all right. Would you just make sure to tell him that I called and tell him to call me back? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I'll tell him. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have a good day. Why don't you want to talk to Scott? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He wants to hang with me. And the problem is, I can't get over all the things in the past. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. Scott! &gt;&gt; WAITER: I can't get you a... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Shut your... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe he's trying to turn his life around, but you know what, I just don't forget all that stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't blame you. I wouldn't want to hang with him either. But did you promise him you would take him somewhere? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't promise. He's the one, he was talking about maybe we can do that, he wants to get a motorcycle, you know, go riding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, you do this to yourself. You always tell somebody that you're gonna do something and then you don't... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I did not say I was gonna do something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now I have to do your dirty work and tell him that you're not here. I've got a lot of things to do. 83 00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,898 I'm a little busy, and now I'm going back to work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This floor was not made for high heels. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I know. Most people don't design their garage floors around high heels. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're here. Kourtney's been in New York City, and she invited Kim, Khloe and I to lunch today, and she says she has some news for us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I was in New York, and I ran into a friend who's a realtor, and we've been talking about opening a Dash. I spent the entire day one day, just, like, took Mason-- we looked at everything. Expanding Dash has always been a dream of ours. I think New York City is the next logical place where we would love to open a store. I spoke to our business managers to ask, is this even an option? Can we afford it? And they said they think it's a fantastic idea. So are you guys down to do Dash New York? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is a dream come true. What are you even talking about? &gt;&gt; KIM: For sure, we're in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's no question. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When we opened Dash Calabasas... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Back to getting on our hands and knees and scrubbing the tub... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me, you and you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, Kim and I-- when we started, we just opened a small little boutique in Calabasas, just, like, to keep us closer together. Our father passed away; we wanted to do something where us sisters could bond and always come back to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So now is the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 100%! Amen, sister. You preach thatlike a hot mama. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kim is not gonna be pleased if you break that. Watch out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're gonna break it now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Idiot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Idiot? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What were you do... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Idiot? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know I only get my nice stuff done professionally. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Put blush on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You are one weird chick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just let me do it to you once. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want your son's father to wear makeup and lip balm and lip gloss? You're weird. Have you heard from Bruce at all? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I figure we have a lot of similar interests, so why not hang out together and have some kind of bond? I've tried to call him, I've tried to reach out to him. He doesn't respond, he never calls me back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's so Bruce. He just, like, he doesn't even look at his cell phone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All I wanted to do was try to go do something that he likes, but I can't get ahold of him to do anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wouldn't take it personally. Bruce is Mason's grandfather, and it only makes sense that Scott wants him to like him and be accepted by Bruce. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And, you know, he's taken Lamar golfing. I know he's done things with Reggie in the past. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It sounds like Bruce is playing hard to get. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just trying to hang out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You, like, have a crush on him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I don't know a lot of great people, and I know that Bruce happens to be one. And I've made a lot of positive changes. And this is just one more thing that puts me on a nice path. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am all for it then. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh,yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come on, stop. Ow. 148 00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,808 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're gonna play with me, I'll play with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, I thought he was about to cry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look great. Oh, hi. Oh, this is a new look. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They forgot what size I am, and this is all that they could think of in my size. While Kourtney and Kim get to be in shorts and a miniskirt, I get to be in a kilt. Do you know how much bigger I look now that they're putting this on me? Mom, come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, at least they didn't make your outfit out of the drapes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to be in the drapes. Don'twith me, Mom. It's not the right time to tease. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's starting to dress more like Bruce and less like Scott. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, this is actually one outfit, and Scott actually is the one who dressed him this morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How is Scott doing? What's going on with you guys? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's the therapy thing going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. Every week, we always feel better after we go, and it seems to help us, like, resolve an issue. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's really cool. I mean, I'm proud of you guys. When Kourtney tells me that her and Scott are still working on their therapy, it's encouraging, because it makes me feel like maybe they have a chance. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: By the way, I heard that Bruce went golfing with Lamar and Rob or whatever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, they had a really good time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And Scott was like, "Bruce would never take me golfing," you know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce would take him golfing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, now Scott's been trying to call him; he won't call him back the last two days. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. I'll make sure Bruce calls Scott back. I feel really, really bad. Scott's really trying to improve himself. And, for Kourt's sake, I'm really gonna try to convince Bruce to go hang out with Scott. Bruce loves to go dirt-biking, and he might be a good role model for Scott. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Especially since Scott's dressing Mason like Bruce Jenner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, this has nothing to do with what he dresses like. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Can I get you anything to drink while you're deciding? &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I get a passion fruit ice tea, please? &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Passion? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll have the same thing. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: And bread while you're deciding? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. No. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: I'll be right back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want any bread. I want a chocolate cake, but I don't want any bread. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so I'm, like, really in a torn dilemma. No, like, seriously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Miles-- he's just the nicest guy in the world, and he's gorge'. Did I show you the pictures...? So I've been talking to Miles over the phone, and, um, I kind of like him. You know, he seems like a really cool person. Of course, I struggle with the fact that yeah, I don't want to date another football player, because I think it just makes me feel uncomfortable, and I think about, oh, well, if I go to a game, like, in the stadium, like, it'll be hard for me to go to a game. I'm not going to lie. And there are so many reasons why I don't want to like this guy, but he's a really nice guy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you're going to fly to Dallas for one night? &gt;&gt; KIM: For one night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim and Miles seem to really be hitting it off over the phone, so I figure, why not go to Dallas and see him? &gt;&gt; KIM: Should I say, "Will you pick me up from the airport?" Or should I get a car? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ask him to pick you up. 221 00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,597 He's going to love to pick you up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, you up here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm in the bedroom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bedroom-- ooh. So what went on today? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So here's the thing. No, so I went to the photo shoot for the girls, and I felt actually kind of bad, because I was talking to Kourtney, and she was telling me how hard Scott's working on himself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you felt bad? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're the only family that Scott really has right here, and he's lost, like... all of his friends are gone, because all the friends that he did have are drinkers and partiers, and he's really trying to be a better person, and you maybe could just take one for the team and go out and hang out with Scott a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you saying? Hang out with Scott? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, he's been reaching out to you. He doesn't have anybody else. He really doesn't. And the more I think about it, you know, I'm just feeling kind of bad because Kourtney's just asking for our support and our help. You have to remember that we have a grandchild, and this is Mason's dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll do it for Kourtney, and that's the only reason. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. That's a good enough reason. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why is it always me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because you're a good sport and you'll do the right thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. 247 00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,930 I'll do something with him. But I'm going to kick his ass. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This driveway is not... I'm telling you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's like I'm navigating a minefield. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, but now you told me, "The driveway's not made for girls with heels." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, but now I have heels on, so now it matters. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: You know, that's the one that, you know, I don't mind mulling it over a couple of... you know, for a couple days. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think Soho and the West Village. And I do love the Meatpacking. I just think maybe the ones that we looked at, 'cause they didn't have the air-conditioning and stuff, maybe weren't good, but again... &gt;&gt; KIM: No air-conditioning and no... we need to have a bathroom already installed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In New York, commercial real estate is outrageously expensive, but our Realtor just found a great deal on a property in Soho. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: We might have to act fast on this one. I don't want to be, like, pushy. If that is something you might want to go forward with, let me know, 'cause we're going to have to really jump on that one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you, Vince. I'll talk to you soon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, that was awesome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, it sounds good. We just need to act now and make a decision. &gt;&gt; KIM: If we need to act now, then we need to act now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is like going there for a month or two to get the store together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We could do that for a week, and then be done. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's like what we did in Miami. I mean, we had to get down there, and you guys said you were down to do this with me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I... I am. I didn't know that meant sometime in the next month. You know I'm going to Europe with Lamar. I can't... what do you want me to do? He's on the USA basketball team. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think all three of us need to be heavily involved in opening this store if we're going to make it work. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I can do it. I'm not doing anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I don't understand... because I want to do it. I don't understand why you just can't wait a couple months. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim's not going to have time, and also, we have to get the store open by the holidays. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why is it always based off of Kim's schedule? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not. &gt;&gt; KIM: None of the other stores have ever been based on my schedule. This is based on your schedule. You can't be there. We need to get the store, so I'll step in and do it. You should be, like, thankful that I'm going to actually help getting the store... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thankful? We all own the store. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, you should be excited that you don't have to bust your ass every single day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We ready to go here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can do that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you packing such ugly panties? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm heading to Dallas, so I'm just going to see Miles. 302 00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:51,504 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This looks like a piece of doodoo caca! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you packing such ugly panties? &gt;&gt; KIM: Shut up! I don't want to hook up with him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You do want to hook up with him, or else you wouldn't have just given yourself a ho bath, and now jumping on a plane in two seconds. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't wear nude underwear now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This looks like a piece of doodoo caca! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm heading to Dallas, and it's only for 24 hours, 'cause I have no time. My schedule's so hectic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're done. Let's go. Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just so good to have that feeling of, like, getting excited and wanting to see someone and wanting to hang out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're going to miss your flight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, your ass looks fine. I'm so tired of you staring at yourass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. Mommy will miss you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: On the road. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Temecula, here we come. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here we come. Finally, this guy Bruce calls me back, and we're going to go down to Temecula to go Trophy Kart racing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have you ever, uh, raced anything before? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've been in a race car, but never this Trophy Kart stuff that I've heard you talk about forever. I got to tell you, I feel like I've called you a bunch, and I feel like you never get back to me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. But I also... you know, I leave messages with Kris sometimes. She probably doesn't give them to you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She doesn't call me back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It looks like I'm going to spend more time with Scott today than I have in the last two years combined. How's the non-drinking going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's fine. I mean, my life is just much more manageable. A lot more is on my mind now, because I'm more clearheaded, but I've been dealing with it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But you're the type of person who just can't have a drink. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's the way I look at it from the outside. Just, like, no. Just go another direction. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, it's just not that important to me anymore. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are we going to run them? That one up there? &gt;&gt; CLERK: The track up there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Top one? 348 00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,859 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. Should we try to get out there? Bruiser. Come on, pop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's about as close as you can get. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on, Grandpa. There's nothing like a father-to-son outing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, we're not quite there on the son. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, my grandson's 356 00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,444 father-- how's that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's close enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can do that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sure. I admire Bruce, and it's not because of his athletic accomplishments, but that he's a great father and has always been there for his children. 362 00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,626 And it would mean a lot to me to be a little closer with him. 365 00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:38,004 We ready to go here? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ah! Ooh! My hair is really frolicking in this wind. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good run. That was fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you, too, Bruiser. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know how the hand hug goes? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The hand hug. Hand like that, thumb around. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thumb around. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's making me uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thumb around. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hand hug. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. I feel very close to you. Hand hug! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's weird, but I like it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I thought you would. You know, I've only really shared the hand hug with my family, but hey, Scott's getting in there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: See? We could do things like this more often. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I guarantee you if you take me to the golf range, maybe I could play golf. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I don't want to get that close. Hand hug is enough. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, hugger. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This seems like a nice little place. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it's cool. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Welcome to Lucille's. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just gonna have a beer. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Okay. And how about for you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll have a ginger ale. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How cute, ginger ale. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Happy life, happy wife. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. I'm impressed with Scott. He's really making some good positive changes in his life. And that's good. Hey, you did really well. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks, Bruiser. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like you think, that, like, I can't do anything active just 'cause I walk around in a suit all day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, that's... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I could put a T-shirt on and I can get out there. I wish you realize that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You start driving like that some more, and you can hang with the boys here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think I already did. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, you hanged with me. I mean, I got more boys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bring 'em out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, bring 'em out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'd love to meet them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm in. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, sounds good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm in! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Cheers. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're up here in the office. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. : Hey! Hey! Are you excited to see me?! I missed you! Oh, I missed you! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How was your trip? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, it was so much fun. Here, come here. I want to tell you all about it. I just feel like being in Dallas for only 24 hours just wasn't enough time. I want to see Miles again, I want to hang out with him more. It's just so good to have someone that you're just excited about again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, wait. So tell me everything. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was so random. And I was, like, "Okay, I know now he's gonna kiss me." And I was so nervous going because I knew it was coming. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I hate stuff like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. So, then we kissed, and it was just like we just, like, revived, you know what I mean? Like, it was a good kiss, and I was so relieved because I was so nervous to kiss him. I really like him. I mean, just the bad thing is he lives, like, all the way in Texas. It's like I'm getting into another long-distance relationship. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm excited for Kim that she's met someone that she's having fun with, but the last thing I need is for her to get distracted, and you know, not put all of her energy into the store. I just think how you just, like, took off and went to Dallas to hang out with Miles, like, what if he's, like, "I want to take you on vacation"? &gt;&gt; KIM: What, you think I'm gonna leave like Khloe left you to go see Lamar? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, a big job. I don't want to end up, like, "Oh, I have to do this all by myself." &gt;&gt; KIM: Dash will definitely be my number one priority. And I'll do what I can to be there as much as I can. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know how busy you get. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll be there for you 90% of the time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your version of 90, anyways, is just unacceptable. I need someone who's there and committed the whole time. I just can't do it by myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you so quiet? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just need to make a lot of decisions about Dash lately. &gt;&gt; KIM: We should do New York and move L.A. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't think I want to do either anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? You're going to 456 00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:34,306 close Dash, Calabasas? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I think so. 458 &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that cute, you think, or no? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruiser, you ready for the new suit? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys look like gangstas. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruce is a great guy, and I figured I'd like to do something nice for him. And I knew that a custom-made suit would really surprise him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here it is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, once in a while I got to go to work and wear a suit, and here's Scott showing up with a tailor. I love it. I mean, the guy does know how to dress. I will give him that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, go try it on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's see. I'm anxious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go up to Kim's room. Kim, can we use our room to do this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dressing is not a game, it's a lifestyle. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that what it is? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So that's cute that Scott got a suit for Bruce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you so quiet? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just need to make a lot of decisions about Dash. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's wrong with Dash? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't want to get to New York, have a lease signed, have merchandise ordered that we can't back out of, and then it's just me who has to do all the work. And then our lease is gonna be up at our Dash, Calabasas store. Do we want to keep these same... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are... &gt;&gt; KIM: But I said I'm in. Like, we can do, we should do New York and L.A. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't think I want to do either anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? You don't want to do either? You're gonna close Dash, Calabasas? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I think so. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, that's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If I'm the only one who's willing to sacrifice my time, is it even worth it for me to go by myself to New York and put all this work involved in the store when no one else seems to care? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're, like, basically bailing on everybody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How would I be bailing on everybody? Everybody's bailing on me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What you're saying to her right now is like a bombshell. That's a little dramatic, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruce, come on down! Whoo! Hello, hello! The Brucinator! Hand hug! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hand hug! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's a whole new man. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KRIS: We should all go to New York for the Fourth of July. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited, Miles is here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love New York! &gt;&gt; KIM: The news broke everywhere that I'm dating Miles, and Reggie called me. &gt;&gt; REGGIE:driving me crazy. 513 00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,200 &gt;&gt; KIM: If we're together, you don't text otherwhores.
