- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Previously on Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott-- I honestly really like. I kind of have to like him, 'cause he's the only guy in the family. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Please, back off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't youtalk to me like that. &gt;&gt; WAITER: I can't get you a drink... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Shut your mouth. &gt;&gt; ROB: Just his behavior-- it's just unacceptable. I do not want to be that guy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have this... I have a habit now. Like, my mouth gets really sore when I go... 'Cause I do it constantly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait, come here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, can we get a puppy? If we can have a puppy, say nothing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think we all notice that Bruce can't hear very well lately. Hey, honey. Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How many people do you think are here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I'm getting in response is, "What? Huh?" He doesn't hear anything that I'm saying. We've been out there talking to you for five minutes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you haven't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, we have. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, I'm thinking maybe you might want to go get your ears checked. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My hearing's fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, you need to get your hearing checked, I'm telling you. Don't you think that it's worth going to get it checked out before you lose your hearing all together? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm fine. Please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What if you couldn't 40 00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:39,833 hear my voice ever again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Perfect. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Rob! Rob! &gt;&gt; ROB: So it's my 24th birthday. We're at the Mirage celebrating. Kim's here, Khloe's here. I've got all my close friends here. We're going to have a nice family dinner and then we're going to go party it up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What I don't get about this family is, like, the pressure. I've only been married a year and a half, and the pressure I have to have a baby is so insane. You only have three days out of the month to have a child. It's not that easy. &gt;&gt; KIM: But seriously, Rob, Kourtney... Her feelings are, like, kind of hurt that you didn't, like, invite her. &gt;&gt; ROB: She has a baby. Why would I want her to come to Vegas? Kourtney, like, doesn't come to anything I do, so... I just texted her. I said, "I would love to see Mason, and I miss you. I wish you were here." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, when was the last time you saw Mason? &gt;&gt; ROB: Not for a while. &gt;&gt; KIM: Doesn't that, like, hurt your soul? &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim asked why I don't see Kourtney and Mason often. And the real reason is because of Scott. Scott and I used to hang out. We used to be cool and party. But I live with Khloe and Lamar and from day one Lamar has treated Khloe like a queen. And I don't see that from Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's tacky, it's cheap and it doesn't look good for anybody. &gt;&gt; ROB: The whole Miami incident, him punching the mirror, it just kind of showed his true colors. And, you know, I haven't really spoken to him since that whole incident. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just be, like, considerate that you have other sisters. &gt;&gt; ROB: I really think that you should just stop talking to me about this. You're really getting under my skin right now. I'm not trying to get Kourtney 77 00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,469 involved and I'm kind of keeping her out of the situation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Anybody home? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're up here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khlo-mo. No, no and no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fancy seeing you here, pal. Can you hear me, Grandpa? I came here because I know about your little hearing dilemma. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. My hearing is fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, look what I got you. This is called a Harmony Cone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A Harmony Cone? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can use a little harmony around here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you hear me? Harmony Cone. This will take all the wax buildup out of your ear. Can you hear me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If all you guys shut up over this thing, I'll do one ear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One ear so you can half hear us? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just to get you to... just to get you guys to stop and move on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is what I want you to do. Put this end in your ear to where it's fitting snug... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tell me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You stick it in my ear. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. You have to hold it there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. Promise me, one hour of silence after this is over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just be patient. You can take a nap if needed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God, I'm not taking a nap with a candle in my ear lit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We've got to document this process. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, 'cause you're going to take a picture of this, and then, you know, you're going to, like, put it on YouTube or something. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Don't move. The fire is going to get on the chair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's burning? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One, two... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stupid. This is stupid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that my hair burning? I swear it is. Good. Okay, I'm done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, now look in the ear thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What the hell is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, look... Ew! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw, there's earwax. Khloe, you've got to do the other ear. 'Cause look how much came out of this one. You've got to... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would be happy to, but Bruce won't let me. I think that's not normal. I think we really need to, like, get him to a doctor immediately. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The deal was, an hour of no talking to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, look. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I'm not touching it! Mom, you're going to get... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Earwax, earwax! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! Oh, my God! 126 00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,292 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Earwax. Earwax. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have tea. You could say thank you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Feel better. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're rude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm rude? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm rude 'cause I brought you tea? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but you act like I'm notsick or something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I could show you rude. And I could beat theout of you right now. Tell me how pretty I am. Robert! &gt;&gt; ROB: You're really pretty, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You ungrateful little &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is this for? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You put it in a turkey, I think. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so that should not go in this drawer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know what it's for. Just throw it away. When in doubt, throw away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, where's Rob? I haven't seen Rob in forever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Apparently he's upstairs dying. I think he's hungover, 'cause when I came home and it was midnight... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's always hungover. All everyone says is all he does is go out and, like, party his life away. I think one thing that's really annoying about Rob is that, you know, we are so family-oriented and Rob just lives at Khloe and Lamar's house and he kind of just hangs out there all the time. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, come downstairs right now. Kourtney needs to talk to you. &gt;&gt; ROB: I can't. I didn't get an hour of sleep last night. I'm not feeling good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Was he out partying? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But where were you? 'Cause when we came home at midnight... &gt;&gt; ROB: I've been here all night, Khloe! I had a basketball game and then I came home, and I'm not feeling good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this your penis problem that you've been having? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So that's cured? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Rob. Are you hungover? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't drink. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Weren't you just in Vegas? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but I wasn't drunk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so Friday and Saturday you were drinking, but now it's Tuesday, so you don't drink any... &gt;&gt; ROB: I worked out yesterday. I was supposed to work out today. It has nothing to do with alcohol. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs. So please get out if you're just going to say &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't do any of those things now after Saturday? &gt;&gt; ROB: I had a drink on my birthday. I think that's kind of standard. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A drink? One? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I wasn't belligerent like you and your friends. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You had one drink? &gt;&gt; ROB: So, yo, I need to... I'm trying to get rest, Kourtney. Bible. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really haven't spent quality time with Rob in at least, like, six months. 184 00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,694 And Mason's growing up so quickly and he's missing it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey! Bruce? Bruce?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stressed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How was your...? What, were you at a meeting? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Actually, we had a great meeting with Sears about the Kardashian Kollection. Where are the girls? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: At school, where they're supposed to be. I gotta go pick 'em up in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, I actually told you that you had to pick them up at 1:30. That was, like, 45 minutes ago. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's one thing not to hear me when it just isn't that important and you forget to pick up the milk at the grocery store, but to forget to pick up your kids and not hear that? That concerns me. I just don't get why you didn't pick up the girls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Because I thought... I heard you say, "Pick up the girls" but I thought it wasn't Friday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't need an assistant to go... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you give me so many damn lists it's just just ridiculous. I'm going to get the girls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you pick up the dog? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The dog? What's with the dog? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The dog was getting its teeth extracted. You know, it used to be kind of a joke, "Bruce couldn't hear, Bruce couldn't hear," but Bruce really can't hear. This is only getting more and more serious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll do the kids first, dog second. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Help me! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A calmer, more soothing tone of voice might "Bruce! Bruce!" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you insane? 219 00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:16,856 I know he's scared. I just want Rob to be okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One thing I never do, I never miss carpool. 223 00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:31,104 There they are. Okay... get it over with. Come on. I'm never late. You're just not gonna talk to me, huh? Oh, you're gonna be that ticked off that you're not even gonna talk to me? You're gonna give me the silent treatment? That's even worse. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We've literally been sitting here for, like, an hour waiting. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Seriously, Dad, we've been waiting forever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hmm? Well, I'm sorry. I'm never late. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, we could have been kidnapped. Like, that's just not cool. 236 00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,107 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He probably just didn't even hear. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How did you even know where I live? &gt;&gt; ROB: This is the first time that I've ever been to her house. In my mind, that's terrible, considering she's been here for four to five months. &gt;&gt; ROB: Where's Masey? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He is asleep. &gt;&gt; ROB: I feel bad. I haven't seen Mason. He barely knows who I am. I'm supposed to be his uncle, but I'm trying and I need to make up for lost time. Oh, my stomach. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, you're still feeling sick? &gt;&gt; ROB: My stomach is killing me. It's, like, my pelvis. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe you should lay off the alcohol. &gt;&gt; ROB: Honestly, I really don't appreciate you being, like, busting my balls and acting like I'm a frickin' alcoholic. I came here to hang out with you, see your house, see Mason. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's sleeping. He doesn't revolve around your schedule. You don't even call me to tell me you're coming over. You sleep in all day. You go get a shave, you go get your hair cut, you go to the gym, and then you have Khloe wipe your ass and Lamar feed you. &gt;&gt; ROB: You honestly want to know the reason why I don't come over here? It's 'cause ofScott. He's an alcoholic. Like, he's a negative person in my life. Like, you have a kid. Act like you have a kid. Show me that you're mature enough to have a kid with my sister. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't need these negative thoughts being said about Mason's dad around him, so don't ever think that you're gonna come around and make these kind of comments in front of Mason. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm over this. I don't need you coming over to my house to criticize me and my family, so you can go. I just don't need you in here. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's cool. I came here to see Mason, and you're gonna kick me out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, yes, I am. &gt;&gt; ROB: And I'm gonna leave, and you're gonna feel like an .... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. No, I'm not. Why don't you go drink some more, be hungover, you can feel sick so you can lay in bed for the rest of your life. ♫ ♫ Hola. How are you doing? Sign in. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: She'll be bringing you in in just a minute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. Can't get away from these people. &gt;&gt; SUGARMAN: Tell me what the story is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's what the story is: Kris thinks I'm losing my hearing. Um... I don't think my hearing is as good as it was. I'm 61 years old. &gt;&gt; SUGARMAN: We'll, we're gonna check you out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think my hearing is too bad, but you never know until you get tested. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay, every time you hear a beep, you're gonna press the button. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, I'm focusing so hard on this hearing test, you know? I don't want to get a bad result. You know, I don't want to have to wear a hearing aid. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You're all done. That's it. Not too bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was trying to concentrate so hard. &gt;&gt; SUGARMAN: Well, the suspense is mounting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The suspense is mounting. &gt;&gt; SUGARMAN: You know, there's nothing sinister going on. This is normal for age. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am so relieved to get this result. My hearing seems to be just fine, everybody. &gt;&gt; SUGARMAN: I don't know what goes on in your house, but my wife's favorite thing is it'll be the bottom of the ninth and the last guy's at bat. I'm watching, and she'll come to the door and she'll go, "Ba-da-da da-duh," and I'll go, "Huh?" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, right, yeah. &gt;&gt; SUGARMAN: And she'll go, "You don't pay attention." And she'll storm out of the room. I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honestly, Dr. Sugarman, I think maybe he has the same problem with his wife that I have. &gt;&gt; SUGARMAN: You know, if she says, "Darling, would you like a massage," I bet you hear it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, yeah, well, that's true, yeah. It may be more of that selective hearing that I'm suffering from. Maybe if I could get that in writing, just so I can show it to Kris. "His hearing is fine." &gt;&gt; SUGARMAN: Hearing normal for age. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love it. Doc... &gt;&gt; SUGARMAN: Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I appreciate your help here. We'll keep it going. &gt;&gt; SUGARMAN: Take care, buddy. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey, I'm in the office. How was the doctor? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, he's kinda got the same situation I have, you know, with his wife. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He can't hear? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Well, it's more like selective hearing. You know, where you kinda hear the things you want to hear and don't hear the things you don't want to hear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Selective hearing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, he's got the same problem with his wife. A different tone of voice might work better. No? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A different tone of voice? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, a calmer more soothing tone of voice instead "Bruce! Bruce!" &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're telling me that you're just tuning me out? You're tuning me out? Are you... are you insane? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: First of all, it's insulting to me. It's not nice for you to say that you can hear and it's just my tone of voice and that's why. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I must avoid the stress and it's kind of stressful in here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The fact is, you can't hear! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. I'm going to the golf course. &gt;&gt; KRIS:the golf 345 00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,904 course. Damn it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've sang on stage... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, "YMCA..." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...in front of 7,000 people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You cling on to those '70s, man, like anyone I've ever met. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, this was the '80s. Li'l Abner. Would you like to hear "If I Had My Druthers"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who theis Little Abner and what is a "druther"? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a very famous play. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In what century? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it's Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is anyone here? Rob has to go to the hospital. Rob text me and says that he needs to go to the hospital. I mean, it's so scary. He's in so much pain. I know it's serious. Like, his stomach has been killing him and he can't even get out of bed, and he said he's had to go to the bathroom for a long time and he can't. It, like, hurts right here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, let me go get my tennis shoes on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, hold on, hold on, let's call him. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I thought he was faking. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. It hasn't gotten any better? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know. I literally haven't left my room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's nothing worse than knowing that your child's in pain and you don't know what it is. So I'm going to go straight to Rob's and take him to the emergency ward. You don't sound very good at all. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You guys, hurry up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to go get my 375 00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,075 tennis shoes on, and I'm going to go get Robert. Hey, Rob. You okay? Rob looks pale and very, very quiet, which is unusual for him. And he looks like he's in a lot of pain. &gt;&gt; ROB: I thought it was like, um, it was like indigestion or something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; ROB: But I can't even... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Breathe. It doesn't sound like you can breathe very well. &gt;&gt; ROB: Something is definitely wrong. I'm dying. I'm trying to throw up, I'm trying to go to the bathroom, I'm sweating profusely. I can't do any of those things. I just want to get to the hospital. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, Robert, come go on in. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Jenny, 3999 for a report on room 28. Jenny, 3999. &gt;&gt; ROB: Immediately they start running tests on me. I literally can't keep my mind off of just the pain. It's excruciating. I just want to figure out what's wrong. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: The CAT scan basically shows that the appendix is inflamed. And, uh, very consistent with appendicitis. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay? So in this situation, it's early appendicitis. That means it's not ruptured. The surgery takes about an hour to perform. You're going to be in the hospital tonight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So when you say tonight, like now? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Like, yeah, we're going to go upstairs pretty soon. &gt;&gt; ROB: I've never had emergency surgery before, so going under is scaring me. They got to cut open your, like, stomach-pelvis area. So that's kind of frightening. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know he's scared. 408 00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,404 I'm certainly scared. I just want Rob to be okay. 411 00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,588 &gt;&gt; 414 00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:19,231 So I am so happy and relieved that Rob's out of surgery. And that it's over. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I will see you back at the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Okay, baby, I'm going to go. Are you going to be okay? &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did great, Rob. Love you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, babe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm working on my flight simulator, working on piro flips. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I have your attention for one second? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have my attention. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It really hurt my feelings when you told me that basically, you know, you have selective hearing. And that you kind of choose when to listen to me. Am I really that bad? Am I that much of a nag? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Great. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That makes me feel good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, things have changed so drastically over the years, you know, with us. And there's so much going on in our family. You know, it's-it's difficult. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause I have a lot on my plate... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and I'm juggling a lot of different people. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So sometimes... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I'm in charge of a lot of different things. But of all people, I would expect for you to know how much pressure I'm under, how stressed out I can get, and sort of listen to me in shorthand. But you're not listening to me at all. And that is what... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I listen to you, yeah, but sometimes... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...is hurting my feelings. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...it's not so much the substance that you have to say, it's the style in which you say it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think being married is challenging for sure. And I think marriage is definitely about listening to each other, communicate, communicate, communicate. And then you can also communicate. Okay, so why don't we do this. Why don't we figure out a way that when I have something that I need to say that's really, really important, we'll have, like, a signal. A snap, crackle, pop. So when I want to talk to you, it's like, "Bruce." And you'll know, "Oh, she has something important to say." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What if I have something to say? Do I do the...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The same thing. This is our secret code. So if you walk around all day like that, I'll have to kill you. So listen up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And don't waste that. Don't just, like, do it all the time. Like every time you're talking, be... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, All right. Wait, wait. 465 00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,426 See you in the bedroom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, hey. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look what I brought. How are you feeling? &gt;&gt; ROB: That's nice of you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, isn't it? It's heavier than I am. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's pretty unexpected of you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sorry for not believing you, that you were sick. You obviously were. I just want to, like, get everything back to normal with you and I, and not have, like, this annoying relationship. &gt;&gt; ROB: I really do want to see Mason more. I need to, like, watch him grow up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't want, like, whatever your and Scott's issues are, like, you guys can work that out. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's so much that I've learned from this experience. My family is all about family. You know, blood is thicker than water. I'm still not a fan of Scott, but I am not going to let that get in the way with Kourtney and Mason.
