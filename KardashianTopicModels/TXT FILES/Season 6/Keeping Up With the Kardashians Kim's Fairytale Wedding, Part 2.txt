- Kim's Fairy Tale Wedding: &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We're getting married this summer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I know when you're talking bad about me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is very opportunistic of you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: How dare you question someone else's marriage. I overheard Khloe talking , and I confronted her. &gt;&gt; KIM: When? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: At the engagement dinner. &gt;&gt; KIM: If all of you are talking, there's no reason why any of you should be at my wedding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I didn't... So what, you don't want me at 14 00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,741 your wedding? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I don't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Welcome. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? Kourtney and I are at Vera Wang for our second wedding dress fitting. I'm kind of sad Khloe's not here, but I really haven't spoken to Khloe since our fight. So I'm just going to move on and get through my day. &gt;&gt; VERA: Come on in. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; VERA: I can't believe it. Look at how gorgeous you look. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; VERA: So happy. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's so many dresses, it's like... &gt;&gt; VERA: We're going to have such fun. I can't wait. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, becoming so real. &gt;&gt; VERA: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, weird. &gt;&gt; VERA: I love this for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; VERA: This is hand done. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'd die for that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is having a custom dress made by Vera. So she's just trying on styles and looking at fabrics to just get an idea of what she wants her perfect dress to look like. &gt;&gt; VERA: I think the shape is... it goes without saying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; VERA: I so want to hear about Kris. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's too opinionated. &gt;&gt; VERA: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He'll ask you a million questions. He calls my mom Granny. And he, uh, he's, like, sarcastic. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's the guy that says all the wrong things first. And that's what got me to love him. He says "Everyone hates me at first, and then they love me." So I get that. I really do get that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. 46 00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,931 So everyone's in the hating him phase. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Baby, I'm such a neat person. You gotta, like, do something with this bag. &gt;&gt; KIM: The take-over has started. I'm in Minnesota. I'm here to spend some quality time with Kris. Does it bug you if my shoes are right here then? I'll neatly put them all like this. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah, put them neat. We really need to have a... a talk about the dog memorabilia. Every photo in this house-- lookit... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Those photos were professionally done. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you have those in every single room of-of all of your homes. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: 'Cause that's who I am; I like dogs. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is this? Like, Beanie Babies? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: My grandpa got that for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: And like family photos by your bed. Seriously, do you want to, like, have sex and look at your parents? You have to admit you're like... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: My house is great. Let's go to the grocery store though. I want to, uh, get some stuff to grill. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, but do you think that those butterfly paintings and this fake flower and these hideous sconces... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Those are nice. &gt;&gt; KIM: This looks like the-the Price is Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, through this door you can get this heinous bedroom 75 00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,977 set that all matches. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Office. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Office. Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You sound happy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just a little frustrated and a little disappointed in myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At the engagement shower, Brittny and I were talking. And, um, Kris Humphries came in and kind of overheard us talking. And I was just basically telling him, you know, I just want to make sure he treats my sister right. And he's in it for the right reasons and not for anything else. And now Kim went off on me and dis-invited me to the wedding. Not... &gt;&gt; KRIS: She dis-invited you to the wedding? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I just feel like Iup by being so honest. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think you can ever be too honest, Khloe. You can always be honest with me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I was walking by and I thought I heard little Khloe's voice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: As long as you don't tell me I'm too fat. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, baby. How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm more upset about... I... The bachelorette party is so soon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're throwing the party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not going. And I would just love if someone would go to a sex store and get some of, like, that... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. No, no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...funky ... It's like... Bruce, it's tradition. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's make a list at what you need at this store. I will go and get this stuff, but I'll tell you something. I think you're going to be doing more damage than good. And I think you should reconsider. Although Khloe doesn't want to come to the bachelorette party, years from now she'll be so sorry that she missed such a special event in Kim's life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you need to buy at a... at a sex store? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. He'd be scared to go into a sex store. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not me. I've never been there, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS AND KHLOE: You've never been to a sex store? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They have, like, blow-up male dolls that you could have sex with, strap-ons and like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Strap-ons. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have like condoms everywhere and lube and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Condoms. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you have to get anal ring toss. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that a rash? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that an STD? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. 123 00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,594 You could try it, and you'll get the STD. &gt;&gt; KIM: Even the grocery carts in Minnesota are weird. Minnesota Bride? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: "50 Sex Moves"? I've only seen about three. That's false advertising. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, look. It says "Kim and Khloe, it's war." "Khloe believes Kim is determined to outdo her and Lamar's wedding." &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: So you think that's true? &gt;&gt; KIM: "Kim put her fiance under pressure to up the ante. Kris had a hard time coming up with two million dollars for Kim's 20.5-carat ring." &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm hoping Khloe just mans up and apologizes. I don't think she has a right to really judge everyone that comes in and out and kind of put her stamp of approval. I think it all honestly started when she said, "Is this for real with the ring?" And I was, like, "No. It's a joke." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim is engaged. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this real or a joke? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's a joke. It's a joke. I was joking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're joking about what? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, like, why wouldn't it be real? Are you the only one that can get married? It's just almost, like, "Oh, you're going to take the shine away from me and my, like, basketball player husband?" It would be really sad if Khloe and I didn't work it out before the wedding. I just hope that it doesn't get to that point where we don't get that opportunity. I just feel bad that she... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I want us all to be able to, like, just hang out, you know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I said, "Oh, why don't you guys come to Minnesota?" She's, like, "I will never come to Minnesota." &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: She said that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: And it's just, like, it's unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whew. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't believe I'm here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your maiden voyage. If I'm going to get stuck with theparty, then I'm taking Bruce along with me. Because I am not going in that store by myself. What is that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a hat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're wearing a baseball cap? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe I won't get recognized. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look stupid, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stay away from me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Take the baseball cap off. Like, they're not going to know. Who do they think I'm with, 007? Hello. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What were we supposed to get? stuff? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is your department, not mine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe said it was a party. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wedding Bell Bingo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's as sexy as you can get? Then I'm in trouble if that's what you think you should be buying in the Pleasure Chest. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your girls get in a fight, and we wind up in a sex store. It just doesn't seem fair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just feel bad that Khloe's not going to come to the party. She's really upset. They're like in this huge feud. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The is such a special moment, you know, in Kim's life that my wife wants it to be perfect. But this drama happens in our family all the time. So, you know, we'll get through it. Here we go. Now we're talking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you think? It looks very couture. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just follow me. Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't get crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, look. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm going to pull you around to the bedroom, honey. Okay, kitty. Come with me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, you're... you're choking me. It's not sexy anymore. I think we have everything. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: $150.54. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sex ain't cheap, is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, thank you. 196 00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,720 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, that was exciting. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've got a surprise. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You got a bucket? &gt;&gt; KIM: Voila. I have went to the store. And I have the perfect pedicure kit for you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I have the best... &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: ...feet in the NBA. &gt;&gt; KIM: And your feet gross me out. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I've got the best feet in the NBA. &gt;&gt; KIM: My brother gets a mani-pedi once a week. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: And people question your brother's manhood. Can I get the remote and some stuff? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, we're going to talk. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's kind of... Is it weird that we're both doing a bachelor party in Vegas the same weekend... bachelor and bachelorette? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, we're not going to see each other at all. We'll be at different hotels. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Because Khloe's not coming, like, should I not invite Lamar? I mean, I think it's so lame that Khloe won't go. We're heading to Vegas this weekend for my bachelorette party, and Khloe and I still haven't spoken. I don't really have the time to, like, sit and really work it out with Khloe. We either just need to, like, let it go and revisit it later or just not be arguing at a time like this. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: But I do want to have a good time with all the guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, and you will. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's like the last moment that I can be with my guys and not be, you know... &gt;&gt; KIM: And not be what? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Held accountable for my actions. &gt;&gt; KIM: Dream on. Did you just fart? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No. I think the chair moved. &gt;&gt; KIM: You just farted. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, I didn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, you... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, I didn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, right in my face. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, I didn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is torture. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Finish. &gt;&gt; KIM: Doing your fungus feet, and you're farting in my face. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I didn't fart. &gt;&gt; MAN: Action. Action. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today Lamar and I have a photo shoot. &gt;&gt; MAN: Rolling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We love working together. We have so much fun being around each other. Perfect. We killed it. Good job. Two championships, baby. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I can't be that cool. &gt;&gt; MAN: Excellent. You're on fire. Phenomenal. Work this. Love that right there. Oh, I love that face! Love that! Make America fall in love. All right, relax for a second. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The last thing, and we're done. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's all goody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm a little... not concerned-- a little... like, I find it really odd, and maybe it's 'cause Kim is so busy with wedding stuff, but I'm a little shocked that our, like, argument has gone on this long, and we haven't spoken. You know, I'm kind of unsure if I could be the first one to step up. 'Cause I don't want to force myself onto Kim at her bachelorette party. She told me she doesn't want me at the wedding. So I just don't want to ruin her bachelorette party by showing up, and she's, like, "I hate you." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't think you can ruin it by showing up. Family, at the end of the day, is all you got. And this is something that, um, you know, if she doesn't do, she'll definitely regret for the rest of her life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Typically, our fights last, like, a day, even if, like, no matter how many bad words we say to one another and how many names we call, would still... pretty quick, 'cause we're sisters. Maybe she's just too preoccupied, but, I mean, she told me she doesn't want me at the wedding. So why the hell would she want me at the bachelorette party? 267 00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,846 &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't really think she feels like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I'm going to change my last name to Humphries. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are incorporated. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are so selfish. Oh, my God. Tres fab. Sharon honestly created my dream wedding. 274 00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:12,565 It is just like pure heaven. &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome to the Boys &amp; Girls Club. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Hi &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim's here with me at my event today, and I'm thrilled that she really gets to see what I do with my foundation. Look at this lady. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; DON: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; DON: Good to have you with him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; DONNA: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, we were cooking at Kris' house, and I saw that recipe book. And my favorite recipe was the family recipe. You need two parents, one and a half kids, sensitivity, lots of love. It was in there. 290 00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,344 It was so cute. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm Kris. I've played in the NBA for-- this'll be my eighth year. How I got to where I'm at has just been through focus, dedication, hard work. There's no shortcut to being good at something. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have never really seen Kris in front of, like, a group of kids. Makes me realize that he's going to be a really good dad one day. Kind of like reminds me of Bruce a little bit. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Life is about helping other people and becoming a better person, as well as, you know, achieving things for yourself. Thank you guys. Spread your fingers a little bit. Can you jump and get it? Having Kim in Minnesota is really cool. She's laid back, much more down to earth. The question is can Kim imagine herself living in Minnesota? Thanks for coming today. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's fun to see what you do when I'm not around. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: How cute were my grandma and grandpa? &gt;&gt; KIM: They were so cute. Don and Donna? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. I don't ever want you to do any plastic surgeries. &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe, I love you, but I will tell you I'm going on a girls' vacation and come back looking so fab with huge boobs. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Well, they're already huge. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I'm saying when... after we-- after we have, like, four kids... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Like, rockets? Like, just like... &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: They'll be built for speed not comfort anymore? All right, I gotta go back out there. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can literally eat myand lick my at the same time. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Whoa, whoa. &gt;&gt; KIM: They'll be so down. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're disgusting, and you are in a Boys &amp; Girls Club, and that is totally 325 00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:36,376 inappropriate. All right? &gt;&gt; MAN: Kim, over here, Kim. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, watch it. &gt;&gt; MAN: Back up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am starving. They have breakfast all day here. What's that look for? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All those flashes just messed me up a little bit. But that was crazy outside. The paparazzi, they're hitting people, running into people. &gt;&gt; KIM: This hectic-ness and all the, you know, the people and the crying and the stories and, like, all this stuff is only getting worse. Like, are you prepared to deal with this, you know? This, like, attention definitely stresses Kris out. I think it's getting a little out of hand for him. I'm nervous to see how that's gonna go. Thank you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Maybe you should just move to Minnesota with me. We could move into my little place on the lake. We can just start pumping out babies. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think the reason I fell in love with you is 'cause you could handle my career. &gt;&gt; KIM: And my career wasn't an issue for you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's a little annoying to have that many people following us. All these distractions can lead to issues that shouldn't really be there. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, how was lunch, you 350 00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,302 guys? &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Come on, be nice. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Get off the car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, let's go see if Wolfgang's in the kitchen. &gt;&gt; MAN: Here you are. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Mmm! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, everyone. &gt;&gt; PUCK: You know... hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are meeting with Wolfgang Puck to do a food tasting for the wedding. And we've known Wolfgang for a long time. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is this? &gt;&gt; PUCK: This... Santa Barbara shrimp. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Are those alive? &gt;&gt; KIM: &gt;&gt; PUCK: This is less dangerous than the basketball. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Is that cornbread, my man? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. He'll bring it out. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What-what is that right there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you can't just come in the kitchen and take what you want. &gt;&gt; PUCK: ...everything about you now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is Wolfgang Puck. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Definitely one of the things I love about Kris, that he always acts like a big kid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kris, that's his serving spoon. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's a spoon for him. But on the other hand, it's like the thing that annoys me about him. I love strawberries and that cheese and nuts. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What about this straight Caesar salad action? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No bueno? &gt;&gt; MAN: So, re-done. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a re-plated one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're in the gorgeous... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This cheese is really good. &gt;&gt; MAN: Fresh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, so good. &gt;&gt; PUCK: Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, we're better than all right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; PUCK: Did you eat? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm obsessed. I'm so full. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We gotta get a time where we can sit down and give her some cooking lessons. &gt;&gt; PUCK: You know what I tell every young bride... is she should spend more time in the bedroom than in the kitchen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what he told me, and I had six kids. &gt;&gt; PUCK: I know. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wow. I love it. Hi, baby. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. Just packing. I'm packing for Vegas for my bachelorette party this weekend. I love this outfit. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: With the Hermes belt. &gt;&gt; KIM: With the "H" for my new last name. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: For Humphries? So now you have to buy me all new Hermes stuff. So I can have "H"s everywhere. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We never really had the talk. You're changing your name to Humphries? &gt;&gt; KIM: Probably. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I feel like you're just saying that. You wouldn't actually do that. Khloe would do that for Lamar. She's that down for him. Are you actually going to do it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Kris is a really traditional guy. And I know it would mean the world to him if I changed my last name to Humphries. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That just shows you how down you are for your man and how traditional you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm a down &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Come here. Ah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sweaty. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Your butt is a little sweaty right on the... 410 00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,682 &gt;&gt; KIM: I've been packing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Packing what? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris and I are having our joint bachelor/bachelorette party in Vegas this weekend. But everything is going to be so separate. The girls are staying at the Palazzo. The boys are at the Venetian. Girls are doing Tao. 417 00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:55,167 Boys are doing Lavo. So, totally different vibe. &gt;&gt; ROB: We're on our way to Vegas. And, of course, we are flying commercial. Ooh. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I want to let you guys know I really appreciate you coming. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Well, thanks. We really appreciate you flying us commercial. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bachelorette people, cheers. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Where's Khloe? &gt;&gt; KIM: She's not here. I think it is so crazy that Khloe's not coming to my bachelorette party. Regardless of any argument, this is something that she should just be at. I honestly, I told you that is, like, the last straw with me. How dare you not come? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And now it's making it a major fight. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. It's like we would have gotten over it. 435 00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,979 You're making it such a big deal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You may have seen mine. It's all Louis Vuitton limited edition. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: How many bags did you bring? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, dude, it's Vegas. For two nights, ten suits. I got white dinner jackets. I got black tuxedoes. I got white tuxedoes. I got matching... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Bro, there's a dress code, though. No suits. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you, a baby? This is the room that Bobby used to rent. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kim's getting married. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, right? I need a nap. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is party time, not glam time. We are in Las Vegas. We're ready to have fun. And I cannot wait to take Kim up to her room so she can see her little surprise I have for her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Holla! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't even have table two. That's your table. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but they added this. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You know, I'm not doing this right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here we go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Holla! We're here! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoo!! &gt;&gt; KIM: Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey! &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe is here, and I am honestly so shocked that she's here 'cause I really expected her to be, like, really hardheaded and, like, not come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't... You and I need to have a talk... &gt;&gt; KIM: The flowers are cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...and I won't try any funny stuff. You look fab. You're the only bachelorette girl I know that looks this pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: I must say... this outfit is pretty sexy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm, like, sweating like a whore in church. &gt;&gt; KIM: It, like, means a lot to me that you did come 'cause I thought... Like, we fight, and then we make up, like, two seconds later. So I felt like if you weren't gonna come to my bachelorette party, that would be so lame. Obviously, Kim, this is your wedding. Me and Kris, especially if he's gonna be my brother-in-law, we're going to get into arguments. Nothing... it's not gonna be... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. But at the beginning is a little weird. It's, like, why is everyone...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it's life. That's how we are. That's family. We're not gonna treat him any differently and special treat him. But I want you to know, like, I would never in my life miss something like this. I would never not come to your bachelorette party. I would never not be a part of your wedding. This is all fun. Like, I wanted to show you... Like, I know you don't like and this and that. But, like, you know those are candy, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have no idea what you're saying. I'm so excited that she came, honestly. It makes me realize that Khloe will always be there for me. I mean, we're sisters. I love you. And thank you so much for coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do one thing for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? Don't say, "Shake your" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, say it. Shake your I did it for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: The festivities will continue later. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get out of here, or I'll shove this up your &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I like stuff like that to happen. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys, Kim loves! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. I just wanted to thank all of you guys for coming out. I love you all. And I cannot wait to celebrate this whole weekend with you guys. 504 00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:57,943 And I love you. &gt;&gt; MAN: 'Cause this... these are all your people now. It's a good group.

I'm not soft 'cause I'm getting married. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: To Kris. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Onefor the rest of your life, bro. &gt;&gt; MAN: You didn't know about that move. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: We're cool. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'll be right there, we'll be doing some... some, uh, couples dates, bro. They're gonna force us into a friendship eventually. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm looking forward to bond a little bit with Kris, get to know him. There's always people around, and we haven't been able to kick it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Jamaica, Queens. Cheers. &gt; MAN: Yo, yo, tell 'em, Las Vegas! You gotta make some 526 00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:07,346 noise, everybody, 'cause the princess is in the building! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so glad you came to my bachelorette. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I'm so glad you wanted me here. &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh, Las Vegas, give it up 'cause Kris Humphries is celebrating his bachelor party tonight! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This is your world. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yours now, too. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Your world. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yours, too. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Paparazzi followed out of the house, and I dip on them real quick. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I, I'm not saying that you want it. I'm saying that it's there for you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You can't avoid it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's inevitable. It's just what it is. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Odom! &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Why am I with you right now? This is a, uh, this is a bachelor party. 546 00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:30,729 I love you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I'm going to bed. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Is this where the party is? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? You look beautiful. Today is Kim's bridal shower. All of our friends and family are coming to celebrate for Kim. And I know she's going to have the best day. &gt;&gt; MEL B: I'm huge. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm excited for your shower. &gt;&gt; MEL B: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you? Yeah. &gt;&gt; MEL B: I've finally succumbed to it. I didn't even see that. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're so ridiculous. We're like... &gt;&gt; MEL B: The bigger, the better. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, let's go outside. Little surprise. &gt;&gt; SERENA: Oh, my God, you look stunning. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so glad you made it. Let's take a picture of the three of us Finally. &gt;&gt; LISA: Uh, uh, we came. &gt;&gt; KIM: I loved my shower. I mean, all my family members came out. I'm officially off the market, so... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I am... think I'm gonna change my last name to Humphries. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: No way. &gt;&gt; SERENA: Really? Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: When I told him, he was so excited. &gt;&gt; SERENA: Aw... &gt;&gt; KIM: He was, like, that now I can't be, like, "What?" I have a stage name. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe Kim is talking about how she's gonna change her name to Humphries. She needs to be Kim Kardashian. There is no way that I'm letting Kim change her name. Hey, Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: This is gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...can I just talk to you for a second? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...in my office? I just overheard you talking to your friends about changing your name to Humphries. &gt;&gt; KIM: Excuse me, Miss Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are incorporated. Kim Kardashian, Inc. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: You are being so ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not. Actually, Kim Kardashian... &gt;&gt; KIM: People get married. My life is going to be with this person. I want it to be Kim and Kris Humphries. What's wrong with that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think...? &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't do this to me at my shower. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously, you are so selfish. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Britney Spears didn't change her name. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you have the miles or not? Do you need me to put... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm having someone check. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, how long does it take? Anytime I ask Kris to do something, it takes him about a week to accomplish it. We don't have that kind of time. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Are you excited to be getting married? &gt;&gt; KIM: Truly, nothing more that I would want to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who do you think is taller, Lamar or Kris? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think Lamar is, isn't he? It's like known. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think it's a good idea for Kim to change her name to Humphries? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think it's a good idea if that's what she wants to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not a good idea. Today, Bruce and I and the rest of the family are going to see Kendall and Kylie at cheer camp. I kind of feel like I need a little bit of backup on the subject of Kim changing her name. So I'm going to try to enlist Khloe and Kourtney to help me knock some sense into Kim. Bring where... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. What? Auntie Kendall and Kylie. Here they come, Mason! Oh! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go, girls! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys looked so great. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you guys for coming. Lammie! Lammie! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just-- I'm not sure about Kim changing her last name to Humphries. And it's really bugging me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, you're the manager. You tell her what to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are no help. Honestly. Mason, you like Grandma, don't you? Yes. No? Mason. Nobody likes me today. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Is Kris coming, too? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You want him to sit next to you over there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, that's fine. I'll get started. This meeting is to do our seating chart. Which they always say is, like, the most heated part of it. And Kris is outside playing with a toy helicopter. Like, come on, we have a week. Work has to be done. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Those dogs are delicious. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You can barely even see where they peed. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Oh, they peed in here? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I thought they peed over there. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, they peed over here. Okay, before we start, let's all bring it in. Dear God, may we have a clear mind, not get in a fight, and make some great decisions. Amen. So seating-- we're sitting here. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're the most prestigious table, number one. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Obviously. &gt;&gt; SHARON: It was the idea, up to you guys. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: But we're not right in front of the stage, though. &gt;&gt; SHARON: We are here, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: I want my friends at this table. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay, do you want to do that next? &gt;&gt; KIM: So, table two, yeah. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wait, your friends get to go to table two? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Why do you get this table? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I really don't want to do anything right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I get really frustrated because I'm dealing with so many other things. He should at least be able to step up and take care of a few things. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: She can have that table. &gt;&gt; SHARON: What a guy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SHARON: You're going to be Mr. and Mrs. soon. 661 00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,509 &gt;&gt; KIM: Lucky us. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm just stressed out, baby. I went through my miles. My miles, like, got screwed up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you have the miles or not? Do you need me to put it under my points? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm having someone check. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, how long does it take? It's been, like, two hours. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: I asked for him to use his miles to pay for the pastor's ticket, 'cause it's his pastor. It's just, anytime I ask Kris to do something, it takes him about a week to accomplish it. We don't have that kind of time. You think that I've been trying to keep you out of the loop, but it's like way easier to not stress you than... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: But then you come in and freak out on me. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I don't get when it's, like-- if I need an answer on something, I don't get why it takes 500 hours. When I asked that morning, I said, "We'll see you and Ann," and I've already gotten an answer back ten minutes after. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Are you excited to be getting married? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh... truly, nothing more that I would want to do. I'm calling people and dis-inviting them. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't want to look back at a wedding and think Kim stressed me out. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're going to have to get a whole new location. This is no joke. &gt;&gt; VERA: Where's Kim? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's trying her dress on. Kim has called a meeting at Vera Wang's salon one last time. Because Kim has decided to wear three dresses, and needs our help to decide when to wear which dress. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ready. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're ready. &gt;&gt; VERA: Look at that... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that is... amazing. &gt;&gt; VERA: Look at the lacework. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that gorgeous? &gt;&gt; VERA: Is that the aisle dress, guys? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait, you want to use all the dresses? &gt;&gt; KIM: So there's two dresses that I can't decide between for the actual wedding part. I need your guys' help. Do I walk down the aisle in this one or the next one? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How could you not walk down the aisle in that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, let's see the other one. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause you're going to die when you see the other one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so amazing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; VERA: It's glued to her body. Is that glued to her body? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like the other one for down the aisle. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it's the other one down the aisle, do the dinner in this one... &gt;&gt; VERA: With the long lace. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then change for the party. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then change for the... for, like, the dancing and the performances. And it's so dramatic to have three dresses. Who does that? I honestly cannot decide which dress to wear. I know for sure I'm going to wear a really comfortable dress for, like, the after party. Okay, so then this will be... I'll wear Spanx, and this is going to come way in. &gt;&gt; VERA: Kris, what do you think? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Gorgeous. &gt;&gt; VERA: That's the party dress. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Old Hollywood glam. Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wanted to show you this. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is a ring bearer's pillow that my grandmother made. &gt;&gt; VERA: No way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And this was what was at my wedding to your dad. You don't have to use it, but I just thought I'd show it to you. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, of course. &gt;&gt; VERA: She brought it today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause I found it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's really pretty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; KIM: I would love to use it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim looks spectacular. Everything is happening so fast. And now I'm anxious, and I think it's giving me real butterflies. You girls better not get married 733 00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,071 too soon. I can't go through this again. &gt;&gt; MAN: Give it a shake. There you go. Nice, if you can do that, you're going to look awesome. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim tells me to come all the way over to this photo shoot. It took me forever, in traffic. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so stressed. I'm calling people and dis-inviting them. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Invites are sent and now you want to dis-invite people? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's the whole problem. We've invited way too many people. We're 150 people over the seating limit. You said 50 people on your list were not going to show up-- that you have to send out the invites just as a courtesy. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I told you 30. &gt;&gt; KIM: You told me 50. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't want to look back at a wedding and think, it was so stressful, Kim stressed me out. I think the focus should be about the ceremony, the love and the union we're forming, and less about everything else. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're going to have to get a whole new location. This is no joke, Bible. Like, I'm... It's embarrassing, but I have to do it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Listen, you're an extremist. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not funny. Kris just does not stop cracking jokes, and at some point we have to take this seriously. Like, this is our wedding. We do not have a lot of 759 00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:18,576 time here. Not funny. My sisters and I were talking about keeping Kardashian as my last name. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I just think you let your family make decisions 764 00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,822 for you. You're 30 years old. Grow up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. What is so important you couldn't tell me over the phone? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I have been working on a fabulous decision to change your name to Humphries. I've had to work out a whole new line of stuff that goes with your new name. And I think we'll just call you and your husband "Hump." Get it? Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I get it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then here I thought well, we could do the Hump Rope instead of the jump rope. And it could help you build, like, your booty. Do you like it? Hump Rope? It kinda goes with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've never met a more embarrassing person. And this is Hump Plants. And then my favorite, your new fragrance, Hump. &gt;&gt; KIM: Spray hump after you take a dump? Of course I'm not gonna tell my mom that I get her point just because I have too much pride for that. But I do see her point and I do get it. And you know, maybe she's right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want you to take this with you and show it to your hubby with an H, and then think about what you've given me to work with. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think you are humiliating with an H. I need to get a Hump Rope and hang you from it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What the duck? Why is there sticky on my counter? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause you have a baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not from him. It's probably from Scott. Well, hello there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. I see you're wearing the Humphries belt with the camel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: It has a hump. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sorry, Hermes does not mean Humphries. &gt;&gt; KIM: In my world it does. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure they would be very proud of that. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's why I registered for all of the Hermes dishes because it just has an H in the middle of the plate. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you gonna do with all your stuff with K's on it? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't have dishes with K's on it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you change your last name to Humphries, what is gonna happen to Kim Kardashian perfume? Are you gonna stop making it and start making Kim Humphries perfume? &gt;&gt; KIM: So Mom came up with this whole idea to change my branding from Kardashian to Humphries. So she made our logo, it's just gonna be Hump with a big butt like that's the Hump. She came up with the Hump Rope. My new fragrance was just gonna be called Hump. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Smell like a big, fine piece of &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, are you gonna name your kids, like, whatever Kardashian Odom? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Their last name's Odom, my last name's Odom. My middle name is Kardashian. My name's not hyphenated. And so are you not changing your last name or you are? I'm confused. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've decided I'm not. I mean, the more I think about it, there's so much with like, K-Dash, and... I feel like I have to tell Kris that I'm not gonna change my last name to Humphries, but we've been, like, so on each other's nerves right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think you and Kris need to have, like, a for real conversation about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris is really traditional, so I think it will hurt his feelings if I'm not gonna change my last name. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honesty is the best policy. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I gotta go. I will definitely tell him sooner than later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Toodeloo. &gt;&gt; KIM: I hate these... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This stickiness has now seeped through the paper towel. 833 00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:48,620 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would buy a Hump Rope. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm sweating. I'm at home and I'm sweating. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. I am so nervous to tell Kris that I'm not gonna change my last name. I really have no idea what he's gonna say or how he's gonna react. Um, my sisters and I were talking. And we were just saying that, um... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You were saying what? &gt;&gt; KIM: We were just, like, the importance of keeping Kardashian as my last name. After really, like, thinking about it and talking about it, I really think that that's, like, the best thing to do. We, like, got into a fight about, like, everything you could possibly think of. I'm just, like, freaked out that maybe this isn't what he wants anymore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be. &gt;&gt; KIM: You look amazing. &gt;&gt; MAN: Like a star, babe. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You look so good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seeing Rob in his tux reminds me of my dad, and all these memories are coming up. 853 00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:56,087 : I wish my dad was here. &gt;&gt; KIM: After thinking about it and talking about it, keeping Kardashian as my last name, I really think that that's, like, the best thing to do. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This is not your family's decision. This is your decision. &gt;&gt; KIM: But this is what I want to do. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Whether Kim takes my last name or not should not be up for debate for the family. It should be between me and Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: People know me as Kim Kardashian. I don't think it's gonna resonate, if all of a sudden it's Kim Humphries. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I just think you let your family make decisions for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: How am I letting my family, like...? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Because you have to go huddle with them every time, like, there's an issue. You're 30 years old. Grow up. Grow up. &gt;&gt; KIM: How am I letting...? Grow up? I think Kris is just really upset, but my last name has become my business. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We're partners, and, like, you gotta understand that, like, I have to be your best friend. I have to be the one you talk to. You can't just run off to your sisters, especially decisions that we should be making together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sisters listen to each other, we talk to each other. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We're partners. Like, we're best friends. We're partners. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your best friends are your dogs, okay? &gt; HUMPHRIES: That's not true. No. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm planning a wedding. The last thing I need to do is stress over your not agreeing with all my decision. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I feel like I'm just a roadblock on your highway to Kim's perfect wedding. I just wish that you'd be a little bit more down to earth about the wedding process. &gt;&gt; KIM: I live in a different world. I was definitely raised in a different world than, like, Yee-ha Minnesota, and that's fine. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim, four years ago you sold clothes in a boutique in the Valley. And now, like, all of a sudden, you're Miss Princess. &gt;&gt; KIM: You knew what you were getting into. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: With what? &gt;&gt; KIM: With my work ethic, with everything I do. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: "My work ethic." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, like, keeping my Kardashian name is a business decision. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't have a problem with that. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you don't understand that, then that's a problem for me. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Okay, well, then maybe we have a problem. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have to go get ready, and I just cannot even deal with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim? That's cute. Are you gonna wear that on your honeymoon? &gt;&gt; KIM: If we ever have one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. So what happened? &gt;&gt; KIM: We, like, got into a fight about, like, everything you can possibly think of. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, what's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: To be honest, I don't even know who's mad at who or what we're mad at or anything. I think I'm mad at his existence. Like, we're mad at everything with each other. We're just annoyed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think Kim and Kris just need to try to relax for a minute and focus on why they're getting married in the first place. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know how Elizabeth Taylor got married so many times. Like, I couldn't take this anymore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's why I said I will never ever have a wedding. &gt;&gt; KIM: Word to the wise? Elope. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just wish all these other little problems weren't messing with our relationship, and I'm just, like, freaked out that maybe this isn't what he wants anymore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everybody's, like, a half an hour late. There's a dinner in an hour. Nobody's taking this seriously. Tonight is the rehearsal dinner at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Congratulations! &gt;&gt; GIRL: You're so pretty! &gt;&gt; KIM: I have so much going on with this wedding, and all of this arguing, it's really, like, put a damper on the excitement and the fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! Oh, the guys finally showed up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why did you grow a mustache? Is that what grooms do? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm just expressing myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: are you gonna shave it before the wedding? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm gonna shave my head bald and have a mustache with earrings to send a message. &gt;&gt; KRIS: To what? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'll send a message to Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Come here, bridesmaids. I have gifts for all of you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim designed these with the help of Judith Leiber. &gt;&gt; KIM: And me, I got myself one. These are my bridesmaids gifts. &gt;&gt; WILLIAM: Is there a similar unveiling for the men? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. That's up to your son. &gt;&gt; KIM: Judith Leiber made these beautiful clutches for all my bridesmaids. I really wanted to give everyone something that they will remember the wedding by. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, everybody at me first, Albert second. Me, me, me, me. Thank you. &gt;&gt; SHARON: All right, my bride and my groom, can I trouble you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I got my new groom. &gt;&gt; SHARON: You're over here, groom. Okay, Kris and Bruce, you're over here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Will you get off the phone and pay attention? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Still gonna scream at you when I get a chance. &gt;&gt; KIM: Go for it. I'llslice you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: When we get home... &gt;&gt; KIM: Slice. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: There's all sorts of tension between Kim and I. If we're fighting like this the day of the wedding, she will not be able to find me. I might just stay here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, stay with one of your friends. Kris and I are just, like, kinda snapping at each other. The wedding is, like, a few days away. We just have to get through this. &gt;&gt; SHARON: All right, here we go. Go slowly, like, and smile. Slower, slower. And now. And then when you get to the next little thing, I want you to stop. Kris? Kris? When she gets to this second row... Yo, Kris, when she gets to the second row, I need you to come down, come on down now. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Second row? &gt;&gt; SHARON: Come on with me. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Second row. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Thanks, Bruce. You're a great man. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's right. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Hug him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got it. Good luck. Thank you, sir. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Okay, then you're gonna take her by her arm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not like that. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Like this? &gt;&gt; SHARON: Whatever. Nice, loving, like you were yesterday. Okay, good. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to do this! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want to do this. &gt;&gt; KIM: The main question is how fast can you still run? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; KIM: We can go for it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're gone. We're out of here! While you got a chance. This is your last chance. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Mup-mup- mup-mup-mup-mup-mup. &gt;&gt; SHARON: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can keep up with you in that dress and the heels. Yeah, I guarantee it. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Okay, take her to the altar, dude. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right, come on, man. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Let's go. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Let's get this over with so you can be a happy person again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then I go sit down. &gt;&gt; SHARON: No, you're gonna go over here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's definitely interesting to be here so close to the wedding and feel this energy in the room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; SHARON: Fast, fast, let's go! &gt;&gt; KRIS: My daughter's getting married, my daughter's getting married, uh-uh-uh! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna do that seating real quick. We're gonna need Kris, too. He's not supposed... I don't know who that is. He can't be at that table. Can someone get Kris? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Switching the tables? &gt;&gt; KIM: You added Robert Nikufes at my friends' table. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't even have table two, that's your table. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but they added this and your friend. This is not correct. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm not doing this right now. Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: We don't have any other time to do it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't care. I'm not doing this right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let me handle everything, as always. All right, handled that. Was there anyone else I forgot? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so here's what you wrote. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't even have table two. That's your table. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but they added this and your friend. This is not correct. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm just annoyed because the closer the wedding gets, the crazier Kim is getting. The stress of the wedding is starting to affect the rest of my life. You know, I'm not doing this right now. Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: We don't have any other time to do it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't care. I'm not doing it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are such a dude. 1024 00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:40,351 Let me handle everything. As always. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KIM: Even though we're arguing, we still have this huge dinner with all of our friends and family. And I'm hoping we can just forget about the tension and the drama and let's just enjoy ourselves. &gt;&gt; SIMONE: I like your suit. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Where are we sitting at? Thank you. Hand-stitched. You like my mustache, though? &gt;&gt; MARC: I was gonna say that. &gt;&gt; SIMONE: Are you keeping it for the wedding? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Please talk him out of it. &gt;&gt; MARC: You're gonna wake up Saturday morning and shave it. Trust me. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: She'll shave it or I'll shave it? &gt;&gt; MARC: Both together. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hey, this is all I feel like I have left, is my mustache. It's the only way to send a message to Kim. Where are we sitting at? &gt;&gt; KIM: Over there. &gt;&gt; SIMONE: Nice chatting with you. How are you letting this... &gt;&gt; KIM: He hates me. &gt;&gt; SIMONE: It's normal. &gt;&gt; KIM: We hate each other. &gt;&gt; SIMONE: It's fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not normal. &gt;&gt; SIMONE: No, when you walk down... &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you two hate each other? &gt;&gt; MARC: We didn't speak, really, for the last two weeks before our wedding. &gt;&gt; SIMONE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; MARC: It's completely normal. &gt;&gt; SIMONE: It's totally fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Because I hate him. &gt;&gt; SIMONE: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Every last thing annoys me. &gt;&gt; MAN: There he is! What state are we in? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm ready to get out of here. When is this thing over at? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, that's his friends' table. Oh, so he's going to sit with his friends and not me. 1059 00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:54,225 That's fun. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hold on. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Kris... What, are youyour friends off over there? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, they were just talking about how nice you look tonight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. First of all, I just want to thank everybody for being here tonight. If you ask me where... &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't cry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where I would want to be, right now, at this very moment in time, it's right here. I love you guys very much, and, Kris, I know that we've given you a really hard time over the last couple of months. You've really proven yourself to be an amazing guy. 1072 00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:39,370 And, Kim, we're really happy for you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: After months and months of preparation, the wedding is finally here. Khloe and Lamar, you were geniuses to do this in ten days. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nine days. But you know, Kimberly, you've always had a very special part in my heart. It's not going to be easy on Saturday to give you away. Kris, you have no idea what you're getting into, but you're learning. I just want to have the honor of wishing you guys the best of luck. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give it up for Jordan Farmar, who used be a Laker, and now you're a Net. &gt;&gt; JORDAN: Talk for real. Uncensored. Being a Laker, you're kind of used to seeing celebrities and stars at the games all the time. With the Nets it's really, you know, not that often. So when Kim came to the game, sitting courtside with Carla, it was kind of a big deal, so... So I get the text message from Carla, um, "Who's number 43?" They didn't know his name, they didn't know nothing about him. So, we ended up going out as a group. Had a nice dinner, all hung out. Kris and I, we went home, and he was just telling me that he liked her and everything was going good. I get a text message from Carla. "This is Kim's number. Give it to Kris." I was like, "Dude, you didn't even get her number?" You know, that was the start of it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hearing Kris's friend's speech at the rehearsal dinner, about when we met, really kind of bring me back down to reality. This wedding is about love, it's a love that Kris and I have. There's no need for any of this drama, and let's just enjoy every moment. &gt;&gt; JORDAN: I kind of noticed little changes. He went from wearing, like, PF Flyers to start wearing YSL's. He'd come to the game with, like, a Louis Vuitton tie case. You know, like, it went from, like, "We're just kind of talking" to he's texting on the plane, like, "Man, that's my baby. That's my baby." I'm like, "Dang, really? It changed like that so fast?" I wish you guys nothing but the best. 1113 00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:38,188 Thank you for upgrading my boy. Thank you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi! &gt;&gt; SHARON: Hi! &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? Kris and I are getting our marriage license today. So Sharon and her assistant set it all up so they can just make it really easy. Shall we get started? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Let's get started. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Are you so excited? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so excited. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Your first name? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kimberly. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: And your middle name? &gt;&gt; KIM: Noelle. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Can you spell your last name for me? &gt;&gt; KIM: K-A-R-D-A-S-H-I-A-N. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: And is this your name at birth? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay, and... are you going to change your name? &gt;&gt; KIM: I guess it's the right thing to do. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You can do anything you want. &gt;&gt; SHARON: You don't have to use the name on certain things, you can just use the Kardashian. But on legal things, it would be Kardashian-Humphries. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm honestly really torn between changing my last name for my future husband. But then I think it'll be such a mistake business-wise. So, I don't really know what I'm going to do. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's for you. My gosh! Rob, you look just like Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You said you wanted some of your dad's old stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that the color? &gt;&gt; KIM: My dad always wore these. 1140 00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:06,744 : Going through these clothes is kind of a lot. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Are you going to change your name? &gt;&gt; KIM: I guess it's the right thing to do. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You don't have to. You can do anything you want. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think on all legal documents I need to be Kardashian. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So no change? No change. Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I just make a decision and go for it. Kardashian for life, baby. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kris-- I need him. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hi. Kris. &gt;&gt; SHARON: This is Kim. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hi. &gt;&gt; SHARON: I didn't know what to give you and Kris. This is 20 bottles of champagne in here. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Really? No, it's not. &gt;&gt; SHARON: It's Armand de Brignac, Ace of Spades. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Appreciate it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So, Kris, you're going to sign... right here. This is your application for certified copies. Okay, so I want you to sign right here and your maiden name. Well, you're not changing it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: She doesn't want to change her name right now? A part of me thought that Kim was going to change her name for the marriage license. At this point, I feel like I'm not even getting married and I just don't care. &gt;&gt; KIM: For legal documents, I'm going to have to sign Kardashian on all my Kardashian stuff. So, I'll do, like, Kim Kardashian-Humphries on, like, my license, but... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Just stay Kardashian-- it's all good. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Now, do you guys have 1170 00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,834 photo I.D.'s? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kim, you all ready for the wedding? Kim, are you getting butterflies? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's for you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, my little sweet, innocent son. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at his bow-tie. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that nice? Very cute. Who is that? Is that Uncle Bob? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow. &gt;&gt; ROB: A little belly, but that's okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did you lose a few? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That looks great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! You look amazing. &gt;&gt; ROB: Like a scumbag. &gt;&gt; KIM: So handsome, so sexy. &gt;&gt; ROB: Whoa. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You look like you're 007-- wow. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You almost look like a gentleman. James Bond? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, seriously, Rob, you look just like Dad. Like, he used to dress up in, like, these tuxes. Seeing Rob in his tux totally reminds me of my dad. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Can you say, "Hi, Papa?" &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES : Well, thank you, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: My dad was always, like, so the voice of reason, so I think that I would probably be less stressed if he was here. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Right here, right here, right here, Robert. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Oh, my God, that is so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: But nothing can really prepare you for these are the big moments that, you know, you wish your dad was here. Wait, how much does he look like Dad in this tux? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, you look so nice. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, like seriously, remember those pictures of Mom and Dad... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look so nice. &gt;&gt; KIM: They would go to these, like, black-tie parties? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, is that Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's me. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: How are you, big guy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You said you wanted some of your dad's old stuff, so I went to storage. You wanted to incorporate something into your dress, that's what I was told? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I think that's a great idea. Some of his old jackets. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let me see if one looks, like, familiar to me. I think the best way to have a piece of my dad be with me during the wedding is to take one of his shirts. I'm going to have a heart cut out of it, and sewn into the heart of each one of my dresses. Hold this up to you. I want to see how short he was compared to you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think those are going to quite work. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're like... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: He wasn't that tall. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He was only 5'8". One thing I liked about your father is even though, you know, he was devastated by the whole divorce and the way it came down, your dad always respected me, you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And that meant a lot. That's why I could have a good relationship with him. You know? You know it shows you he had good character. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that the color? &gt;&gt; KIM: My dad always wore these. And we need something light. This is so it. It's been, like, eight years since my father passed away, but I'm going through the clothes, and, you know, all these memories are coming up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How are you holding up? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You sure? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's, like, stressful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you just want to 1235 00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:56,433 get it over with? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did I say something? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want a minute. 1239 00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:09,713 Going through these clothes is kind of a lot. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Are you not yourself when you're around me? &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't know, like, a whole half of my life, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. Thank you so much. I didn't expect her to do something so sweet and so generous for me. Kim's got the most amazing heart. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you crying about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, seeing these shirts and stuff, knowing my dad wore them, it's just, like, so much, you know? It's, like, been so stressful and so much about, like, how much does this cost and this cost? Like, it's, like, I'm forgetting what all of this is supposed to be about. Like, seeing all those clothes, it's, like, just, like, a lot to deal with. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's all right. It's okay. I'll get you through this, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, hard because I can't really, like, be emotional in front of Kris, and I don't want to be. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, like, he didn't know my dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, different, you know. I'm, like, stressing out and taking it all out on Kris. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: But there's, like, moments where I'm just, like, I wish my dad was here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I wish he was here, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: To, like, see it all. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: I realize that I've been taking so many frustrations out on Kris, and I've been, like, just not really remembering what the whole purpose of this whole event is about. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think your dad would love Kris. And Kris is a really good person. You know how proud your father would be of you? And you've got to live your life to be, you know, in his honor, you know. And you're a good person, you know. You're nice to people, and you're a good businesswoman, and you're a kind person. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I hate that, like, on the outside it's all about, like, the material things, and, like, all about all of that. It's, like, not who we are. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I agree, but it's nice but it doesn't really... it's not life, it's not life. It's not what life's about. It's about family. And I'll get you down the aisle. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: With all your diamonds and beautiful dress... and all that stuff, I'll get you down the aisle, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce is like my dad. He knows what to say to comfort me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It'll be okay, baby. All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously, I don't know what I would do if you weren't here to walk me down. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, don't you worry, I will be there in my new tux. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hey, big guy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now am I gonna see you on the golf course tomorrow? No. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You'll see me whenever you want to see me. I'm on point. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You were crying? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. I just had a moment. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you, bye. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Baby, you've never, like, done that around me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, I feel like I hold it in. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Are you not yourself when you're around me? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I am, I just, like... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I love you. I just hope that, like, one day, if you're down about something, you can let it out around me... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just sad. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't know, like, a whole half of my life, you know? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just weird, and, like, hard at a time like this, when I do want my dad here. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: With how moody Kim's been lately, I didn't really, like, think about the father aspect and her missing her dad. Maybe, for now, she should keep her last name and at least always have that part of him. I feel sad that, like, you have all these memories of him, and I want to share the memory of your dad, but, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: I think he would have loved you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm here for you, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just seeing how supportive Kris is with me when he knows I'm going through a really hard time just makes me remember why I love him so much and why he's the man that I'm marrying. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you still gonna want this, honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Kylie, I discovered, is really, really a smart kid. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What'd she do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's this new Web site she found because she wants to go to Hawaii on a family vacation. I told her, "No, it's too expensive," and she went on to this Web site called Living Social and found everything for, like, 50% off. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good for her. Okay. I've got more imp... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I wasn't going to take her to Hawaii, but now I just might. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, honey, honey... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I actually found massages, like, a whole massage package. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, okay, okay... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Twice the massages. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's fabulous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You should be happy; I might actually be calm for once in my life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Doubt it. Okay, let's get to the important stuff. I was just at Kim's, and we went through Robert's clothes, and she found this shirt, which is the one she wants somehow sewn into her wedding dress, you know. I guess you were going to meet Vera, and she wants you to give it to her. Anyway, I felt sorry for Kim, and she's just, like, she lost it, man. She was, like, crying, but, uh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. Actually, it-it wasn't easy, but, um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is the second time you're going to walk somebody down the aisle. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, my stepkids. Both of them. God, you know what's amazing is I just, how my life has kind of turned out. I'm much closer to my stepkids, by far, than I am my genetic kids. You know, and I just wish, you know, they knew how much I love them and appreciate them. Not being as close to my other four kids sometimes can be a little bit tough. Sharing Kim's emotional reaction makes you think that we can spend a little bit more time together and get a little closer. You know, it's tough. You know, your time is so limited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, and it goes by really, really fast. I mean, one minute Kim was four, and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now she's getting married. 1360 01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:16,980 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't get me started. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I won't. &gt;&gt; KIM: We should go to that sushi place one time. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: They have a really cute pet store in there. For my favorite pets. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Awww... &gt;&gt; KIM: I know what to do to make you happy. Say, "I love pets." I love dogs. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Straight still? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right, I'm trying to figure out where we're going. You just told me to drive. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, so we're going to the cemetery. It's kind of weird. Now that we're back to normal again, I feel like I can really open up to Kris, and I can really share a part of my life that I was kind of holding back from him. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Do you know where we're going? &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought it was down there, but look. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wow. Your grandfather lived until '98. He was '03. &gt;&gt; KIM: Having Kris with me to visit my dad's grave, I mean, I'm bringing two big parts of my world together that are so important to me, and kind of merging them. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I wish I would have had a chance to meet him. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know if it's, like a weird thing that we don't come here; like, none of us do. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You know that your dad's in Heaven, so, like, you can see him and talk to him whenever you want. You really just go to bed, say a prayer, you know feel him there. It's really special to be here with Kim and take a moment out of the craziness and remember it's more about family and creating memories with family and not about the perfect little 1391 01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:02,552 napkin in the right spot. It's okay to cry. I'm done fighting from here on out. We need to just have a great wedding. My heart's racing. I'm having a hard time breathing. I'm so nervous. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, we go. 1398 01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:18,234 &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm going to have a breakdown. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She should practice running in heels. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, I hope she has some really comfortable shoes to wear because it's going to be a really long day. I hope she's awake. Kim...? I think I'm having an anxiety attack. It's just too quiet over here for me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, I could not wake up. Like, literally my eyes are closed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Who's that from? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They are so gorg. "This is your fairy tale and we love you, Lamar and Khloe." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a wedding day people. Mason. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Wait, let me tell you something. Kiki is getting married today, so can you say-- can you give her a kiss? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Okay, I need a hug. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, have some coffee. &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot wake up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Drink that soda, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, literally, Khloe, I can not open my eyes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh my gosh, look at this gold bottle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to go. 1423 01:08:38,381 --> 01:08:42,452 We have to get to the house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You go first. &gt;&gt; KIM: When I pull into the venue at the wedding, it is just, like, pure heaven. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wow, roses. &gt;&gt; SHARON: This is my dream. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So this is the koi pond right here. &gt;&gt; SHARON: And there's the cross up there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So pretty. &gt;&gt; SHARON: It's all crystal. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, tres fab. Oh, I love all the centerpieces. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Aren't the Lalique swans amazing? 1435 01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:23,026 &gt;&gt; KIM: This is more than I ever could have dreamed of. Sharon honestly created my dream wedding. I couldn't ask for anything better. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is phenomenal. &gt;&gt; KIM: Amazing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Where's your tux at, bro? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got an hour and a half. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You can't wear your track suit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It'll take me two minutes. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Oh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Poor Kris Humphries. This guy is so nervous. I mean, not only is he getting married, he's getting married in this most elaborate, over the top wedding. He's 26 years old, and, uh, he's nervous. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Let me grab Bruce for a second. So, um... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hmm? It's the big one, big guy. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: The way, uh, you know, Kim was around you the other day made me just see that, like, you really are a great dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Not just a stepdad, this is more than that, so that was... Thanks for being there for her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, these kids are not just my stepkids, they're more than that. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Bruce is really connected with Kim. It's really great that he's in her life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, I was very fortunate to have them in my life, but hey, I made my share of mistakes, I guarantee you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, you learn. Life is about learning. And I'm glad to teach you as much as I can. If you ever need a little wisdom, I don't know everything, but I have had a lot of experience. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kimmy, this is, like, on another level. Oh, my God, you guys. Kim bought me these earrings. Oh, my God, Kim, thank you. I love you so much. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Say whatever you want Kim wearing three wedding dresses or having a beautiful extravagant wedding, but she's always doing something for somebody else. She's got the most amazing heart. I love you. Thank you so much. I didn't expect her to do something so sweet and so generous for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you crying about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. I don't know. I was just so shocked. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I was crying in the background. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sorry, I thought I was going to cry off all the makeup right now. &gt;&gt; MAN: Aw, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 30 minutes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Please don't make me cry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just want to hug you. &gt;&gt; WILLIAM: I can't believe you're getting married. Holy crap. It's finally sunk in. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You get engaged, and then you set the date. It's just like time flies. &gt;&gt; WILLIAM: You'll know you married the right woman when you screw up, because you will screw up, doing certain things, and whatever and how patient she is and nurtures you back up. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I love you, man. Really, how does the mustache look? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You look like Don Juan. You're rolling with it, it looks amazing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Do you like it, though? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Remember, you've got to look at these pictures 20 or 30 years from now. Okay? May seem cool today. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I didn't take you in here to tell me not to rock the mustache. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, that's exactly right. &gt;&gt; MAN: He looks terrible with a mustache. &gt;&gt; WILLIAM: He's going to spend the rest of his life explaining to his kids what happened. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Enjoy. &gt;&gt; MAN: Lamar, how you doing brother? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Girls gone wild. &gt;&gt; MAN: I like your dance, Lamar. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Right in your face, bro. Right in your face. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Thank you so much, enjoy. &gt;&gt; SHARON: I know you're doing her makeup, but I was asked to come over here and bring you a gift from your groom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God. This is so insane. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How pretty. I saw it last night. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I already saw it, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kris surprised Kim with a beautiful diamond bracelet. She normally picks out every gift that everyone gives her, so she was definitely surprised and I know she loves it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look what Kris just sent over to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; M.J.: Oh, my Lord. &gt;&gt; KIM: I absolutely love the gift that Kris gave me. It's a knot and it has two dangling K's, and it's just so beautiful and it's so thoughtful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: To die for. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So fab. 1526 01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,657 &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I got to run and go get ready. &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: What a home, huh? It's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm going to shave my mustache right before I go out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Bible? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Bible. Growing the mustache was the last bit of control that I had over this whole wedding situation, but it was in my plan all along to shave my mustache right before the wedding. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, shave your mustache and then we're going to 1536 01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:17,620 do this. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Give me a hug. Suiting up for the wedding, my heart's racing, I'm having a hard time breathing, I'm so nervous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt! Sisters! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here she comes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kimberly, you look amazing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like a princess. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, this is so phenomenal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim looks absolutely gorgeous. She looks like a princess with her diamond headpiece. Her makeup is flawless, her hair is perfect. She picks the perfect dress to walk down the aisle. I can't wait for everyone to see her. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm freaking a little bit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Take a deep breath. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't want to cry yet. I, like, cried already, like, twice today. Hey, what time is it, anyone? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It's 6:15. &gt;&gt; KIM: So let's go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go. 1556 01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,510 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Let's rock and roll, baby. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Man, my wife is walking down the aisle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really do see Kim and Kris and the love that they have. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's really a magical moment. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, look at all those helicopters. &gt;&gt; MAN: It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Just hold on. You're fine here. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I walk up first, and all eyes are on me. I'm excited, but I'm so nervous at the same time. I mean, this is the moment that you think about your whole life, and I'm actually in this moment. This is about to happen. Oh, my God, I'm going to have a breakdown. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Last time we did this, it was your turn. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. Now it's your, uh, your other baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe it's here. It's my daughter's wedding day. There's no better feeling in the world. It's like, you want to just 1578 01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,405 freeze this moment in time, so that it lasts forever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look good. &gt;&gt; MAN: You look great. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is exactly how I'd picture Kim's wedding to be-- elegant, glamorous, very Zsa Zsa. This is, like, her fairy tale wedding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look beautiful, Khloe. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here, Mase, hold. Yes? Okay, bring that to Mom. 1587 01:17:16,532 --> 01:17:19,969 Get 'em, buddy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at Mason, he's running. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, hold my hand, baby. Okay. Okay. Ooh! Oh, my God. Okay, come here. Thank you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Don't steal my show, little man. &gt;&gt; KIM: How's he doing, Bruce? He was cute. You okay, baby? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm all right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want to say something. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? Don't make me cry. Just down the aisle. I don't want to cry right now. I can't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought I was going to be a lunatic the day of my wedding, but I am so calm. I am so ready for this moment. This is it. Like, Kris and I are meant to be here. We're meant to be married and be husband and wife. 1608 01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:17,893 &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, we go. 1611 01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,720 1613 01:19:13,716 --> 01:19:17,186 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; PASTOR: You may be seated. On behalf of Kim and Kris and their respective families, I want to welcome you to this celebration of marriage. Who gives Kim to be married to Kris? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My wife Kris and I do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. Good luck. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm gonna go this way. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: Kim, Kris, this is a day you have long waited for. When you were a little girl, you thought about this day. You thought about the dress you would wear, the people who would come, the venue that you would be in, but most importantly, you wondered who would be the man beside you. This is the man. And, Kris, when you were a little boy, well, you didn't think about this day a whole lot. But as you grew into a young man, certainly you thought about who would be the woman beside you. This is the woman. Kim says of you, Kris, that "You put a smile on my face every day. You are the ying to my yang. You bring calm to my life. You ground me." She appreciates your trust. She's never had a doubt in the journey that you would be the one to come alongside of her, she says. "You help me not to take everything so seriously." And, Kim, this is what Kris says about you. "First of all, you are compassionate. I can't help but see how compassionate you are now, and how you will be with our family, hopefully, one day." Secondly, he says you're driven. You treat every day like it would be your last. And the third is you're family oriented. They're everything. And you know how very proud your family is of you, including your father, who's watching down on us today. Kris, Kim, it's time now for you to share your vows with each other. Kris, repeat after me. Kim, I love you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim, I love you. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: And take you to be my wedded wife. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: And take you to be my wedded wife. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: To have and to hold from this day forward. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: To have and to hold from this day forward. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: Till death do us part. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Till death do us part. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: Kim, repeat after me. Kris, I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris, I love you. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: And take you to be my wedded husband. &gt;&gt; KIM: And take you to be my wedded husband. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: To have and to hold from this day forward. &gt;&gt; KIM: To have and to hold from this day forward. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: Till death do us part. &gt;&gt; KIM: Till death do us part. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: Kris, repeat after me. Kim, as a symbol of my love for you... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim, as a symbol of my love for you... &gt;&gt; PASTOR: With this ring... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: With this ring... &gt;&gt; PASTOR: I thee wed. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I thee wed. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: Kim, repeat after me. Kris, as a symbol of my love for you... &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris, as a symbol of my love for you... &gt;&gt; PASTOR: With this ring... &gt;&gt; KIM: With this ring... &gt;&gt; PASTOR: I thee wed. &gt;&gt; KIM: I thee wed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seeing Kim this giddy and happy it's, like, the cutest thing ever. Seeing this, really makes me feel so much better. If this is what Kris does for her, oh, my God, I'm all for it. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: In accord with the laws of the State of California, I pronounce you husband and wife. 1680 01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:45,060 Kris, you may kiss your bride. Friends and family, it is a delight to present, for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Kris 1684 01:22:51,934 --> 01:22:56,605 Humphries. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's married. 1687 01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:04,246 My baby's married. This is what life is all about. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really do see Kim and Kris and the love that they have, and I do wish them all the happiness and laughter in the world. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Baby, you're my wife now. &gt;&gt; KIM: How weird is that? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Now you're stuck 1694 01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:25,067 with me forever. &gt;&gt; KIM: Perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They did it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have a new brother-in-law. &gt;&gt; KIM: This way for photos. Do you like my dress? 1699 01:23:38,814 --> 01:23:41,517 It's a princess dress. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I love it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Papa. How are you? You look amazing. The best part about walking down the aisle was I saw my grandpa. He's my dad's dad. He's 95 years old. I didn't think he was going to be able to make it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Great to meet you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mason, this is your great grandpa. I think my dad was looking down on us. I think that he would be so enjoying this moment. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Right here, please. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Probably the best part of this wedding is you very rarely ever have the opportunity to get the entire family together. I appreciate you guys being here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It was really nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was nice. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It was. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Anytime there's a divorce and the kids are young, I think it's probably tougher on them than it is on anybody. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Kris was nervous. I could see he was so nervous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The only question is now... who's next? &gt;&gt; ALL: Oh... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Who's next to beat you in golfing is the real conversation here. That's what we've been talking about. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what we need to do? We need to plan, like, a trip to Wyoming, and bring the whole group. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. You know, we've had struggles throughout the years. I certainly regret those things, but to be able to spend really good quality time with them, um, means the world to me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: The one time that I ever needed to play a good hole, I played it in front of him. You were excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I saw genuine excitement in his eyes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I did. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He's like, "That's my boy." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I pawn it off as "those are my genes." It was wonderful. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It was my... it was my Olympics. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look stunning. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you ready? I'm changing into my second gown for my first dance with Kris. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't do that in this dress. Not in this. &gt;&gt; ROBIN THICKE: It is my honor and my pleasure to introduce the bride and groom. Ladies and gentlemen, the beautiful Ms. Kim and Mr. Kris Humphries. ♫ All the things I've done before this ♫ They don't mean a thing And all the words spoken before this won't be said again... ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: To hear Robin Thicke, this is so magical and it's just my dream come true. We are just taking in this whole moment and enjoying each other. &gt;&gt; THICKE: ♫ Angel ♫ &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'll grab my mom, you grab Bruce. 1750 01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:34,823 &gt;&gt; THICKE: ♫ My angel... ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To have an opportunity to dance with Kim is really extraordinarily special. You know, we've been very close throughout the years, and I'm happy for her. &gt;&gt; THICKE: ♫ My darling angel 1756 01:26:54,810 --> 01:27:01,516 My darling angel, now Whoo! ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I'm going to go change. I just have one more change for the night, and I'm eager to show off my Old Hollywood sexy satin look. Like my new dress? Much more easy to walk in, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What up, Brooklyn? We are so happy for our sister, Kim and Kris. This day and Kim being married, it's made me realize I need to be more open and inviting to Kris and to whatever Kim wants, really. That's my sister, and if my sister's happy, I'm happy for her. I want you guys to get on the dance floor. &gt;&gt; KIM: It just feels good to just know that everyone's just enjoying the night and there's so much love in this room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Once again, my family is going to expand and get bigger and bigger and bigger. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's our baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's been amazing what's going on with our family, and I'm so thankful for all the blessings. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Would you marry me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: You are husband and wife. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so blessed for how much love we have between us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love my family, they are the world to me. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: It's a boy. And there he is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm really proud of all of my kids and the choices that they've made. And Kris makes an amazing addition. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're so pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot believe that the night has gone by so fast. This is all we wanted was for everyone to come together, have such a good time. This was, honestly, such a dream come true. 1789 01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:22,958 It really was my fairy tale wedding.
