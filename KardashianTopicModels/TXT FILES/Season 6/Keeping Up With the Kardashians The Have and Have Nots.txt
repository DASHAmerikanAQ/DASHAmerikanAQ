- &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do you guys know how to rope it or no? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I can rope it. Start with the right one. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Big, big, big. Move in, move in, move in a little. 6 00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,884 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'll go in first 'cause you always distract me. Cinderella dressed in yellow... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. I don't think I could ever do this. This is some complicated over here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys. Hi, girls. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, it's your turn. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, I'm not jumping rope, you guys. I don't know how to do this. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, you got it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One more time. One more time. Wait. I think I have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to pee myself. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hold on, wait for me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so con... She just jumped, and she has to pee all of a sudden? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom's peeing in her pants. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom definitely has a history of peeing on herself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I totally just wet my pants. I just wet my pants. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, she needs to take care of the problem. At a black tie function, you can't be peeing on yourself. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, you're still peeing in your pants. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop, Kourtney. Once in a while, it comes out. I can't help it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. I don't think she's, like, trying to, like, bash you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just saying you should get it checked out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's saying, like, hello, get it checked out. Once, okay-- maybe you really had to go and I made you laugh. I don't know, but you smell like 35 00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,092 a pee pad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, what are you doing? Be a good girl, honey. Kylie, Kylie, Kylie, Kylie, Kylie, Kylie. Okay, Wendy's made a really nice dinner, okay? So go and be a good girl and sit down next to Mommy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, so we're at this family dinner, and I'd so rather be with my friends at a movie. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why aren't you eating your salad? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's not my fave. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nothing is her fave. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. Kylie, remember the rule. No phones at the table. How many times have I told you to get off the phone? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What can be this important? Come on, hang up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My movie started five minutes ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not going to the movies right now. You're staying for dinner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm really scared to try it. No, uh-uh. I don't like the texture. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Eat your dinner. You eat your dinner, and then you can go to the movie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Everyone is waiting for me at the movies. So I'm going to go. But it was so nice talking to you guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, sit down. I really think this is Kris's and my fault. We've been very blessed. You know, Kendall and Kylie have had everything that they've wanted. And I really feel like my responsibility as a parent is to show them what reality really is. Let's go. Eat your main course, then you can go. Let's go right now. Let's go right now. 66 00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,280 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love teenagers-- love them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Those are cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would have to see it on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have the same exact taste. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, we're in a public place. So it's rude. My kids love to give me a hard time. But when it becomes really personal and they do it in front of complete strangers, it's just not cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, did you just go in there and pee? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. I told you, cut it out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You should buy yellow sunglasses, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And why might that be, my darling? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's going to go with your new wardrobe that you buy. The yellow collection. Kris has a bladder problem, and I'm going to tease her until she goes to the doctor and gets it checked out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's customers over there trying on clothes. They all know me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you gone to the doctor yet? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't say anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. I really don't think that this is a problem that needs the attention of a doctor. This is a very little problem. I don't have time to go running to the doctor every time I have a leak. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you make pregnant people walk up those stairs to go urinate? &gt;&gt; SALESPERSON: They do. It's really unfortunate. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom isn't pregnant, but she has a bladder of, like, a 20-month pregnant person. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A real plane-- bam! A lot of times on Saturday mornings I go to the helipark, and it's fun, 'cause there's a lot of kids around. You inspire them to get into the sport and try it. Like this, see? You're going backwards, upside down and backwards. &gt;&gt; BOY: Oh, this is way too complicated. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is about two years of work. You know, it's kind of like my little hobby. I wish my kids would be there more often. You know what, I don't think Kendall and Kylie have really ever even seen me fly my helicopter. &gt;&gt; BOY: Amazing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Amazing, huh? It's kind of fun, isn't it? Hello. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hi. Who am I speaking with? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bruce Jenner. I get a phone call from the credit card fraud investigation. I know immediately what's going on here. Kendall and Kylie, in the past, have snuck out with my credit card. They just think it's, like, the magic card where you can in and buy anything you want. Doesn't work that way. Thank you for calling. I appreciate it. Girls. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: In Kylie's room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's going on?! I get a call from the credit card company wanting me to approve charges on my credit card over clothes. What's going on, girls? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We went shopping. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How did you get the credit card? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, we've borrowed the card before. Like, it's not that big a deal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, it is a big deal. It's called stealing-- taking my credit card. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Take me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not funny! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's not that big of a deal, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where's my credit card? Where is it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hand over the plastic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Give it to me. Don't fool around. Just give it to me. I'm getting ticked off. This whole credit card thing's kind of like the last straw for me. These girls have to understand the value of money, about hard work. I got to do something. First thing in the morning, you know what, we're taking it all back. End of story. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom will let us keep 140 00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,532 'em, Kylie. It's okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe, where are we going? Should I bring my bag or anything? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: My camera? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: How beautiful is this? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so pretty. Where are you taking me, and how do you know this trail? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Take your shoes off. &gt;&gt; KIM: Carry me, carry me. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I can't. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love Malibu. How romantical. Kris and I are definitely a lot more serious. 152 00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,367 We definitely talk about, you know, our future together. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: They say this is the most beautiful spot for the most beautiful girl that I know. 156 00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,544 &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you know, what do you say? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's it going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, dolls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You, too. How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would like to have the chicken special. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Chicken special. Chicken marsala. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ooh. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Chicken curry. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A very nice presentation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, there it is. So, Bruce, do you remember when we were living on Abington? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we made that little tape. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause we decided it was a good idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No more beer for you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, but were you really thinking about... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you... give me this glass of beer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I swear I made a sex tape. Nobody else knows. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was the '90s. It was cool then. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was immediately destroyed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How long was this tape? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, we cut it up. It was, like, 15 minutes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hours and hours and hours. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think I was looking through the window. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 15 minutes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's all we had. 15 minutes. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, who wants to be in there longer than that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take her beer. Take her beer, please. Don't laugh too hard, leaky-leak. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What you got, backened up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, seriously. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me out, I have to go to the bathroom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm... no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just let me out, I have to go pee. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, you let her out. Just clench. Clench and make the face. Grr! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my gosh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Child abuse. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, everything's good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Doing good. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Are the spices okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everything's good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Everything was very delicious. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get me theout of this booth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Are you leaking? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, cut it out. Why are you guys so rude to me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let her out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I want out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get out of the booth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, can I, like, see it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's rude. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe. Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, really? Damn it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You wouldn't get up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She didn't ask me to get up; she only asked Khloe. I feel really bad, but Khloe and I are definitely not going to let this one go. She needs to get it checked out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think it's time to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I have my purse? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sometimes these kids can just kind of go overboard. It really pisses me off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was so rude. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now I feel bad. I didn't know it was, like, that serious and intense. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They know how I feel about it. I mean, it's embarrassing. And so mean. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is an old person's problem. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You do have stress incontinence. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel betrayed by my own body. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My dad's making Kylie and I volunteer at this homeless shelter. &gt;&gt; GIRL: This is our room. That's my dad's bed. That's my sister's bed. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's, like, the size of my bedroom, their whole home. &gt;&gt; KIM: You hungry? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so hungry. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Hey, girls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just gonna go with the Chinese chicken salad. I don't even have to look. Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom and Bruce. Mom, have you gotten an appointment yet to check out your leaky vag? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are not to mess with me again. Because that was embarrassing. And not funny. I'm not even speaking to Khloe right now. I'm still annoyed about what happened at the restaurant the other night. But maybe I do have a little problem, and I should probably go to the doctor and get it checked out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, seriously, it's not the end of the world. Who cares if you have a little leaky vagina? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just glad we didn't have pea soup. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, I thought Kendall and Kylie were coming to eat with us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, they stayed at home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They've been at that stage that you girls were many years ago. You know, they're 13 and 15. I don't think they really know how fortunate they are to have the lifestyle that they live. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's such a fine line, too, as, like, a parent. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want to give them everything, but then you don't want them to be brats. But you are going to have some major bitches on your hands if you don't do something about this soon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Years ago, when I was on the US team, I traveled all through the Soviet Union and saw such poverty, such devastation of lives, of nobody happy. I mean, just horrible stuff. And I kept saying back then, when I get an age and I have kids, I want those kids to see this. You know? And experience this, and realize that most of the world, you know, lives below poverty level. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. I was thinking about maybe taking them to a mission, or downtown L.A., or to help people... &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that's a really good idea. I think going to the mission will teach them what real life is about. When I was growing up, my dad took Kourtney and I to Skid Row. That was such an eye-opening experience, and it really made me value what we have. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They just gotta see more of the other side of life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think you should do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, when are you going to go? 'Cause I want to go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I-I would love you to come. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would love to go. I have to go to New York this week for the Sears meeting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll go, as long as Scott will hang with Mason. Maybe Scott should go with you, actually, instead, 'cause he needs to learn a thing or two. 283 00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,433 &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's not a bad idea. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie. Come with me, we have to talk. Kendall, in here. All right. I've been pretty disappointed with you girls lately. My job as a dad is to keep life in proper perspective for you guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What are you talking about, Dad? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, to be honest with you, you don't understand the value of a dollar, you don't understand... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, actually, the value of a dollar is... going down. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Going down, yeah, so it's worth less. You need to make more. So, we are going to do something that'll help keep life in perspective. Maybe you'll appreciate your life a little bit more after, okay? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, we gotta go. Our friends are waiting for us. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Peace out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. 302 00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,213 I will, uh, keep in touch. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom reluctantly agreed to go to the doctor, so I'm going to go with her and hope that nothing is majorly wrong. &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: Why don't you have a seat, and the doctor will be with you shortly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just kind of nervous. Since 17 years old, I've been coming here, for all these years. And suddenly I'm coming for, like, I'm going through menopause, and I have all these weird issues, and my bladder leaks. This is, like, an old person's problem. I feel like it really sucks to get old, and sometimes I feel betrayed by my own body. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you ready? &gt;&gt; CRANE: How are you guys? Yes. Well, what brings you in, anyway? &gt;&gt; KRIS: My bladder kind of leaks when I do things like, I was jumping rope with Kendall and Kylie. I never saw myself having a problem like this before. &gt;&gt; CRANE: But you do have six kids. It makes things a little looser, in terms of the muscle. Menopause contributes to a certain degree, as well. Um, you do these Kegel exercises? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what I was going to say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, the last time somebody told me to do a Kegel exercise, it was, like, to get your... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For sexual reasons? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CRANE: You should be doing those anyway. Okay. So let's just have a look. So do me a favor, take a little breath and cough for a minute. CRANE: Now do a Kegel, right now. Now, see, you have to work on those. Okay. You do have a little bit of what we would call stress incontinence, which is very common even if you've only had a couple kids. But you can help that, distinctly, by doing these exercises. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's pretty normal for women to have this problem. I probably should have come to the doctor a long time ago. But I'm here now, and that's all that matters. &gt;&gt; CRANE: All right, well, I'll see you guys later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks so much, Dr. Crane. &gt;&gt; CRANE: My pleasure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I honestly have not stopped doing Kegel exercises since we left the office. I'm doing them right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We can do them at the same time, and you have to do... &gt;&gt; KRIS: One, two three. One, two, three. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then relax for five. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. The family that Kegels together, stays together. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're here to help people. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I got it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, I love you for doing this, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My dad's making Kylie and I volunteer at this homeless shelter. It's the last thing I want to do right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hand wash. That's enough, Kendall. Don't abuse the right... What are you going to do, take a shower in here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This hand sanitizer is life-changing. I'm a germaphobe. I just want to leave. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't waste all the soap. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's a little intimidating because I'm going 366 00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,627 into the mission not really knowing what to expect. &gt;&gt; ANDY BALES: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. Hi, nice to... &gt;&gt; BALES: Welcome to Union Rescue Mission. This is the floor where all the guys that are in the long-term 372 00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:41,507 recovery program. Here's the kids. Brought some friends to play here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall, Kylie. This one's Kylie right here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're sisters. &gt;&gt; GIRL: You look like twins. &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: I'm Miranda. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who's going to catch the football? &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: This is my sister. &gt;&gt; TEE: I'm Tee. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm Kylie. Your nose, did that hurt? &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: Yeah, I did. And they thought I cried, but I didn't, 'cause it only makes one side of your face water. So I had this side. And my mom dared me to get it, so I had to do it. So, I don't back down from her dares. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My mom would dare me not to get it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BALES: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kourt! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Kenny. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I didn't even know that was you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's dinnertime. They want us to go down to the kitchen. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; TEE: What's your favorite color? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Purple. &gt;&gt; TEE: Yes, I love you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God, I like purple, also. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The food at the shelter doesn't look so great. I kind of feel bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why aren't you eating your salad? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's not my fave. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sorry, Wendy. &gt;&gt; WENDY: It's okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what to tell you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There you go, buddy. &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: Did you guys want to see my room? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: My room? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Sure. &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: You guys are about to enter my room. Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: Dad, this is... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello. &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: ...Kylie and Kendall. This is my dad. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kylie. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hello. Nice to meet you. We walk into Miranda and Tee's room, and it's not only Miranda and Tee living there, it's them and their dad. &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: This is our room. This is my bed. That's my dad's bed. That's my sister's bed. Um, closet. And that's basically our room. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's kind of eye-opening. It's, like, the size of my bedroom-- their whole home. &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: We have, like, a bathroom right here. It's not so big, but it's good enough. So... It's nothing much though, but... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Their whole life is in that room. It's really sad to me that 421 00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,829 someone lives in that little space as their home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I called this company, and they were, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: "We want you to be our new spokesperson." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guess who has the last 427 00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,943 laugh now, ladies? Whoo-hoo! Â - &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: You guys want a tour around the...? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Sure. So you've been living in this room for a year now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall and Kylie have always lived in a beautiful home. It's really interesting to see kind of their eyes open up. I think they're learning a lot. &gt;&gt; BALES: There's no place like this in the U.S. other than Skid Row, where so many people live on the streets, and so much drug dealing in the daylight. Violence that goes on. &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: I got friends down there. I know some people through my dad. We grew up with some of them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think this is a good wake-up call for Kendall and Kylie to realize that they have so many blessings. They should never take anything for granted. Where did you guys live before you were here? &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: Um, Seattle. We're actually from Seattle. I was born there, and then, like, when he went to jail, we were, like, in foster care out there for, like, maybe a year and, like, two months. And then we moved... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, who went to jail? &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: My dad. My mom, she was out here. She was messing up, using drugs and stuff like that. And then she would, like, disappear for, like, three days or something. And then she'd come back and then leave again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Miranda tells me about her background and how she ended up in the homeless shelter. But she's so smart and positive and has such a bright future ahead of her. &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: We've been here for the longest since, like, August. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And you're much happier here? &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: I mean, I'm not so happy. I've been stressed out a lot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: 'Cause it's, like, too much for me on my plate. But it's all right. It's cool. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Miranda really shows me the possibilities of what life could be. It kind of just makes me appreciate more what I do have. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can we go on the slide? &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm actually really happy that my dad brought me here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you for showing us. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're my soul sister. Maybe sometimes Kylie and I do act a little bratty about some of the things we do, and it really makes me appreciate everything that I have. That's it, right? &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: All right, text me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; MIRANDA: We'll text back. Bye, you guys. &gt;&gt; TEE: Bye, you guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It was nice meeting you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, you crack eggs so bizarrely. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How do you crack eggs? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, first of all, did you guys wash your hands before doing this? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I actually did upstairs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm so sure that happened. Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, well, well. There's my beautiful and fabulous daughters who are always so nice to me. Look what I got. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tampons? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, these are little pads that protect you from, like, tinkling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just when your period stops, you still got to wear pads for peeing problems. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got an endorsement deal for this company. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I called them and said, "I've got a problem. Do you guys want to play ball?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And they were like, "We want you to be our new spokesperson." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to embrace this. I have scored the most amazing endorsement deal for an adult liner pad for light bladder leakage. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So now you can laugh as hard as you want. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you can squirt all night and day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is Kris-- you have a problem, let's not make it a problem, let's make it a business venture. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guess who has the last 506 00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,517 laugh now, ladies. Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guess who has... 509 00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,857 &gt;&gt; ALL: ...the last laugh now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's really important to bring awareness to light bladder leakage. It's a condition that I have, and that one out of three women 514 00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,745 has the same thing. Okay, I got to pee. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, girls. Because I'm always so busy, I want to spend more time with Kendall and Kylie. Aha! Okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, Scott is going to Vegas to host a party. I just don't want him to go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's drinks everywhere. What do you want from me? It's Vegas.
