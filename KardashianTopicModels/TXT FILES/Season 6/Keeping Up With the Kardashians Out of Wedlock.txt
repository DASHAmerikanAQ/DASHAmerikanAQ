- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Previously on Keeping Up With the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sitting here, I have a son that's almost a year old, and I feel like at this point of my life, why am I not just buying an engagement ring? Being married is a beautiful thing in life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't want a wedding at all? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right now... I'm pretty happy with the way things are. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know what, there's this one spot on my butt, I swear... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Come on, man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: My butt itches. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo. That was flagrant. &gt;&gt; ROB: The corner, to scratch my butt. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Nah, nah, nah, nah... &gt;&gt; ROB: A bear... a bear has to use atree and &gt;&gt; LAMAR: A bear uses a rabbit. &gt;&gt; ROB: A rabbit? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hundred percent. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, he does not. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You didn't learn that in school? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This conversation is disgusting. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Listen-- exactly. &gt;&gt; ROB: The men are talking. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm a man. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is man talk. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You know what I'm saying? You would? I can definitely do porn. probably do porn. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I know I could. What would be my name? What would be my porn name? Lefty Lamar, something like that. Because I would throw the on you with my left hand... when I'm done with you. Ha-ha...! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is what happens when you get married in 30 days-- you find out the most bizarre things about your spouse. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at how many choices there are, Kourtney. I mean, I would pick purple, but of course you're gonna do exactly what I say is the opposite. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then I like those twisty things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We could put one of those, also, in your guest room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't want to decorate my guest room, because what if we need it for a nursery? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A nursery? Don't you think you should get married before you have another baby, Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, what are these? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you ignoring me? not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, I said shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mason was an amazing surprise, but now that she wants to have another baby with Scott, I think it's really time to buckle down, get married and do it the traditional way. I just think it's the order of things; it's more natural that way. I'm gonna be in a wheelchair before the day I see that you guys get married, and that's gonna kill me. 54 00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,672 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good, then you can wheel down the aisle. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Hello. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. How's it going? &gt;&gt; ERICA: It's going well. How about yourself? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh... can't really complain. &gt;&gt; ERICA: That's great. Even though typically you're here with Kourtney as a couple, sometimes it's nice to just have some time... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah, sometimes I got to talk about her... &gt;&gt; ERICA: For yourself and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, I mean, nothing's perfect. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mason's still sleeping in bed, so... I'm sleeping in the guest room quite often, still. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Which, you know, isn't the ideal situation, but... &gt;&gt; ERICA: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think Kourtney wants to have another baby. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Kourtney wants to have another baby? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; ERICA: And does Scott want to have another baby? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's a little scary. &gt;&gt; ERICA: It's a little scary... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, to have a couple of kids running around. I already feel like a lot of times it's just her and the baby, and then there's me. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, you know, sometimes I'm jealous. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: When I pictured my life, I always imagined being married, then having kids, and being kind of traditional, and my life is completely different than I expected it to be. And, you know, things are going well and I don't really want to rock the boat, but it is definitely something I think about. All righty, well, thanks for seeing me. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Okay. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Good to see you. you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Maybe I'll see you back in New York. 87 00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,216 &gt;&gt; ERICA: Take care. I'll see you soon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRAD: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRAD: I'm good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mwa! Are you getting excited? &gt;&gt; BRAD: I can't wait. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, right? Pastor Brad is someone that I met when I started going to a church years ago. &gt;&gt; BRAD: It's a joy to welcome each of you to this sacred and joyful occasion as we celebrate the union of Khloe and Lamar. husband and wife. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we've been such good friends ever since that he's actually asked me to go online, get ordained and help officiate at his wedding. She'll come down here. I'm you, she's here, and then the minute the ceremony's over, it's wine and champagne. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; BRAD: It's gonna be great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so, it's my baby mission to get Kourtney and Scott married. &gt;&gt; BRAD: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's time. I mean, don't you think? &gt;&gt; BRAD: Well, they need to do it in the commitment of marriage, sure. You can parent better if you have help, and it looks like things are going really well for them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, they are, they're doing well. &gt;&gt; BRAD: And so it's a nice time for them to take an important step. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Thank you. See you later. Love you. &gt;&gt; BRAD: I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're getting married! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are those glasses? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you going skiing? Look at Mom's glasses. Like, is she going snowboarding? &gt;&gt; KIM: You should actually remove the lenses and make them your reading glasses. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys can make fun of me all you want... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Those are what I call... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...sexual... &gt;&gt; KIM: Chic little devil. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...vanilla. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was talking to Pastor Brad because we were in rehearsals, and he said that he really agrees with me and sides with me on the stuff we talked about the other day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: About what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: About having another baby and not even being married. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, Mom, that's not up for discussion, nor do I care what anyone's thoughts are. &gt;&gt; KIM: So now you like Scott and you want her to get married? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. When Mason was born, Scott was more of, like, a hot mess. But now Scott's really turned his life around and he's been amazing, and he's such a great partner to Kourtney. So I really don't know what Kourtney's reservations are. Why is she holding back? Why is she being so stubborn? life. I don't need a piece of paper to make it a family unit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you ever wonder that God wants you to be married and there's an order to things? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to get married right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't understand where Kourtney's coming from. I mean, I actually agree with my mom on this one. I think Kourtney really should get married. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm fine. But I thank you for your concern. I definitely don't want to get married just for the sake of getting married. I don't need to listen to my mom, I don't need to listen to Pastor Brad or anyone else. Maybe I'll get married one day; maybe I'll never get married. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna go home and plan this wedding. You guys better be there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Those glasses are like barf on a stick. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, sinful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? I'm in here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I stopped and got you some... chicken noodle soup. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're so nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. I just left Mom. She's becoming an ordained p... pastor. It's the stupidest... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can she still have sex? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's... You know, I didn't ask her that question. Okay, here we go. Are you ready? I'm gonna feed it to you. Oops. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, take your... take your soup, come on. Good girl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, but after she gets ordained and marries Karen and Brad, she mentions that maybe she'll marry... Scott and Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you kidding, or being serious? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, I'm just telling you what she said. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does Kourtney want to get married? 'Cause I've never heard Kourtney say that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. But you know Mom and her meddling. Honestly, I'm concerned if she'll even be able to perform a ceremony and get all the words right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause she'll be drunk? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I'm sure she'll have a couple of glasses of wine before she does this. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Be delirious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't talk about this anymore. Thank you so much. You are an angel. I would kiss you, but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And Mom is a high 182 00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:57,243 priest. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ha, ha, ha, ha. &gt;&gt; LISA: What's going on? You look so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. Well, you know, we're doing this wedding here tomorrow. &gt;&gt; LISA: I love what you did. I can't even believe these colors. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't it great? &gt;&gt; LISA: Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did I tell you that Scott and Kourtney are trying to have another baby? &gt;&gt; LISA: She's trying to have more with him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, if you're gonna plan on having more kids, maybe it might be a good idea, I don't know, call me crazy, that they get married. What's wrong with that? I mean, am I crazy that that's what I want for my child? &gt;&gt; LISA: I am totally on your side. I mean, I would die if it was my daughter. She always was such a good kid. She was always, like, so... perfect, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is actually really embarrassing. I mean, here's one of my best friends telling me that she would be mortified? &gt;&gt; LISA: Does she want to spend the rest of her life with him, or is he just giving her these wonderful babies and then they'll be hers forever, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They sleep in separate bedrooms. &gt;&gt; LISA: Well, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, it's kind of interesting. &gt;&gt; LISA: That right there is not tradition anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So it's up to me. I have to somehow... be okay with that. And it's hard for me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kourtney, look how tall we are! You're so short! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you touch the ceiling and I'll kill you. It was just painted. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop. Kylie, don't turn me around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't that great? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Your hair's wet, so now my butt is wet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott, will you and Kourtney be the bride and the groom? I have to practice my vows for tomorrow. You guys can just stand there so I can have somebody to play to. Kylie, I need you here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, hello! &gt;&gt; KRIS: And, Kendall, I need you right here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're the best man. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, bro. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim! I need a witness! God is love, and you two should really be married. I now pronounce you husband... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What a freak! 227 00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:59,165 &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and wife. You may kiss your bride. Do you know how happy it would make your family if you just, like, made it legal? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why is it so important to you if I get married or not? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it's just you're going against every single thing that I believe in. You grow up and you get married and you have babies; a tradition. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay,your tradition. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, I'm happy, Mason's happy, Scott's happy... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't see what the problem is, why you don't want to get married. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll do it when I want to do it, in my time. I've never even said that I'm for sure having a baby, trying to have a baby. My mom takes one little bit of information and just blows it out of proportion. You need to stop butting into my business. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I... No, I don't. I'm your mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, you do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I don't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to butt out if you want to be in our lives. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not going anywhere. I'm your mother. Okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so, then, shut theup... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and get used to it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's no reason to say "shut theup." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why does it matter? Like, if we want to get married, we'll get married when we want to. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I totally get where Mom's coming from, to be honest. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But she will not stop butting into my business. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, yeah, if you've gone this far without, like, being married and whatever, like, she should maybe back off, but my traditions and beliefs match up to hers. I know Kourtney doesn't want to hear it, but if she wants to have more babies, I really think that she should get married. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you're siding with Mom, all everyone wants us to do... &gt;&gt; KIM: I have my own beliefs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whatever! All anyone cares about is that we get married. Can we go? I just don't want to be here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If you want to drive your kids away, keep meddling in what they're doing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're supposed to be on myside. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No! &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't get mad, but why don't you want to get married? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just... feel 271 00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:45,271 like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott's not the one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, seriously, can you even believe my mom? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't even really know what was going on there in the first place. I don't understand that she all of a sudden is a pastor, she all of a sudden wants us to get... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, she was ordained and is marrying them. I don't even know why anyone would want her to marry them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Seriously. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We want to get married for our own reasons, if we want to, not 'cause... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't believe your mother even wants us to get married in the first place. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me, neither. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't even think she wanted us to be dating. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. I mean, do you think I'm crazy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, there was definitely a point in my life where I thought getting married was, like, the only thing left to do and we needed to do it. You know, it's funny for once Kris and I seem to be on the same page. You know, I definitely worry... that Kourtney looks at this relationship as something temporary, and I don't know if it means she doesn't ever want to get married, or she doesn't want to ever get married to me. You know, if it's not broke, don't fix it. Like, we'll get married when we want to, on our own time, which may be in a year or in ten years. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How did the rehearsal go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's all good. I just feel really, really bad that it's not Kourtney and Scott getting married. to be married, and she's decided to be the rebel in the family? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're probably married couples. What you're only worried about feel. So if you want to drive your kids away, keep meddling in what they're doing. shouldn't be meddling in their stuff? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you should not be meddling and pushing... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're supposed to be on myside. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're my husband, and you're supposed to side with me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look it, you got two very tough, bullheaded people-- Kourtney and her mother. It's either Kris's way or the highway. She just doesn't know when to stop. And I think as far as Kourtney getting married, it's about time she stopped. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I'm gonna marry Karen and Brad... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go for it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...instead of who I really want to marry, which is Kourtney and Scott. Okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. 319 00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,640 Just don't be a meddler-- leave them alone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, babe. I missed you. Can you believe my mom is, like, a minister? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah, is that... I mean, is there, like, some legitimate way of doing that? Don't you have to, like, study, like, theology in college or something like that? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know, this is, like, an "ordained minister," so technically, your dog can become an ordained minister. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right, see you, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Kay. Bye, babe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Will you come upstairs with me so we could pick out my wedding outfit? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you wearing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna wear this, like, light pink Nina Ricci dress-- it's really cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know why Mom was, like, so annoying yesterday, but if she even starts again, you cannot get involved. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, wait, but, like, you want to get married? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, I just don't want to talk about this right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm not, like, asking you to question you; I just really want to know, like, why are you so opposed to getting married? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just... feel like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott's not the one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, if I felt like Scott's not the one, I would just break up with him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know? I mean, I just feel like Scott's been working on himself, and he's been doing great, but, like, I just, until I really know, that he's, like, 100% good, like, I don't want to put Mason through, like, what we went through with Mom and Dad's divorce. I know how hard that could be on kids. I don't know. Just going through that... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just a lot. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, I'm sorry that I, you know, didn't have your back. I didn't even think that, like, the divorce could have affected you, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, honestly, had the hardest time when my parents were getting a divorce, but I think at some point she should, you know, really deal with those issues. I'm hoping, like, you know, someday that we could figure it out. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, why don't you just tell Mom that, you know, it's just too hard for you with the divorce? Like, that would... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because Mom is crazy, and if she thinks, like, "Oh!" the divorce, like, scarred us, you know, she'll just feel bad and it'll be, like, a whole other thing. I just don't even want to deal with her. So, we could be unwed sisters together forever. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, honey, I'm not gonna 369 00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:36,229 stay unwed forever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All rightie. &gt;&gt; SHARON: She's got all the stuff she's gotta say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sharon? &gt;&gt; SHARON: Yes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that we should really go through this run of show. &gt;&gt; SHARON: I like that idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause I'm feeling so nervous. Today is Pastor Brad and Karen's wedding. As it gets closer and closer, I'm getting more and more nervous. Who is standing here, me and somebody else? &gt;&gt; SHARON: You and the minister and Brad. Okay... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, okay. The other minister is his dad. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Then he does the vows. And now we now pronounce you husband and wife. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, so I think I got it. I'm gonna go upstairs, and I'm gonna study my script. Everybody's showing up for the wedding, and all I could think about is not blowing my lines because I really don't want to screw this up. "Thanks for investing your lives walking through..." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, look at Bruiser in the double-breasted '80s classic. Jump off. Yeah! &gt;&gt; BOTH: Baby, hand hug! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, man, look at you! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Am I okay? Is my... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is my bowtie the right way? I didn't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really don't want to be at this wedding. My mom just better not start with me today. This is about Karen and Brad and not about me and Scott. Why are you being so overly nice? 400 00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:02,615 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's a joyous day for other people. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Brad and Karen are gonna remember this moment for the rest of their lives, and I don't want them to look back on this and think that it was just a big joke because I screwed it up. So I hope I can pull this off. Um... okay, I usually don't cry at the weddings that I actually officiate. Um... "It's a joy to welcome each one of you as we celebrate the union of Karen and Brad. Brad, as you take your ring for Karen, place it on her ring finger." &gt;&gt; BRAD: I, Brad, give you this ring as your husband. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "I, Karen..." &gt;&gt; KAREN: I, Karen, give you this ring as your wife. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "It is..." &gt;&gt; PASTOR: "...our great..." &gt;&gt; BOTH: "...our great privilege to pronounce that from this day forward, you are husband and wife." &gt;&gt; PASTOR: Give me a hug. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Congratulations. Whoo-hoo! Let's have a drink. Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You did a good job. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. I did it. The service was so beautiful. It was a perfect ceremony, and I hope at the end of the day that they're really happy with the job I did. Can I get a glass of champagne? I need alcohol. How do you guys think I did? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, good. This could be a big moneymaker for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, if you two would get married, I would marry you and you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Forget that! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is my mom's problem? She's trying to talk about these personal family issues in front of everyone at the wedding. Kourtney! See? I don't think you really understand. I wanted something better for you. What I think is better. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're a control freak. You're not controlling this. We're not talking about this again. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just as much of a family as someone else is who has a piece of paper. When we feel it's ready for our family, we will do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just that I wanted something better for you. What I think is better. I wanted you to have that happily ever after that I have. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have that. Just not a piece of paper involved, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not the traditional girl that I wanted you to be, and I get that that's not gonna happen now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my... You're a control freak. You're not controlling this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I'm not controlling this, but you know, you just make it really tough because... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, don't even start crying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I am. I am. It upsets me, because everything I ever did my whole life to raise you kids was thinking, "If you raise your kids a certain way, then you're gonna get this result." I just think it's something that God really wants for all of our lives. I don't know what to tell you, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm leaving. We're not talking about this again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's so stubborn, and she really doesn't care about everything that I believe spiritually. I'm washing my hands of this. Hopefully, one day she'll realize she's going against God's will. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom's so annoying. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why? What happened? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's just annoying. Yeah. Keeping Up With the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think we all notice that Bruce can't hear very well lately. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stupid. This is stupid. &gt;&gt; ROB: You honestly want to know the reason why I don't come over here? It's 'cause ofScott. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You got to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know he's scared. 473 00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:14,633 I'm certainly scared. I just want Rob to be okay.
