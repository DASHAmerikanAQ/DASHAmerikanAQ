- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you ever seen a really big guy squirm? Kris and I are now officially boyfriend and girlfriend. I'm back and forth from New York, 'cause Kris plays for the Nets. We just unexpectedly really fell for each other, and things are going really, really good. &gt;&gt; KIM &amp; HUMPHRIES: Thank you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Now I kind of want that right now. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: 'Cause you always want what you can't have. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Is that true? Hold on, so when you first met me, your friend Carla tried to, um, set us up, and, like, word got back that I didn't say yes at first. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it did not. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I felt kind of like I was prey and you were the predator. &gt;&gt; KIM: First of all, you never turned me down. All your friends told me that you called them so fast. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's not true. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, it is. Two of them told me the same exact story. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That is not true. &gt;&gt; KIM: You, like, fell for me so hard because I was, like, "Get away, get away." &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Well, well played. Well played. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is definitely hard to have a long-distance relationship, but if you're committed to each other, you'll make it work. But unfortunately, that doesn't leave me a lot of time to spend with my family. Everyone's kind of off doing our own things. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh... my God. That smells... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Birds throw up and then feed it to their children. This is nothing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, here's French toast with chicken sausage. Now that Lamar's season is over, I love that we're all hanging out and just spending quality time with each other. No practice, no nothing. This is, like, the perfect time to just chill. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You could see your ass through those. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't see my ass. see your ass through those. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you can't. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: A hundred percent. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't see, like, my ass &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you can't! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yes, you can. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need some caffeine so I can clean this house up. Scott and I have moved into a new house. We've been unpacking. It's gonna take literally ten years to even get this house organized. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Obviously, Kourtney is well aware that I was thinking about marriage. You don't want a wedding at all? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right now... I'm pretty happy with the way things are. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For a while I was wanting something that wasn't but I'm on the right track, you know, life is good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Even with all this mess and stuff, at least it's, like, calm and normal. Like, at my mom's house, everything is so hectic. I feel like when I see Kim and Khloe, it's only in a meeting. Look, I want everyone to get together. We're not, like, really hanging out. I've been crazy busy, and we just haven't made time for each other. We used to always do everything together. Things have just changed so much, and I really miss the way that it used to be. Like, we used to have game night, like, once a week. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you want to have game night, have it here. Game night! You tell me when, I'll be here. I'll go buy every game, if you want them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Let's do it this weekend so we can get the house organized. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What kind of games are we gonna play, spin the bottle? I wouldn't mind making out with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that's too boring. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You have some attitude. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? Hi. &gt;&gt; PALM: Hi, Kourtney. I'm Palm. I'm your mom's new assistant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; PALM: Oh, Khloe. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't worry. &gt;&gt; PALM: Your mom's actually on a line right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Brucey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How's my little Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Brucey. It is getting more Zsa Zsa by the second. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kim's here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi... &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe! Oh, my God, wait. The house! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Korky! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're over at my mom's house to go over our schedules, since we haven't seen each other in a while. We all wanted to get together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where's Mase? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's with his dada. &gt;&gt; PALM: Sorry about your mom. She's still on a phone call. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that your boob I see? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! We're not just here to wait on you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm coming, I'm coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're our manager. us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need to tell her she's about to be fired. &gt;&gt; KIM: When you and Lamar have kids, are you naming your kids with "K" names? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna do my boys for sure L's-- London and Luke. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to call dibs on a few "K" names. If I marry Kris... I want... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. Excuse me. When are you marrying Kris all of a sudden? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, what are... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did he propose to you? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE &amp; KOURTNEY: Have you talked about it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, what do you talk about? &gt;&gt; KIM: We are gonna get married one day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, when? &gt;&gt; KIM: And have little babies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Wait. You guys talk about babies and everything? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know you're on the verge of being fired, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: From all three of us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Palm, can you get that, honey? Okay, I just have to get down to a couple things. Saturday, you all have the Sears meeting on the Kardashian Collection. &gt;&gt; PALM: Hi. You have a phone call, line three. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom is, like, all business all the time when we're hanging out with her, and that's not how it should be, and it didn't used to be like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Awesome." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Awesome." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me take this back to him and see what he thinks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Awesome! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Awesome! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was a business call. I'm working hard right now so that I can set everybody up for the rest of their lives. My job is to take care of their future. Okay, ladies? Ladies? Focus. Stop... Ow! Stop it! Stop it! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Child abuse. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Child abuse! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you're not a child. My 1:00 meeting is here. Does anybody have anything else to say? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're fired. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Awesome! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Awesome! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Khloe? A new shoe closet. Khloe, you got to do something about my closet space. Now, you got all the closet space. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? Hey, Kourt, we're in the kitchen. We could put that under the sink, just line them up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like this is good to put lemons... and carry them around. Pee in it. Lemonade. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wonder how much it would take to fill that up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Probably a few days. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Few days? That's, like, two months of urine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know how much you pee? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I never measured it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why the hell is Kim claiming first dibs on all the "K" names? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who knows? Who cares? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if she says, "I'm getting married and I want you and Khloe to be in my wedding"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think I would still not believe it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Every boyfriend she's ever had, I become the closest with them all because I'm the nicer one out of you and I. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Totally. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's the point of going through that whole emotional journey? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so don't be mean and don't be nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just cannot keep doing that, though, 'cause it drives me insane. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe's here. &gt;&gt; OTHERS: Hey! Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Party town! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's game night, and I can't wait to have everyone over so we can just be silly and not talk about business. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where's Kris? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know, some meeting. She sent a gift; she felt bad. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She sent a gift for game night? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here you go. She didn't put a name on it-- maybe it's for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's so rude. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, nice, a candle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, it's purple. I like it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She sent a card. Check out the card. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, it's re-gift! It's not even from her! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No way. her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That woman's nuts. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: "To Kris..." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, it is! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If this was business-related, my mom would be here. I made such an effort. I'm just over her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where in the hell is Kim? I thought she was coming. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean, where am I? I'm in New York. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: New York? We're having this game night, and we were just waiting for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I came on the red-eye last night. Mom booked me on this photo shoot here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah, all of a sudden, now that I'm dating Kris, all of the work is out there. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's late here, I'm gonna go to bed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, are you in bed with Kris? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you're totally there with Kris. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, fine, I'm here with Kris. Who cares? All right, I love you guys, I got to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nobody cares about game night. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who else was coming? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know, I mean, Kendall and Kylie aren't coming, Rob always flakes... My mom's definitely, like, the leader of the family, so if she makes a family event a big deal, then everyone comes, and if she doesn't, no one will come. I am so annoyed. This game night blows. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks. Today, Kourtney, Khloe and myself are meeting at the Four Seasons Hotel to discuss this amazing opportunity. Hey, Khloe, I'm at the meeting, and I'm actually a couple minutes late-- I thought you guys would be here by now. &gt;&gt; HARRIS: Hi, Kris. &gt;&gt; SUZI: Hi, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, bye. How are you? I have promised that Khloe and Kourtney would be attending this meeting, and it's really important that they meet with the girls and kind of get their vibe for what they want to create for the company. Oh, excuse me. This is the girls. Hello? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hello, is Kris Jenner there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is she. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: This is Khloe's new assistant Fiona. I was just calling to let you know that Khloe is going to be a few minutes late to the meeting today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Thank you so much. They'll be here in, like, five minutes. ♫ ♫ Will you guys excuse me for just one second? &gt;&gt; HARRIS: Of course. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So sorry. &gt;&gt; SUZI: No, no. &gt;&gt; HARRIS: No problem. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello, this is Dottie, Kourtney Kardashian's assistant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm Dottie. It's definitely not our personalities to ever ditch a meeting, but we need to do something drastic to show her that we're serious. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What the hell are you girls doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're riding horses and milking cows. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You arethis whole relationship. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Clench your teeth. Clench 'em. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so mad. I am so disappointed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yee-haw! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shut up. I'm done. You choose teaching me a lesson... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A real manager would... &gt;&gt; KRIS: A real manager wouldn't give aabout half the things I do for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why do you still have pictures of me and, like, my ex here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know how I'm supposed to invest emotionally into Kris. We could get rid of these pictures in 2.5 seconds. There. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney? Where are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason's napping. Can you keep it down? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That wasn't funny, with your stupid secretaries... I don't care who's sleeping. You guys are unprofessional, look look bad. Those people waited for you for one hour. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All you care about is money. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's not all I care about-- I care about your future and building something for you guys so that when you're my age you don't have to work this hard. When was the last time you think I've had a day off? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's our point. You don't make family time. We used to have family dinners. That's our point. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How much money is it worth? Life is about memories and experiences. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You choose showing me... teaching me a lesson... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A real manager would... &gt;&gt; KRIS: A real manager wouldn't give aabout half the things I do for you. A real manager would work 9:00 to 5:00 and not go the extra mile, and that's what you guys forget. It'sup. You should have been there, and I'm done trying to go the extra mile. I'll just work 9:00 to 5:00 from now on-- forget the extra mile. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was insane. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She just doesn't get it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What a drama queen. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim? I love that now you watch basketball games when you used to make so much fun of me. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo! Dunk-aroo! We saw your man dunk, we got it, okay. Do you remember that you used to cringe at the sight of a basketball player? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. True. Oh, my God, you, me, Lamar and Kris should totally go to Australia this summer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you think that's a little, like... go out of the country with someone you've never met before, or, like, that you don't know, really? &gt;&gt; KIM: So let's go on a double date or something first. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When? He lives in New York-- like, when are we supposed to do this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you so, like, hesitant? It's kind of hard bringing someone new into the family. It's a process. Kris is so special to me, I want everyone just to, like, love him just like I do. All right, so when are we gonna do this dinner? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: If Khloe met Kris, she would love him. Like, I just don't get why she's being, like, so hardheaded about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to go. Mwah! Hopefully, if you're still with Kris in a couple months, we could double date. &gt;&gt; KIM: That won't be an issue. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall, I need a plate. It's perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at you! Sitting there drinking your wine. You want me to get you some cheese or something? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's been a long day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? What's going on today? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had a meeting set up this morning, and the girls were supposed to be there. They just didn't show up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What was their excuse? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They were teaching me a lesson. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Teaching you a lesson?! You know what they should do? Each one of them spend a day with you. They don't see all the stuff that you do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But they're saying that they never see me, we used to have game night... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, a big game night at Kourtney's the other night. I know she was upset you couldn't go. You know, it's not like the old days when just everybody was hanging out. Maybe it's more about less business, more family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We used to have family dinner once a week. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, let's do that again. And we'll see how many are in town. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Actually, I have control of who's in town. I can make sure that every Sunday night there's a family dinner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you gonna cook? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no. 'Cause I'm too busy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, really, I'm cooking? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hell to the no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're gonna get a chef. 329 00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:26,005 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, cool. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My bedroom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you need help? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. It makes me feel empowered when I... Ow, I just punched myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why do you still have pictures of me and, like, my ex here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause that was only in July. &gt;&gt; KIM: So? Ah, there's another one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When you become very serious, then I'll swap. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would never have a picture of Khloe up and her ex in my house. Like, it's a respect thing. This is so different than any other relationship that I've ever been in, so I don't understand why you're not believing me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so what do you want me to do? I don't know how I'm supposed to invest emotionally into Kris. I don't know how to keep up sometimes. Kim is a relationship girl. And, you know, I have gone through so much with these guys emotionally. Like, I don't think Kim understands how emotional every relationship is for us. With Kris, I just don't want to jump in so quickly. I'll change the picture when I feel like you and Kris are serious. My house is here, we're always here-- if you guys want to come over, that's more than welcome. Come over. &gt;&gt; KIM: And you think I want to come over and see pictures of so comfortable. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're pictures. It's not that big of a deal, I'm sorry. Like,, like, we could get rid of these pictures in 2.5 seconds. There. The pictures are done. Send me new frames and new pictures when you're ready. Where's your daughter? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a family dinner planned for tonight, and you're not gonna ruin it because you guys can't get along. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's just anto me, except for if he wants money. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's not true. Actually, Khloe gives me an allowance. 369 00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,902 &gt;&gt; KIM: Get ajob and don't live off your sister. &gt;&gt; There. The pictures are done. Send me new frames and new pictures when you're ready. &gt;&gt; KIM: You were the one who, like, met Lamar and expected the entire family to just be okay with it in, like, ten days. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The difference between me and you is, is I have never declared I'm in love or ever wanted to get married before. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just think of all people, my sister should be supportive of me and be happy that I'm in a normal, healthy, fun, happy relationship... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're happy, but you can't force... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not trying to force it, I'm done forcing it... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't force it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I-I won't. &gt;&gt; ROB: What is going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nothing. Kim is so annoying, and she threw a major fit. : Oh, my God, you hate Kris, I can't bring Kris over here-- shut up. &gt;&gt; ROB: Did you throw something? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. I threw both of her pictures of her two ex-boyfriends. Aw, Miles. Rest in peace, Miles. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? Hello? : Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God! You're so much like Kim. You just get under my skin. Where is yourdaughter? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's upstairs sulking. Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sulking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sulking. You know, you know your sister very, very well, and she's very, very sensitive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: &gt;&gt; KRIS: We are a family. It is our responsibility to give her the benefit of the doubt and love him no matter what. You're the one who has been bitching at me for weeks about putting family first, so get your ass upstairs, talk to Kim, apologize. I have a family dinner planned for tonight, and you're not gonna ruin it because you guys can't get along. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, they showed up, they showed up. Where are the rest of 'em? I haven't seen you forever. So good to see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, little Kimmy. Scoot over. I don't want to fight with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You want to make peace? Is that why you came? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, I want... I want to make peace. And, you know, I would hate if someone said that to me, you know, when I was dating Lamar. I want you to have, like, what I have. I've never been happier in my entire life, and I want you to have that. I love that you love, like, so hard. Like, I love that. I think that makes you you. You know, I want us to go on a double date-- you, me, Lam-Lam, Krissy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that'll be fun. We are on the same schedule now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now you know what it's like to be... grueling. &gt;&gt; KIM: A basketball wife. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I ain't no basketball wife, honey. He is a reality star husband. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, everybody sit down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where the hell is Mom? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's so good to see all of you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello, family! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God, yeah, let's hear it-- she made it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kids? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's all raise our glasses. This is what I wanted-- her to make this effort, and make it a weekly thing. This is what family's all about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited that you guys are all here tonight. And I want to get away once a week from business and commit to connecting. And that's what tonight's all about, is connecting! &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, especially for Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: What did that mean? &gt;&gt; ROB: Why don't you think about it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; ROB: 'Cause you're a snob and you're too busy for your family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on down there at that end of the table? &gt;&gt; KIM: He's being such a &gt;&gt; ROB: One, I'm joking with you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, Robert, why are you guys fighting? I don't understand. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's just anto me, except for if he wants money. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's not true. Actually, Khloe gives me an allowance. &gt;&gt; KIM: That'spathetic. You're 24 years old. Get ajob and don't live off your sister. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe we should separate you two. Maybe that would be a good idea. We'll separate you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm switching seats 'cause this energy is crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All we wanted to do was have a family dinner. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob is just a loser. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kimmy, I'll take care of you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What I really want... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Another toast, Mom, really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: For real. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For reals? &gt;&gt; KRIS: For reals. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When her eyes start going, like, a little hazy and low... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's the thing, you know? It's like... if you really want to go to that extent, it's like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What extent are we trying to go? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's had too much wine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How many glasses of wine have you had? &gt;&gt; KIM: To family connecting time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When we all get together, we have so much fun. We might have some fights, but, like, that's what makes it fun. That's just us. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, my meeting just got canceled. I have the entire day off tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am gonna go to New York and see Kris. Or do I just stay here? Khloe, what would you do if you were me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do whatever your heart desires.
