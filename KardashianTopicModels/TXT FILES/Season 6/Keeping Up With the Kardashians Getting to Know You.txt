- Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's drinks everywhere. What do you want from me? It's Vegas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I missed you. So how was it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm happy that I was good, and it was easy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I feel so much better. &gt;&gt; ROB: You honestly want to know the reason why I don't come over here? It's 'cause ofScott. Not really, like, part of the family in my eyes. Like, he doesn't like, make an effort. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 20 years of marriage is really a big thing. So, I've been planning something for a long time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're going to Bora Bora, girls! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every single one of my family members is going to be running around in little bikinis. And that's just not what I'm feeling right now. I will be covered up from here to here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom... I'm so excited that Kris is coming on the trip with us. Yeah, we really haven't spent a whole lot of time all at once together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're going to be thrown into getting to know him on an island. This trip will be like the real first time Kris is hanging out with my whole family. As soon as everyone just gets to meet Kris, they'll just love him the way I do, I mean... What's there not to love? &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's just jump in with all of our clothes on. Off here. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't know about up here-- I don't know how deep it is. Baby, give me a hug real quick. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know, jump in! &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow! Don't do that. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow, I'm going to have such a headache. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What is... &gt;&gt; KIM: My earring's gone! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM:Oh, my God, I'm gonna cry. My diamond earring! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hold on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously. It's not funny. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because literally, that's $75,000. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Come on. We'll find it, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're not going to find it in the ocean. Kris, he's so playful and throws me in the water. I land on the side of my head, and I feel my earring is gone. I'm pretty upset. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I just want to run away, because Kris has never seen me cry before, and I'm kind of embarrassed. Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What happened? &gt;&gt; KIM: My diamond earring fell out. I had my diamond earrings in, and one of them came out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. All right. So take this one out. Show me where. Just show me where. &gt;&gt; KIM: In the ocean. I'm not going to find it &gt;&gt; KRIS: But the ocean, it's not that deep right there, honey. The insurance is going to take care of it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, it is, over there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's why we have insurance, honey. Okay, show me where. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I'm just so annoyed. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Don't move. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now just breathe. Everything's going to be fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's wrong with you guys? &gt;&gt; KIM: My diamond earring came off in the ocean, and it's gone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, there's people that are dying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just told her that, it's fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Anyone would be annoyed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: I work really hard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know you do, honey, &gt;&gt; KIM: And I bought these, and this was the most expensive thing I ever bought. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And that's why you bought insurance. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to seem like a spoiled brat for crying over an earring, but I just purchased these earrings, and... I don't know if they're insured yet. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim, oh, my God, we just found the earring. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: Where did you find it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I found it... it was just, it's huge! It was just laying there, sparkling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: There's no back on it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We've lost the back, though, baby, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Thank your sister. We all got in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, tell me where you found it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Why'd you start crying? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES : That's why you have insurance. It's all good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, you know, that's what my mom told me. &gt;&gt; ROB: Did they find it? &gt;&gt; KIM: They found it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We found it. I personally would never own anything that if I lost it, I would be that emotional about. It's a material good. Emotionally, if you couldn't handle losing it, or you can't afford to lose it, you shouldn't own it, you know? It's one of those things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kris! You just upset my daughter by 96 00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,949 throwing her into the water. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What'd she say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's the deal with Kris, like, throwing Kim in the water? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sure he was kidding around with her. We just got on vacation. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I don't really care, I'm just saying. We're here five minutes, and Kim's, like, crying already. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right, you would've thought it'd taken at least a few days. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like I don't really know him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't really worry about it, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tough guy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sorry. If you lost something like that, you would be like, "Oh, my God!" &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Baby, here's the thing. I don't own anything that I can't afford to lose. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I don't like to lose things. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Don't be so materialistic, that it matters, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I feel like you wouldn't have reacted that way if I fell off and broke my leg. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would be hysterical. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, you wouldn't have. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I would have. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at the guys, across on the balcony. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want to eat lunch at 1:00, you jerk-off? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Listen, we're doing our own vacation from here on out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Check it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, we're more than happy to not have to hang out with some big old jerky like yourselves. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I got a bit old jerkyswinging! &gt;&gt; KIM: How funny was Kris throwing me in the water? He's so rough. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For yesterday. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, I feel like I'm learning all these new things about him, like, he's such a kid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's probably because you're spending more time together and not just having phone calls all day from across the country. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, it's just weird when you spend a lot of time together, you learn so much more about a person than you... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I'm still learning things about Scott. And I find new annoying things about him every day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like he grows more annoying by the minute. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The way Kris screams like that, I think in about four years, you won't... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like a dog barking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to pull out your hair. Hey, loser! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you peeing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It feels hot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's like... probably the heater's on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I think you're peeing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bible, I'm not peeing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you were, it's okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh... so... I feel like now is a better time than ever to tell you something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like, I feel like I never really told you, and I... I didn't lie, but I kind of kept some of the truth from you, about that time when I went with all the boys to Vegas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't get out of control. No, no, it's nothing like, crazy, but like... sitting here in Tahiti makes me think, like, I wouldn't mind having a drink or two, 'cause I believe that I'm... in a place that I can have a drink or two responsibly and not get crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you had a drink or two in Vegas? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. And I should have told you before now, and I feel guilty that I didn't. But I'm not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't know how I feel about that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know, but you have to trust that I wouldn't do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But it's hard for me to trust you because of everything that's gone on, and I don't ever want it to get back to that place. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It never will. Trust me on that. That's not the person I am. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I still don't know how I feel about him drinking. I just hope that he hasn't worked this hard and come this far for nothing. And just to go back to the way that he used to be-- that's like my biggest fear. You're the only person that will know if you feel like you're ready. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not-- it's not... I'm not looking to get drunk and out of control anymore. It's nice to be able to... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So what do you want a drink for? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just want to fit in. 179 00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:15,702 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yo, so Kim, she flipped out hard on the, uh, on the earrings when I threw her in. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course she did. &gt;&gt; ROB: Of course she did. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're talking with a materialistic item. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: She gets those tears-- she was really crying, 'cause she gets the, like, ugly tears. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That was legit? I... I thought she was messing with me; I didn't think that was, like, legit. She tried to play it like she was hurt from the fall in the water. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I hear you-- about that. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm like, are you serious? You're right... it's five feet over the edge. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She could've had seven broken bones, and she wouldn't have cried, but that one earring... boom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's why I'm glad I'm spending time with, you know... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My job is to just teach you guys how to survive. Just go with it, and you never do it again. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's okay. So I, I obviously certain things I don't care about, so I'll let her do her thing. But other things, it's like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yellow light. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You know, it's gotta go my way on certain things. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nope. Oh, then you got a problem. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got a big problem, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got a major 207 00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,821 problem. Good luck. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Today's adventure: We're going snubing. They put this helmet on you, and you can actually go underwater in a really cool little area for a long time with all these fish. &gt;&gt; FLORIAN: Hey, guys. So. My name is Florian. We will be dive master with Guillame today. And, uh, this morning it will be, uh, helmet dive. Something like a snuba. Okay? If you want to call your dive master, you use this. It is your shaker. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We know that move real well. &gt;&gt; FLORIAN: We hear this noise. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, it can be heard. &gt;&gt; GUYS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Maybe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who's going first? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Not me. &gt;&gt; FLORIAN: First person? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I will. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll go first. &gt;&gt; ROB: Are you going to come in? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna chill on the boat and go swimming. &gt;&gt; ROB: You are the biggest pussy. I came here to do man activities. Scott's acting like a little girl right now. I don't really know why Scott won't go in the water. This is a family vacation, this is what we're here for. I'm just saying, my little sisters can do it. If you can't, you're a little &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, bro, I'm not trying to compete with who's tough and who's not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know there's been a lot of tension between Scott and Robert, but there's something weird going on right now. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott, you sure? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That looks like the least amount of fun you could have in the water. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. I'm so scared. I am scaredy-scared. &gt;&gt; FLORIAN: Okay, next. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! That was fun. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How cool was that, Kylie? &gt;&gt; ROB: That was pretty cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. It was cool. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can I drive? &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I don't trust you driving. I want to go home. 246 00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:59,766 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm like Captain Ron over here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, there you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, hello there. Pizza? Mason, I want a bite. You guys ate already? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. We've been waiting here for a half hour. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris and I are having lunch with the whole family. I think it's the perfect opportunity for Kris and my mom to kind of bond and spend time together. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yo, let me see that club sandwich real quick. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's pretty good, actually. Hey, Rob, where are you going? &gt;&gt; ROB: My room. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you taking a little tram? &gt;&gt; ROB: Nah, I'm walking. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here, I'll go with you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wait, don't ditch me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe, I got to go. Mom, I really want you and Kris to get to know each other. He wants to talk to you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Have fun with that, buddy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on down here and tell me something about yourself, doll. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're a big boy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was a weird comment, Mom. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Man... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "You're a big boy." &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It was the way she said it, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, it was. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: "You're a big meaty boy." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was so weird. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: "Aren't you?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, Kris, do you like kids? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah, I love kids. I'm just on this vacation to have a good time, get to know everyone, and I'm thinking the whole time, like, am I being set up? Is this, like, an ambush, basically? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you see yourself having kids one day? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: As long as they're as chill as Mason. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you had to paint the perfect picture, how many kids would you have? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No more than three, probably. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Three? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Once they start getting older, it's like, you're taking two cars everywhere, dinner is some big ordeal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I'm gonna take him back to the room to get changed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, you want me to come? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't care what you do. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Don't isolate me here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't isolate? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kris, do you ever see yourself being married for 20 years? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Um... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, buddy, you're peeing all over me! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That pace-- wow. That's unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's my job, as Kim's mom, to find out what's this Kris Humphries all about and how happy he makes Kim. I don't know how many opportunities I'm gonna have to talk to Kris, so this is my chance. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We got to do some fun stuff. Obviously the Jet Skis are here. I'm not big on, like, scuba diving or anything like that. Like, I get in the water, but I don't like to be deep underwater. That's not really my thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No? That's not your thing? Well, you're gonna be in real deep water if you're not nice to my daughter. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Oh, yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You hear me? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We'll see. Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, babe? How was it? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Did you plan that out? &gt;&gt; KIM: Did I plan what out? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: The ambush. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. Did she torture you? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No. We were just talking, you know, getting to know her a little bit. &gt;&gt; KIM: Was she nice at least? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah, she was nice. &gt;&gt; KIM: And normal? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, she was just asking me about kids and marriage. &gt;&gt; KIM: She was? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: She did say that she was, uh, gonna kill me if I wasn't nice to you though. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And she will. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We have a massage in, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are your legs so hairy, but, like, nothing else is? That's so weird. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I used to swim when I was a kid, and, uh, for the big meets, used to shave them. So I think they got hairier 326 00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,981 because I shaved them. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're such a freak. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whee! &gt;&gt; KIM: Here, you want Kris to sit here and I'll sit here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who's cuter than you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you going poochie? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Attention, everybody. It's great to have the family here, celebrating our 20th. I want to thank all of you for changing your schedule around. I know your mom and I certainly appreciate it. It's a big deal for us. 20 years, baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Happy anniversary, baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Happy anniversary. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Happy anniversary, babes. If you get a chance, could I have a menu? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks. &gt;&gt; ROB: He looks like a waiter. Why would they give you a menu? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does not look like a waiter. &gt;&gt; ROB: He's wearing the same exact shirt as the waiters. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want to have a nice, relaxing dinner, you guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm surprised you don't have teardrop tattoos, like your rapping friends. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is exactly why I don't hang around Scott. Like, this guy is really ruining this family trip here. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott, you should leave. Honestly, you're ruining this family vacation. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This reminds me of back in the day when everybody picked on Scott. &gt;&gt; ROB: Shut up, Scott. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shut up, Rob. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, you need to go easy, bro. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're a douche bag. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not around Mason. You're in a public place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it, Rob. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's a kid at the table. &gt;&gt; ROB: So, I don't give a &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I honestly don't know what's gotten into Scott and Rob. We came down here to spend some good quality time, and here they are going back and forth at each other. I mean, it's just ridiculous. Grow up. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're such a &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's it. No, honestly, I'm going. I can't. No, I can't, I can't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is my anniversary, and I'm going back to the room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just shut up, Robert. I mean, I came down here to celebrate 20 years with my wife, and I got to listen to you two douche bags. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know what this kid's problem is. I'm trying to be respectful. We're on family vacation. He needs to relax. There's no reason to act like this in front of the whole family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Grow up, you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris is just having a good time, trying to, like, loosen everyone up. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did that. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I really didn't try to flip you right there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What, me? I look like a tanker? Is that what you just said? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Have you ever been called a tanker before? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, are those... &gt;&gt; KRIS: He just said I look like a tanker. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, he didn't say you look like a tanker, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think, at this point, Kris has... lost touch with reality. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel too 388 00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,789 uncomfortable, and he just called me a tank. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Grow up, you guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your brother-- I don't know what the hell happened to him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I just feel like, since all the drama went down in Miami, like, I don't think he's seen anything to, like, prove that you're any different. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, 'cause I haven't proved enough. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You and Rob just need to, like, forget about the past. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, we don't need to do anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, you guys haven't really talked in, like, over a year, and you should be the bigger person. You're a grown man now with a child, and, you know... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You can't use that excuse for everything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I can. I'm saying, you should be the bigger person. I understand why Rob hasn't talked to Scott in so long. I'm just over it, to be honest. They just need to work it out, 'cause we're a family and Scott's gonna be here; he's Mason's dad. And I think because Rob is so immature, Scott just needs to step in and be the bigger person, so we can move on from this. Hang out with him tomorrow. You guys haven't hung out in 412 00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:30,156 over a year. Like, just hang out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Making omelets, huh? Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, I got you some mango yogurt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, Scott, are you still fighting with Robert? Is that why he's not at breakfast? Are we gonna have to eat with you guys in shifts? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you guys want Rob, I don't mind; he is your son. I'm more than happy to go home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You don't have to go home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're so dramatic. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just saying, it's their anniversary. I'm sure they want their son around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're like our son. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually the tide's been turning. I'm starting to like you more than I'm liking Rob. He's kind of had an attitude lately. Yeah, I'm kind of-- you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, what's this big ship pulling in? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do you have, like, ADD, Mom? "Is that a big ship out there?" Like, you're like, what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just jump from thing to thing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that a yacht? I thought I smelled money. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think there's gonna be a couple ships out there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's, like, a tanker. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What, me? I look like a tanker? Is that what you just said? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The boat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He called me a tanker. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Have you ever been called a tanker before? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He just said I look like a tanker. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, he didn't say you look like a tanker, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think, at this point, Kris has... lost touch with reality. Here's Scott talking about a tanker out in the ocean, and Kris of course, with her ego, thinks he's talking about her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to lay out? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes, I want to lay out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Will you lay out with me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not laying out. Like I'm gonna lay out with my bathing suit? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel too uncomfortable, and he just called me a tank. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, seriously, get over it. You look fab. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's the way she used to wear her hair when I first met her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Slicked back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Slicked back like that. She had, like, the Elvis look. &gt;&gt; KIM: So now she's as fat as Elvis? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now I'm thick like Elvis? &gt;&gt; KIM: In his fattest days. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In the fat suit. Maybe I'll get a white jumpsuit and a belt; that'll be perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you ever done this before? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. You? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Me either. We're in trouble. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get yourself a paddle. All right, you're off. One side, now the other side. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Other side, other side. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Kris. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go, go, go, straight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go away! Robert, help us! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Robert, help us! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Help me, Robert! I can't see! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let the paddle go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Poor thing! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Help me. Kim, talk to your boyfriend. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did that. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I really didn't try to flip you right there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I honest to God promise that I did not try to flip her over. I was just trying to get on the back of it. I think it's ridiculous that they're all upset that their hair gets messed up, their makeup, this and that. And it's like, we're in Bora Bora at a great resort. Let's just have fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? You're so... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What your sister really looks like right here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Just as beautiful. Just as beautiful, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, this is one of the reasons why I love Kris so much. He makes me realize that not everything in life is so serious. I'm always so uptight. 492 00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,893 &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I hate that she wears makeup. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't really know what to make of Kris Humphries. But if she's in love, we all have to be patient and give Kris a chance. &gt;&gt; KIM: He hates makeup. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bro, we're on vacation, I don't want you to be disrespectful to me. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're usually the dick douchebag. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You were married? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You didn't know that? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No. Kim says she was married before, and I'm really kind of shocked. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She was 19. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wow. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. Hi. You know, I spoke to Kourtney. And I've always cared for Rob. You know, it feels like it's the right thing to do to talk to Rob and try to work through whatever the problem is, 'cause at the end of the day, he's still my son's uncle and my girlfriend's brother. Hi. What's going on, Kyls? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, nothing much. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's up? &gt;&gt; ROB: Dude. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is ridiculous, by the way. &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Me and you, and, like, the nonsense of fighting every day. Like, I'll be honest with you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kylie, leave. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you give us, like, two minutes? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bro, we're on vacation. We used to be like best friends. Fighting over absolutely nothing, talkingto one another-- it's, like, not us. I'm sorry, like, for disrespecting you if I did. I don't want you to be disrespectful to me. I want us to have what we used to have. Like a fun relationship where we got along. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, I appreciate you even apologizing, 'cause Scott and apologizing don't really go together. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right, I know, but... &gt;&gt; ROB: You're usually the dick douchebag. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks. I appreciate that. Thanks. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's who you are, but, I mean, we always have fun together when we're, like, drinking and, like, enjoying a vaca.. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; ROB: ...whatever, we go out. out &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's do some karate together and have fun. &gt;&gt; ROB: Dude, that's the I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hit me with the chips. Hello, my friend. Ia Orana. Can we get a round of beers? &gt;&gt; SERVER: Beer? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks, buddy. &gt;&gt; ROB: You don't have to drink just 'cause I'm drinking and you want to like, you know... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not, like, drinking to fit in with you. I'm just... I mean, I can have a couple beers and have fun and chill. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott, I guess, can now drink responsibly. Maybe this is a good idea, maybe it isn't. But we're in Bora Bora. There's no girls here, so we're definitely drinking. Since when? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not like I'm some old washed-up man. A couple months now, like, I'll just have a drink or two. Just nothing like what I used to be like, you know what I mean? I'm the first person to admit, drinking caused a lot of issues for me. I've made a lot of different changes in my life. And as long as we're responsible and we don't get into any trouble, it's not the end of the world. Cheers. Ia Orana. To the past, present and beyond. &gt;&gt; ROB: Look at that girl. Look at her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You should her. Hey, friend, this is like a shot. &gt;&gt; ROB: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where's the rest? There's like no beer in here. &gt;&gt; ROB: He's kidding. Ha, ha. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ia Orana, there's nothing... &gt;&gt; ROB: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bob, you want to go for a ride on that bicycle and you'll sit in the back? Let's get this party started. Honk, honk. &gt;&gt; ROB: I told you, I weigh way more than you. You get in the trunk. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Coming through. &gt;&gt; ROB: Where's the belt? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Honk, honk. Here's your knee, bumper knee. &gt;&gt; ROB: Beep, beep. Sorry, on you left. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, don't. &gt;&gt; ROB: It actually goes in the water. This is designed. 571 00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,867 Here, I'll wash it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You can't leave the bike here, man. Hey, Bob. Bob, you can't just leave a bike in the water. 576 00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,781 Unbelie... Hey, Bob. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom? You ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think I look fat? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, you look fine. Let's go. Come on, let's lay out. You're so ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, I'm not taking off this sarong, and I'm not putting on a bikini. So this is-- what you see is what you get. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, then what's the point of laying out? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. I don't know how to get a tan here. Because everybody is going to see me in a bikini. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's no spray tanners here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look, there's a kayaker right there. It's some random. I'm just going to lie here and read a magazine. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think my mom is being so ridiculous that she doesn't want to lay out. We have our own private dock. No one's going to see her. She's had six kids and looks amazing. I'm not going to let her sit inside and mope around all day, and not enjoy this family vacation. Mom, let's go. We're in Bora Bora. Seriously, you cannot be doing 599 00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:29,601 this. Let's go. &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: Patrick is outside. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right now, Kim and I are going to go meet with a wedding planner. You know, I'm really excited about this ceremony. It's been 20 great years with my wife. This is nice. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow. All right, how is this going to work if we do it here? &gt;&gt; PATRICK: If we do the renewal right here, we'll start with some of the Polynesian symbols. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow. &gt;&gt; PATRICK: And then we'll do the exchange of the rings. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; PATRICK: Then after the rings, the vows. &gt;&gt; KIM: What does everyone wear to, like, a traditional Polynesian wedding? &gt;&gt; PATRICK: A traditional Polynesian wedding, just a sarong. Like the one I'm wearing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is a perfect spot for it. I love it. All right, I thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got the spot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom doesn't know anything, does she? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, she knows absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; KIM: But don't you think we should tell her and you should tell her that there's a ceremony, just because she's been, like, so insecure lately as it is? My mom doesn't really do well with surprises. I think that it's probably better to give my mom an heads-up and let her know that, you know, we're planning this whole thing, just so she can be prepared and be really comfortable. Maybe let's just do with, like, the Polynesian wedding and give her the ring at the ceremony and just like, but tell her that we're going to have a ceremony before. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think she has any Polynesian clothes. Maybe you can go down and see if... &gt;&gt; KIM: Once you tell her, we'll go shopping and we'll get some fab outfits. That's like nothing. I think that's the best plan. 636 00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:02,294 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, I know. I'm in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason, where's Rob? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. Where's Auntie Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's really good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where's Kris? Where's Kris? &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, you can't... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Well, there's two of us. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's not throw him off, maybe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, Kris, with your family vacation, how many brothers and sisters-- what do you got? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Um, two sisters. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is your family biracial? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: The whole family has, like, green eyes, right? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But is your dad-- your dad's Black, and he has green eyes? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: His grandma was white Irish. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So 28 years ago, biracial marriages were kind of taboo, right? Wasn't it...? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I mean... &gt;&gt; KIM: That's what I always said. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Not really in Minnesota, you know. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...wouldn't even speak to me. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You were married? Was she married? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You didn't know that? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You were really married? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She was a teenager. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I never talk about it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim says she was married before, and I'm really kind of shocked. You guys are serious? She was really married? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She was really married. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What else do I not know about her at this point? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, this is really uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: She was a teenager? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A teen... She was 19. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wow. I didn't see that coming. That hit me like a ton of bricks. &gt;&gt; ROB: That she was married? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What else is Kim going to break to me? What else don't I know about her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sir, have there been a lot of shark attacks? &gt;&gt; MAN: It happens sometimes. You know, like, just with the fishermen. Those are stitches, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I thought we were going on a sightseeing expedition. But this is scaring me right now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's definitely nice having a couple beers and relaxing. This is like good old days all over again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you guys been drinking? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't need you giving me an attitude. &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bobbo. Hey, Bob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Bob. Where's your beer? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want to grab me one? You got yourself a cold one already out there? Good for you. you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ever since Scott gave up drinking, he kind of like left me behind. And, you know, I'm glad that him and I are, like, starting to be cool with each other. 'Cause he really is a good dude. &gt;&gt; ROB: The door's open, you idiot. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I know Scott's in there. I can smell the smoke from outside. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Humphie. &gt;&gt; ROB: Got a seat for you, right... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What's up? &gt;&gt; ROB: ...right on the nip. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's it growin'? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's a grower, you know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you got on there, Humph? &gt;&gt; ROB: You got a... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Pour Homme by Givenchy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I thought you had Unbreakable on for a second. &gt;&gt; ROB: Like, don't even, man. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Strong enough for a man, but sensitive enough for a woman? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...for a woman? Of course. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: So, uh... Kim just dropped that on me today. I didn't see that coming, that hit me like a ton of bricks. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What, that she was married to him? &gt;&gt; ROB: Say it... What, you thought you were gonna be the first? Is that what you were thinking? &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim wasn't really married. You can't really call it married. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think she was, actually. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If it's on paper, you are married. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, literally nobody knew about it. It was like, the dude just kind of... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Married her? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What else is Kim gonna, like, break to me? What else don't I know about her? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys ready to go? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: First thing, Kris-- hop in, we're off to the next adventure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce and I and all the kids are gonna go stingray and shark feeding this morning. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sir? Have there been a lot of shark atta... shark attacks? Attacks? &gt;&gt; DRIVER: Not here, no. It happens sometimes, you know, like just with the fishermen. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DRIVER: Or like me, too. 32 stitches here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: He got bit by a shark here. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Told you. &gt;&gt; DRIVER: There's the stitches, you see? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is scaring me right now. I thought we were going on a really fun sightseeing expedition. But now this guy tells me he's almost been eaten by a shark. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, look at that manatee stinging ray thing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, look at... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Look it, they're coming to us, oh, my God! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wait, I'm so confused. &gt;&gt; ROB: Who screams at the... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Why are they coming, then? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh yeah. They know the boat, and they're here for the food. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Stop! Kris... I swear to God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I need to get off of here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Stingray. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Everyone's freaking out. They see these huge stingrays in the water, and Rob is looking over the edge... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Robert! Kris, help him! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's a shark off to your left. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There's a shark right there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: They smell fear. They're all right under him! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think everyone's kind of overreacting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Swim to the back of the boat. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Oh, my God. Stroke for it, Rob. On your leg! &gt;&gt; ROB: Shut up. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's on your leg! &gt;&gt; ROB: Shut up! &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris is just having fun with Rob. He's not doing anything malicious. Obviously, they wouldn't have a tourist attraction to go swim with these sharks if it was dangerous. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I had no idea Rob would be so freaked out over it. You know, if I could take it back, I wouldn't have pushed him in, obviously. There was no sharks when I pushed you in. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you wouldn't help him out, Kris. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Well, I tried to help him out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Could we get a round of beers? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you guys been drinking? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like you're, like, kind of disappointed now. After you're the one that said make amends, and now I did, and now you're like jealous that we hung out all day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I could care less that you hung out all day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, am I not fine? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've got one last big surprise. I really want to renew our vows. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys just don't understand. I just don't feel good about my 779 00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,963 body, I... &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you crying? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob, do you like Kris? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but I wasn't really into that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like with the sharks? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. I get that's his personality and stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's fine to push him, but then help him get out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; ROB: I would expect somebody who's meeting the whole family for the first time to be like a little preppy good boy. I honestly think he's trying to, like, win our family over by like being fun and that's what our family's about. I don't think he's really trying to, like, actually hurt us and, like, be obnoxious. I think we shouldn't be taking it so personal. That's why I don't really care, 'cause that's just who he is. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I could care less. Believe me. I could care less. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that where we came in? Oh, that's where we came in. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That would be a great place for a restaurant. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, honey, you know the reason we came down here, to celebrate our 20th. Brought the whole family, all that stuff, it's great to be here, all the kids are here, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've got one last big surprise. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: For... for us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For us? Oh, boy. What is it, honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I talked to the people here... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I really want to renew our vows after 20 years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think it'd be great that the family's here, everybody's together, we've gathered everybody together, and... we should renew our vows. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, I'm not a "renew-your-vows" kind of a girl. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris, come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not. I'm not the one who wants to renew my vows, or make a big deal out of an anniversary. I just don't want that kind of attention. Can we just go to dinner? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bottom line is, it's already all planned out. I had... I talked to this guy, Patrick, who does weddings here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Patrick? It's not a wedding? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got Kim... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're married. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kim's been helping me with all this stuff. She could take you shopping, get you some, like, Polynesian kind of outfits. Let's get into the spirit of the island! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just fine in my little cover-up and my white hat. I don't need a Polynesian gown. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, the bride should look great at a... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...at a renewal of the vows. I don't like all the attention on me. I just want to have a nice vacation with my husband. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, have a nice vacation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And you guys are making me feel like I have to do this, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: Go relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, well, you guys just are being mean now. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's being so weird. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was a good way to kill five hours. &gt;&gt; ROB: You think Kourt's gonna be mad at you, that you're... having some bro-ments? Au revoir. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You look like the island lady. Like you were born and raised here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You would make a good Polynesian princess. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All you need is your grass skirt, and you'd be ready to go. I don't know about you guys, but, uh, I'm excited about renewing our vows, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know you're excited... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe I should have the girls help us. Kim, are you good at doing vows? &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely not. That's the one thing I'm not good at. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's what I thought. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am not going to write my own vows, 'cause to me, I don't want to stand up there and have anybody watch me do that. I did it once. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's just family. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you've done it twice actually. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, you've done it twice, let's be honest. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so who's counting? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, what did you think when he asked you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What did you think? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I was really excited to come here on vacation. I just wasn't planning on renewing my vows. This is like a drive-by wedding. I have not... I didn't prepare for this. I don't have a dress. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You don't need to. It's not a wedding. We're just renewing our vows. We're in this beautiful tropical place, you know. I mean, go with a tropical outfit, and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not a big deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You kind of sprung this on me at the 11th hour, like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love surprises. Who doesn't like surprises but you? Robert, you being the romantic in the family... &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We should renew our vows after 20 years, right? &gt;&gt; ROB: Of course. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Of course. Thank you. &gt;&gt; ROB: You should do anything that you can to... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And do exactly what I said. &gt;&gt; ROB: ...bring that spark back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Romantic Rob. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And do exactly what I said. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so tired of trying to argue my case. And I feel like nobody gets where I'm coming from. I had six kids. 20 years later, and I don't like the way I look, period. I'll do anything you guys want me to do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: As long we don't take a bunch of pictures, and we show them to everybody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How stupid is that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not put them on your blog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This whole family does nothing but take pictures. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "And look at my mom. Her and Bruce renewed their vows." La-la-la-la-la, for the world to see. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nobody... The world's not going to see it. It's for us. It'll be cute. It'll make the wall. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, but no pictures. In our own house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, yeah, unless you want one, Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, Kim's not getting one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kim could throw one up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You want one? You want one, Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't like photos in my house. &gt;&gt; ROB: I want one for my house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You want one for your house. &gt;&gt; ROB: Or for Lamar. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who doesn't like photos in their house, by the way? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that she's just concerned she's going to look old and fat in the photos. And there is a thing called Photoshop, so she needs to relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See, we all have our thing. You don't like photos in your house, and I don't like vow renewals. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Up, up, up, up, up, up, uppy, uppy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, I like that leopard sarong. I'm really relieved that my mom agreed to the ceremony. I mean, Bruce has tried really hard to plan something special, and this would totally break his heart. Even this one's cool. We get the whole family-- all the bridesmaids can wear the same one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bridesmaids?! Are you out of your mind? Kim, there's not going to be any bridesmaids. &gt;&gt; KIM: All the guys can wear the baby blue. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sure? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're not going to wear baby blue shirts and have bridesmaids. You guys are really making me do something that I really don't feel like doing. The more I'm looking around for something to wear, the more irritated and depressed I'm getting over this whole process, because nothing looks good. I'm not liking the way I feel in anything I put on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, maybe you could do it like this and do, like, a halter. Tie it around your boobs... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, and expose and show my favorite body part? Is that what you want me to do, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Look how fab. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, what about this one? This one is so you. Mom, what about this one? Would you get these flowers if you were me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, like, up here? 934 00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:10,755 Then you can tie it... here? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not into this anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are making me do something that I really don't want to do, and I'm feeling really uncomfortable, and this is embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's so dramatic. Mom, what's wrong? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know-- I just feel really, really bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you crying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I don't really feel good about myself. And I don't... and I don't think you understand, and I just... This isn't something that I, you know, feel comfortable with. I know you're trying to do something really, really nice, and I know you're trying to make Bruce happy and that you want to do something romantic for me, but I just don't feel good about my body. I don't feel good about myself. You guys just don't understand. I just want to have a nice vacation with my husband... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So have a nice vacation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and you guys are making me feel like I have to do this, and I feel awkward, and it's, like, geeky and embarrassing, and I just want to relax. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So go relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, well, you guys just are being mean now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's being so weird. No, she was crying like a dramatic baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, if she's not into it, I don't want to push her. Say, "Thanks for 20 years," and move on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you guys been drinking? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, am I not fine? 965 00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,561 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, hey, hey. What's happening? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Bruce. Nice shorts. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thanks. My wife got them for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, speaking of your wife... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, my wife. Yeah, let's speak on her. &gt;&gt; KIM: We were just talking to her, and she was just, like, thinking that, like, renewing your... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, she was crying like a dramatic baby because she doesn't want to wear the outfit. Then she's like, "This is just dorky. "I just don't want to renew my vows." &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, she just was like, "It's just so not me. Like, I don't want to, like, write all these, like, vows." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe if she just doesn't have to wear the outfit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where is she now? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She stormed off crying. She probably went to the room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, if she's not into it, I don't want to push her. Say, "Thanks for 20 years," and move on. All right, I'm going to... I'll meet you over there. I'm going to talk to Kris. And then, uh, I'll meet you at lunch. 990 00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,611 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good luck, Chuck. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi, babe. Are you feeling down? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just felt... I know it sounds weird to you, but I just felt like having this whole, you know, vow renewal ceremony just put a lot of pressure on me, even though it was subconscious. It was like... I felt like I had to wear the right thing and look a certain way, and I wasn't feeling good about myself to begin with, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. It isn't that I don't love you. I love you more than anything. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just... you know, if I'm going to do something this special, I want to look my best. I want to have pictures that I'll cherish for a lifetime. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want to look back at some, like... 'cause everybody's been calling me thick and whatever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, honey, stop it. Here's the deal. You look wonderful. I don't care about all that stuff. You can wear any outfit you want. Just get your hottest little outfit on, and... and we'll just go have a party. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce has been so sweet, and it's kind of adorable that he made all these plans and brought us all here together that, of course, I'm going to go through with this. I just want to feel good about myself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, well, I mean, you know, I love you, and we can, uh, go back to L.A. We can go back to L.A., and I can help you lose the weight. I know this never works out. I can help you work out. I can do all those types of things and help you. I know you... every time I tried that, it doesn't work, but I can at le... I can try again. Maybe it'll work now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I'll tell you what you can do. If I ever want a nip or a tuck, you can be there to hold my hand. Okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am so excited. Give me a kiss. For our... non-ceremony ceremony. It's going to be good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, good, good. All right. &gt;&gt; ROB: It was so good catching up with you earlier. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, that was fun. &gt;&gt; ROB: That was like the good old days. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like we brought it back old-school quick. &gt;&gt; ROB: You think Kourt's going to be mad at you that you're having some bro-ments? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh... nah, I mean, luckily, we didn't really get, like, out of control. I mean... &gt;&gt; ROB: We did go in the water with a scooter. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was a good way to kill five hours. It's definitely nice having Rob back on my team. You know, having a couple beers and relaxing together and talking-- this is like the good old days all over again. Later, Richie. &gt;&gt; ROB: Later, Steven. Au revoir. See you in the promised land. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What have you been doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got caught up with Rob. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Reminiscing on old times. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you guys been drinking? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like you're, like, kind of disappointed now after you're the one that said, "Make amends," and now that I did, now you're, like, jealous that we hung out all day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I could care less that you... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, am I not fine? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've set the boundaries. He knows what his behavior has to be with me and what's acceptable and what's not, but I cannot live my life controlling him. Okay, I just need don't you to go back to old times. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't need you giving me an attitude, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't need to be worried. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't need to be worried about you being rude to me. &gt;&gt; MASON: More! More! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: More, more, more. Frog? What sound does a frog make? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And you wonder why I go hang out with other people. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Ribbit." What sound does a cat make? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; ROB: I hear all the time "loser this" from my sisters, I'm going to explode. &gt;&gt; KIM: We all think you're bipolar, and you should go to the doctor. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, that's great. I think you're a whore, and you should shut up. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're being an ass &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I want to come to you first... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: ...and ask you... uh, if I can marry Kim.
