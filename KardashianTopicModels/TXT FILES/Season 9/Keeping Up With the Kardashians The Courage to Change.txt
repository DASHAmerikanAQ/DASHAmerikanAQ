- Previously on Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you? Are you at the loft? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Um... I'm going to the east coast. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You and I are technically, like, still married. I think we need to just talk about that whole aspect. Lamar just wants to run from his problems, and I put the pieces back together all on my own. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to stay married to someone that you don't even know where they are? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I don't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come on, Rob! You can do it! &gt;&gt; ROB: I've been the most unhappiest person for about a year and a half. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dinner's ready. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ooh, yeah, so I can get fatter. I'm trying to lose 60 pounds. I just don't want to deal with all this bull &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What happened with your mom? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Her liver shut down, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ever since Scott's mom passed, this is just a reminder that life is short. Hi. 22 00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:51,385 Just 'cause it's... 'cause it's sad. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: Do you want to bring another rack in? &gt;&gt; KIM: This rack is just random stuff that I was gonna pack, so let's put all Kanye's stuff, just... I'll put this in his closet. Kanye starts the whole big "Yeezus" tour. I have never been on a tour before, so this will be a new experience. So we pack up, and then do the clothes go from city to city of where we're at? &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: I'm gonna have everything set up, and then I'm gonna leave Philly to go to New York. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm excited to have North travel and be on a tour with her dad. I think it'll be really cool. I don't really see me wearing these. These are nice undies. We did a-a underwear game at my bridesmaids... it's like a wedding thingy. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what I mean? Like, almost like a veil. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: Uh-huh. A crotch veil. &gt;&gt; KIM: We did this, like, lingerie thing. Um... yeah. Crotch veil. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have a blister on my foot... on the side of the heel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow. Okay, that hurt. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is all for one night? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? That's not mine, that's Khloe's. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's excited. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You could shut that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, did you hear about that ranch we're going to? A little adventure? It's super nice there. There's spa treatments... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Marivaul... Mary-vaul... What is this place? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Miraval is, like, a little retreat and there's just a bunch of different exercises and activities to focus on yourself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Body polish. Oh... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me see some of the treatments. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's been having a hard time dealing with everything with his mom... and his dad isn't in the best health, either, so... Hopefully, Miraval can get Scott to kind of cope with all the stress that he's under. You guys, they have Ayurvedic stuff there. We could do an abhyanga. "White peat enzymes, sea minerals..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Semen? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's semen rolls?! I'll be the donor for that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sea... minerals. As long as I've known Scott, he always likes to joke about his feelings and turn it into something not serious, and even though Scott's still trying to be funny, I know how stressed out he is. Wait, at night you can get a bang trim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the heck did you just say? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this the place where you put the oil up your ass, like you did? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No! I'm not going to that place. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They don't do that here, unfortunately. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't. I got you on that. I'll check your oil any night of the week. &gt;&gt; ROB: How you doing? How's it going? How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Want me to hold your hand while you get your blood drawn? &gt;&gt; ROB: I thought you were doing it with us, but I guess not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I could. &gt;&gt; BORIS: What's going on here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I heard that Rob's getting his thyroid checked. &gt;&gt; BORIS: Let's see what we need to do here. &gt;&gt; ROB: Lately, my mom's constantly hounding me to get blood work drawn, 'cause I'm just at my biggest weight and all that, so... I see that she's concerned, and she's my mom and she doesn't love to see her son this way, but I, personally, need to do it my way. &gt;&gt; BORIS: I noticed a couple pounds heavier than last time... &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm, yeah. &gt;&gt; BORIS: ...so maybe it's worth checking out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; BORIS: Let's take you in the other room. Let's do some blood work. &gt;&gt; ROB: My veins are hard to find, so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, are they doing it? &gt;&gt; ROB: Shh... Let her concentrate. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does it hurt? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm just filming myself. &gt;&gt; BORIS: So your blood work, we'll have it back in a few days... &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; BORIS: Maybe a week at the latest. &gt;&gt; ROB: Cool. Thank you. &gt;&gt; BORIS: All right, man. Nice seeing you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Thank you, thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. Here's the fancy-shmance. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nancy. How are you, Nancy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so Scott and I went to dinner, and it was like, "I have to pee. Like, you've got to hurry." And I was like, literally going to have to pee on the floor. We went down and Scott was like, just laughing, and it was making me laugh, and I started dripping pee on the floor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There was like, four drops, like, on the floor. And Scott was like, "Ew, what is this all over the floor?" And then we went back up, and I had to take a major shower. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, I would die. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, really quick, Kanye is performing in L.A. 29th he has off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are we gonna see him in L.A.? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. Lamajune? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that Lamajune? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Could I tell him one thing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hold on. Kim wants to tell you something, okay? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: His phone is, like, in a bad area. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. Oh, and the phone's cutting out. It's bad service. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He has bad service where he is. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll just hang up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I-I've been needing to get in touch with him! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. I haven't been able to reach him all day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't just hang up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did it show a number? I'm sorry. He'll call back. &gt;&gt; KIM: As much as I love Lamar, it's just so hard to see your sister, you know, live this relationship where... you know, you don't know when she's gonna speak to him next. &gt;&gt; VOICEMAIL: Please leave your message for... &gt;&gt; KIM: I know they had planned to do therapy together and take necessary steps that it would require to fix a relationship, and those steps are not being 145 00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,060 met. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sorry, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's okay. I've just been meaning to reach him for a while, for our meeting tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe has literally given up her life for the past couple of years. I honestly have never seen someone try so hard at something, and it breaks my heart. &gt;&gt; VOICEMAIL: Please leave your message for... &gt;&gt; JOSH: Hey, Kourt, why don't you want Scott's help? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's absolutely not what I thought that I signed up for. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me help you, please? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, no, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: We know it's hard on you. But you've told him, like, come fix this marriage. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I don't think he understands, and that's what's so hard. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: There's nothing more you can do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So what have I been fighting for? &gt;&gt; ADAM: Hello. Welcome to Miraval. I'm Adam, I'm the concierge. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Scott. How are you? &gt;&gt; ADAM: It's a pleasure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; ADAM: We do have 24-hour concierge service, so if you need anything at all, just let me know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wow, this is sick. This is like what I'd like our house to look like, instead of Beetlejuice. My first impression of this place is... it looks beautiful. So why do people come here? To get healthy, or vacation, spa...? &gt;&gt; ADAM: We have people that are going through life transitions. We have people that are just here to relax and enjoy the spa all day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I have been through a lot, to say the least, and I'd like to kind of get my mind off things and kind of reboot and restart my life a little. I'm into this. Yeah. &gt;&gt; ADAM: Give me a call if you need anything at all. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; ADAM: You're very welcome. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This place is the cat's meow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye, Sydney. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: Bye. Don't have too much fun without us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys hold it down. I'm really excited for this trip because I am traveling for Kardashian Kollection. &gt;&gt; MEN: Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: London, Amsterdam, Dubai. I get it's a lot of work, but this has been really exciting and fun. I mean, just to have a distraction is great. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Welcome to Dubai. About time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. I know. I'm so excited to be here, and I cannot wait to come back. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: And how do you think each one of you added something? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The beauty about Kardashian Kollection is that you have three different stylish girls in one collection. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You might not answer this or you might not like this question, but I have to ask it; I'm a journalist. 201 00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,463 How are things between you and Lamar? &gt;&gt; MAN: No, we're just sticking to fashion and beauty questions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't seen Lamar in a month, two months. I haven't seen him in a long time. So it's really awkward when reporters ask me questions about Lamar. I really don't know what's happening. I'm trying to figure everything out, and put together all the pieces. So I don't really even know what response to give. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I just have to 212 00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,492 give it a shot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No worries. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We have to find it. Are we going this way? I'm a bit nervous about the Quantum Leap. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you even know what that means? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No idea. I just feel if I keep yelling, it'll sound cool. Hello. &gt;&gt; JOSH: I'm Josh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. Scott. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; JOSH: Hi, Kourtney. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; JOSH: So, welcome down to the challenge course, y'all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks. &gt;&gt; JOSH: Yeah, I want to get these harnesses on so we'll be nice and safe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oy vey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Quantum Leap is the first activity where we climb up a telephone pole. The whole thing is about communicating and opening up, so I thought that this will help Scott make progress. &gt;&gt; JOSH: Scott, make sure everything's in the right room. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What, my balls? &gt;&gt; JOSH: Yep. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; JOSH: So, we're gonna climb up this pole. This is where communication comes into play. Because we got to make enough room so the other person can join us. Once you're both up standing upright, you're just gonna take a step off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then what? &gt;&gt; JOSH: And then the rope catches you. But you're just gonna take one step off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. What? I want to go second. &gt;&gt; JOSH: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; JOSH: Remember, give him support if he needs it. Perfect. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, this is hectic up here. &gt;&gt; JOSH: You're-You're golden. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nice, Scott. How's that view? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: About the same as my bedroom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on, Buford. &gt;&gt; JOSH: Nice, Kourt, you're doing great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is not made for short people. &gt;&gt; JOSH: Scott, how can you help Kourt out get standing up there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Um, I don't know. Like, I really don't have... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hold that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: One, two, three, I'll help you up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, no. Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The whole thing is about trust, and I just do not trust Scott to help pull me up onto the platform. It's important for me to be in charge. So I feel like I need to do it myself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Any help or no? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll do it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't touch me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying not to, but you got me all twisted up, too. Let me help you, please? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, no, no. &gt;&gt; JOSH: I betcha he can help you in many different ways. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I could totally help you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney's really nervous, and I'm trying to help, and she's not willing to take the help, and it's frustrating. Okay. &gt;&gt; JOSH: You both need to work your way towards the corners of the platform. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If we don't make it, I've always loved you, Fredo. I think we should do a three, two, one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. One, two... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not three, two, one? We're gonna go one, two, three? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go three, two, one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; BOTH: Three, two, one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My God! Why on Earth would anyone do this? This is soup. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wouldn't tell my worst enemy to ever do that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was a good experience, though, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Was it? &gt;&gt; JOSH: And it's just to bring yourself outside your comfort zones. So how do you guys feel you communicated? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I felt like I was trying to do it on my own. &gt;&gt; JOSH: You know how stable that guy was up there? Tap into that a little bit later and think about it and reflect on that and see how you feel about committing into that stepping off into a new comfort zone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Kimmie... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Malika, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Australia is amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: World tour. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah, world tour indeed. Um, I just wanted to call you quickly about the highly disrespectful Lamar video that came out. &gt;&gt; KIM: This video leaked of Lamar and his friend Jamie rapping about Khloe. It just hurts that this guy that swept her off her feet, made her see love a different way, turned out to not be the guy that she married. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Emotionally, it's really getting to her. I didn't see it, 'cause I just refused to after she described it to me. It just sounds disgusting, and I just think it's a slap in her face. &gt;&gt; KIM: Of course it is. As much as Khloe wants to really ignore all the rumors, it's hard to really ignore something that is said out of Lamar's own mouth. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's just getting a little overboard, Kimmie. And I think it's time that all of us just sit down with her and tell her, "Look... you do not have to keep running yourself into this wall." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Like, she just wants to hold on so badly. And no matter what, it'll never get back the way that it was. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, it's true. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, it's too far gone. I understand that Khloe said her vows and she meant everything that she said, but I just think we all need to come together and support her and get her to realize that she's never gonna win this battle. 320 00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,756 At some point, Khloe has to let go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have nothing to say. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She wants a talking circle, but then she doesn't want to talk! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, what does that even mean? Rob's test results, they're a lot worse than I ever expected. 327 00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,174 What scares me is that this is life-threatening. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, yeah, I was just telling him to... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Leave you alone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just said, "Don't talk to me unless you're gonna be accountable for your actions. And you can't, like, lie through this one. It's on videotape. Like, I saw it." &gt;&gt; MALIKA: He doesn't know what to say. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So stupid. So I find out about the rap video. It really hurts, coming from Lamar. I'm so sad that everything's happening the way it's happening, but I don't even know what to say or do. It's, I mean, it's so hard. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: While you're in the stage of getting past some of these things just to be decent and cordial, I don't get why... why Lamar would turn tables and, like, promote that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't tell you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: He's gonna keep calling and keep texting, 345 00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,970 but just maybe ignore him and give yourself some time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. What is that and what does that even mean, like, with the liver? Mm-hmm. Well, is there, like, a test to see if someone's diabetic? Mm-hmm. When I hear Rob's test results, I never thought that Rob, my athlete, might be in trouble physically. Literally, right before my very eyes, things started to turn and go wrong. Hey, I just got the worst phone call about Rob. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, God, what now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just got all those results back of all the blood tests that I had him run. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If he doesn't change his lifestyle right away, he's 360 00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,905 gonna end up diabetic and his organs are gonna shut down. He has to start exercising and eating right, or he's gonna be one really sick boy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, why doesn't he take this seriously? This is, like, really serious. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's overwhelming. He's in... he's in trouble. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like you telling him another thing is just not gonna do anything, but I think if you go in there with a bunch of professionals, he will see how serious it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. I just, I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, hell, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because Scott is going through such an emotional time, I have set up this talking circle activity so he could talk about anything that he needs and not bottle his feelings. Put your phone away. &gt;&gt; TONY: Whoa. Hello, good evening. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; TONY: My name is Tony Redhouse, and I would like to take you into a talking circle ceremony. It's a beautiful way for us to be able to assert ourself, to be able to share from our heart, and also, it is a way of communicating. I want you just to simply say whatever you feel and let it be finished. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, it's hard for me to take in other, uh, concepts of life, but when I see you being extremely passionate for what you believe in, definitely makes me take a-a step back and wish that I could believe in something bigger than myself. This was the first time in my life that I've gone through something probably as hard as I've been going through. I don't really know exactly where to turn because I don't have a huge belief behind me. I think I worry too much about materialistic items, things that probably won't buy me happiness, but I-I feel that if I have them, it'll give me the relief that I wish that I'd have if I had something else to believe in. And that's pretty much it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that was good, and I have nothing to say. &gt;&gt; TONY: Just relax, okay? Share your heart. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... I mean, I'm happy that we came here to spend time away from the kids, which I think is important. We've been doing that lately. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, I've definitely been in positions before where Kourtney wants to do something, and then it turns out she doesn't really do anything once we're there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Give five sentences. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She wants a talking circle, but then she doesn't want to talk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's about as much as you'll get out of me. Okay. Your turn. &gt;&gt; TONY: Okay, all right. Well, I want to thank both of you for taking time to share this ceremony with me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank you so much for coming. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; TONY: Thanks for having me. 413 00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:40,005 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, that was cool. Learn something new every day. &gt;&gt; ROB: I have to see that doctor at 6:30. She called me this morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is most important anyways. Just figuring out about all the results. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So we got the blood results back from Rob's lab tests, and they're a lot worse than I ever expected. I can't let this go to a far worse place. It's time for me to really help Rob out, take a little control, and get him a nutritionist and just some help so that he can get his health back together. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Do we have any results back? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Listen, I don't want to see something horrible happen to you. Your liver is supposed to be between zero and 44. 429 00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,859 &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's 217. Your liver is shutting down. &gt;&gt; ROB: It is a shock to me because at one point, I'm super healthy and I'm 26 years old, but now I'm at my worst, and I got serious health issues and numbers that are just crazy, freaking my whole family out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is life-threatening at this point. You could only sustain this level of being unhealthy for so long. &gt;&gt; ROB: My dad passed away super early, so obviously, like, my sisters, like, could never handle that again with me, and 440 00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,833 I think that's what everybody's very concerned about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This needs to be the priority. Everything else is gonna have to come second-- everything. You just need to not abuse what you have. You need to realize that this is 446 00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,154 bigger than you are, and you need to let people help you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not into it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you into? This whole trip was Kourtney's idea, and I was kind of standoffish about the whole thing, but now the tables have turned. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't really want to film with my shirt off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am not going to sit by and watch Rob give up. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just don't know what to do... : because how fat I am. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's only 7:45. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Holy What do people do out here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks for that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Want a chip? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: After that ceremony, that's what... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, when you came to, you opened up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I didn't know what to say. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. I felt so close to you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shut up. I didn't want to get... I didn't want to get into it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You never got into anything ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know, this talking circle is just not for me, but I'm glad that at least Scott was able to open up and get some things out that he probably needed to. I'm not as... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I poured my heart out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I'm not into it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you into? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not into talking, if I'm not, like, vibing with them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just felt like I wanted to give him the respect that he gave us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, which is rare for you to give respect to anyone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're a beautiful human being. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Rob. Hi. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Mom. You want to sit down? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm good. I can sit here. Or you can sit there. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's fine, you can sit there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll sit there. I think Rob gets tattoos when he's not feeling very good about himself, and he thought if he had his tattoos removed, he would have a whole new beginning. Hi. &gt;&gt; OURIAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good, how are you? Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; OURIAN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, Rob, what in your heart do you want to have removed? &gt;&gt; OURIAN: Whatever you feel most comfortable with, we'll go with that. &gt;&gt; ROB: I always saw pictures of myself, like when we were doing and stuff, I had a full, this full arm, and I had nothing here. And, like, I was very content with that, and then maybe not today, but, like, the little, like, stretch mark things, too, we can... we can do those. &gt;&gt; OURIAN: Yes, stretch marks, we can remove them. So as long as you're losing weight, we can remove the stretch marks. Let's go to the other room and make you even better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is my brother here? In here? 499 00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,639 &gt;&gt; OURIAN: Yeah, he's here. I put a numbing cream on him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Me. &gt;&gt; OURIAN: And me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who's "me"? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; OURIAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's getting numbed up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I come in? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't really want to film with my shirt off. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just me. Hi. &gt;&gt; OURIAN: Can I come in? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; OURIAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's wrong? What's wrong, Rob? Tell me. Don't cry. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob, what's wrong? Are you confused? Tell us. Talk to us. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm sad. I don't even want to sit down because of how fat I am. 516 00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:51,183 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Rob. We love you. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know... I just don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're going to be just fine. Come in! &gt;&gt; OURIAN: How are you feeling? Good? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm okay. &gt;&gt; OURIAN: Any questions or concerns? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm worried about Rob. 524 00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:13,172 I am not going to sit by and watch him give up. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: What do you want to get out of the walk with me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like there's nothing to talk about for me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's always stuff to talk about. I've kind of embraced the whole "getting to know yourself." Kourtney, I don't really think has come out of her shell much at all. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're all sad. We all love Lamar so much. I just hate, as your sister, seeing you stuck in this place. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's something I thought I'd never have to do. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you don't have to go 536 00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:46,705 through it alone. Like, that's why we're here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? Hey. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: I'm Leigh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Scott. Hey. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: Great to meet you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You, too. Where are we headed? &gt;&gt; LEIGH: We're going to go this way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourt always wants me to be vulnerable and tell her what's on my mind, but she needs to open up, too. So I set up this one walk-and-talk, and I feel like, you know, it would be good for us to get some things out there and try to be able to lean on each other more. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: I'll open it up for you guys. What do you want to get out of the walk with me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... I feel like I don't have anything, like, major to talk about. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: What about you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For me, it's tough hearing her not say much. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like there's nothing to talk about for me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's always stuff to talk about. It's really ironic that this whole trip was Kourtney's idea and I was kind of standoffish about the whole thing, but now the tables have turned. I've kind of embraced the whole "getting to know yourself," and Kourtney, I don't really think has come out of her shell much at all. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: Is there truth to what Scott's saying? That you... you don't open up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't. I just... &gt;&gt; LEIGH: Have you always been like that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Pretty much. Even since I was a little girl, I just didn't really talk that much. Like, my mom would say, on Christmas morning, I would come down the stairs and there'd be, like, everything you could ever want, and I would just be like, "Oh, great." &gt;&gt; LEIGH: So it's kind of your personality to be like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. But I feel like, if I really have something to say, like, I'll say it. I'm not, like, keeping it in 'cause I don't want to say something. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: What you just said is the biggest takeaway. You are not just shy. You haven't just kept it in because it's your personality. Somewhere along the way, you learned in your family to just zip it, play it cool. You might even have a hard time accessing your feelings 'cause you don't know what they are because you have shelved them and avoided them for so long. Is that possible? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: So you might not even know how you feel in certain situations. You probably just shut it down. Scott, you disagree? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I mean, the truth is I love her for who she is, and one of the things is she is kind of a blocked-off person, but I wouldn't want to change her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've always known that I haven't been the most open person when it comes to expressing my emotions, but when Scott says it would really mean something to him if I was more open with my feelings, it's 593 00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:30,836 definitely something worth working on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's never really too close to her feelings, where... that she wants to open up and really talk about it and tell you and just basically pour it out there. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: So, how can you be so in love with someone and you love them... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 'Cause she's cute, I guess. 601 00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:49,554 I just think she looks good. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So, should we take a peek and see what's in this fridge? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my gosh. Okay. I would just get rid of this. And I would get rid of... &gt;&gt; ROB: What about those cheeses? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Those need to be gone. You should probably just get rid of this, too. Cheese puffs? &gt;&gt; ROB: What? My health now is at a risk, and obviously I need to be concerned about it. So my nutritionist and trainers are switching up my workout regimens, trying to figure out what's the fastest way to my goal. I need to literally dedicate my entire life to turning things around. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Did he tell you you're in for 45 minutes straight? &gt;&gt; MAN: That's awesome. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You're actually much 619 00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,300 stronger than I think you're giving yourself credit for. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is cute here, though, with all the little lights. If it's too crazy, we can go somewhere not on campus. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, dude, this is, like, nuts. Is this Frik &amp; Froggin? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I went to college at the University of Arizona, and since Miraval is like 40 minutes away from U of A, I wanted to take Scott to my old stomping grounds. &gt;&gt; MAN: I love Todd Kraines! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Todd Kraines. &gt;&gt; MAN: Thank you, Scott Disick! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I love you guys! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just trying to be more able to open up and show him where I used to live for a few years of my life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cheers. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think we've gone on a trip and done this many activities maybe ever. And, like, stuff that we'll remember forever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I definitely never imagined you climbing a totem pole. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. I'm sorry for not accepting your help on the top. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm here for you, babe-- I always tell you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I think it's, like, a trust issue where, like, I don't... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I wish you would rely on me more, and not just call your mom or somebody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like, I got all the answers. Not all of them, but a decent amount, and if I don't, I'll try to help. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Even though I did plan this trip for Scott, I feel better after coming, too, because I didn't realize how much Scott wants me to open up. So, going forward, I'm definitely going to try to talk to him about different things that are going on. This was our section. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This was your? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I fell down those stairs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like, bad? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, just down the whole flight. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's amazing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was on fuego. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This place really brings a whole new spirit out of you. This whole trip's been a great awakening, I guess. We both learned different things about one another. Hopefully we can use these in our day-to-day life and try to get more on the same page as a couple or as a team. All right, shall we? Overall, I couldn't be happier that we ended up going to Arizona. I'd recommend it to anybody. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Bye, Kourt! We love you! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was amazing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm never going to forget this trip. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me, neither. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. So... so, what are we doing here exactly again? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, we want to, like, feel Khloe out and see what her plan is. Let's help, like, guide her to do the right thing. She's just, I think, been carrying this on a little too long. Today Kourtney, Malika and I are going to meet with Khloe to really have a talk with her and make her just face reality a little bit. As much as we all love Lamar so much, it's just not the life that I want my sister to live. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you guys doing here? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just here to help. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys look snazzed. Where are you guys going? &gt;&gt; KIM: We just came from lunch. We're here just to see if you need help with anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, do you want to go sit down over there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For what? For what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just to talk. We're having a powwow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We just need positive vibes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are freaking me out. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: We just wanted to see, you know, like, what was going on with you and where your state of mind was, and we just wanted to be here to, like, support you in this situation, and I know it's hard to move on. I mean, we're all sad. We all love Lamar so much, but I don't know. I just hate, as your sister, seeing you stuck in this place, not making a decision when nothing's changing. I just don't want you to put your life on hold when you have already, for so long. Like, you've done every last thing that a person can do. You know, showing up to therapy sessions. If it's, like, a couple's therapy and only one shows up, you know, there's not much else you can do. You can't keep on going, hoping that the other person's gonna show up. And I think that you feel guilty, like you're giving up if you leave, when we just want you to know you don't... It's not giving up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just... It's hard to just... Like, for me, it's hard to make a decision just alone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's unfair that you're alone in your marriage. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's just easier said than done, I guess. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally, but that's why 710 00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:13,845 we're here, to, like, just to see what we can do to help. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, it's just, like, much harder than I think, like, just to make that decision. It's, like, something I thought I'd never had to do. : It's not fair. It's not fair that, like, this is even something that I think anyone has to go through. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you don't have to go through it alone. Like, that's why we're here. You know, we know it's hard on you. Like, it's the hardest thing, but you've told him, like, "Come fix this marriage." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I don't think he understands, and that's what's so hard. I've said, "Okay, like, do you understand if you keep not showing up to therapy that I'm done? I'm gonna file." The saddest part is that when you do that, and it doesn't even rattle the person when I threaten it, and no one even blinks an eye. &gt;&gt; KIM: So you've given him the warning. You've said that. So I think we're just, like, how much more can a person take? Like, you've taken so much, and you don't deserve this. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You've done all that you can. There's nothing more you can do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Then I wonder, like, so what have I been fighting for? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just would hate to see you waste your life. You're the strongest person I know, but then when it comes to yourself, you're so stuck on: you made these vows, and you want to be true, but he's not trying, you know, and that's so hard to, like, hear. He's choosing this other life over the life you've given him, but that's gonna have to be his bad. He's gonna have to wake up with himself and realize that he gave up everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It just sucks when you've given so much and you realize it still wasn't good enough for someone. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's not personal, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't help but to take it personal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But at least you know you gave everything. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: But you know-- yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like it's so far gone and so, like, irreversible that even if he said he wanted 749 00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:20,138 to work it out now, it's gonna take years to fix what was done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I heard you actually filed today. Could you ever see yourself with him again? &gt;&gt; GUNNAR: Four times. Back towards me. &gt;&gt; GUNNAR: There it is. There it is. &gt;&gt; ROB: I got serious health issues, and obviously, I need to lose a ton of weight. &gt;&gt; GUNNAR: I got you. Stay right there. Doubles, 24. &gt;&gt; ROB: So, I've been, you know, taking my workout regimen seriously. I'm eating healthy, and I'm sticking to my routine, going on my morning runs, working out again at nighttime, so I feel like I'm in a really, really good place. I just have to stick to the plan, and in a few months, I'll be back to where I was the most happiest. &gt;&gt; GUNNAR: You look leaner already. &gt;&gt; ROB: Probably. 767 00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,865 &gt;&gt; GUNNAR: Just now. It's happening. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hope Khloe's okay. She needs us more than ever. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hope Lamar's okay. It's so sad. Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I heard you actually filed today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe made the decision to file for divorce. My heart breaks for Khloe, and it's so hard to sit back and watch my daughter go through this heartbreak. &gt;&gt; KIM: How do you feel? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It sucks. It just sucks. I definitely feel guilty. I have such anxiety. Everyone... It's more like the paparazzi giving me more anxiety. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's because people are digesting this at now, and not living through it like you have for a long time. Nobody knows what you've been going through. All they know is what they read or see or believe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know it was hard to do, and I'm really proud that you did it and that you're taking that step. I mean, you guys... Who knows? You could get it together and start over and rebuild and get back together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could you ever see yourself with him again? I'm curious if you're really done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could ever see yourself with him again? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I don't know. I'm not answering that question. 795 00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:09,741 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm curious if you're really done. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think she's obviously done if she's taken that step, so let's, like, support her decision, 'cause we know it's the right decision. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You will feel guilty for a while, thinking, like, "Is there more that I could've done?" But there's nothing more that you possibly could've done. So you just always have to remind yourself that, and if you can't remember, call us, and I'll remind you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How long do you feel guilty for? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I literally felt guilty for... a year. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, stop. This is torture. I can't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's something that's the hardest thing that you will ever do in your life, and it's something that you'll never forget. Khloe has really been put through hell, and making a decision this big is a very difficult thing to do. I still remember the first time I got divorced like it was yesterday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's definitely It's not a good feeling at all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that Khloe needs to really focus on Khloe right now and finding her joy again and getting her life back together. She had so much love and passion with Lamar, and that's gonna be a hard thing to get over. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Would you marry me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so happy for you guys; I really am. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Thank you. &gt;&gt; PASTOR: Husband and wife. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love and happiness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Lamar, welcome to the family. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Thank you, sir. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's hard for all of us because we were all in love with Lamar. Oh! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo, chill. Yo, get this thing out of here. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Gimme my money! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's okay, man. It's okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Brotherly love. &gt;&gt; ROB: My little boo. I want to kiss you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Give me a kiss. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you like my outfit? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: There's, like, 30,000 people in there, so to hear, "Hey, Lammie..." You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Lammie! As a family, we will always remember moments like this. But I'm over here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, Mom, get over it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. I missed you guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: At this point, we just want to pray for his happiness. I love you so much. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We love him very much, and we wish him the best, but Khloe needs to just get happy. &gt;&gt; Coming soon on Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, you guys, we're all MILFs. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kim, your mom's trying to outdo you. Beautiful Kris. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is your vagina out? That is so embarrassing for your soul. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that mug on your face? Oh, my... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause I had my whole face... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at my laugh. I don't even know what to do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you think about Kendall showing herself on the runway? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kate Moss was showing her boobs at, like, 16 and no one cared. No! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hold your arms out like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, she can't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My shoulders got hurt so bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was on the market for four days. Now I have to make all these decisions by myself. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We are here to help you pack. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not how I want them done! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want you to get depressed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why wouldn't I take my personal photos? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So when you move there, you don't open them there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop forcing me! 875 00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:43,488 I'm not ready to let go of those photos!
