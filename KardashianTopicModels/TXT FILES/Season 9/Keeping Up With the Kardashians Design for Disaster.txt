- &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. The princess and the pea. You're autographing? &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys are so annoying, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Grab it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I have privacy in my room? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me see if you can grab yours. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do I get a signed autograph? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do I get one? &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE AND KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: I've asked you guys to come for weeks to the newsstand 'cause I wanted to go see it for the first time when it came out. Kanye and I shot the cover of Vogue. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, this is wonderful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE (in high-pitched voice): Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: It's such a dream come true to be on the cover of Vogue. But tomorrow, I want to go to the newsstand, like, really early and go get it. Will you guys go with me? It comes out at 5:00 a.m. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have a workout in the morning. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mornings are really full, and I can't come. &gt;&gt; KIM: They could care less, and it actually kind of hurts my feelings. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So... Vogue. I read it on the john. Oh. Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't. No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, get up. Try, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, Kourtney, do it. on her forehead. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll kill you. on her forehead! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What if I gave you a black mole? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aah! &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's a... she's loose. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's loose? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's loose. Oh. &gt;&gt; MARTYN: So, we're coming in. We've got these white walls. We have an amazing light fixture. You look over there. We're stunned by the beauty of that black and white ceiling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. And the mirrored wall. &gt;&gt; MARTYN: And the mirrored wall. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so excited that I finally bought my house and I have a new home. I just wish I could move in tomorrow and just be there and bring my toothbrush and, like, "Yay, I'm here!" But that's not happening any time soon, because there is a lot of work that I have to do to my home before I can move in. &gt;&gt; MARTYN: Then these really great lamps. They were $12,000. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. That's, like, so stupid. I doubt they're $12,000. &gt;&gt; MARTYN: 'Cause they're proper vintage lamps. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who would buy $12,000 lamps? You would? &gt;&gt; MARTYN: Yeah, I would. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You and my mom. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. I have to say, Martyn wants them. &gt;&gt; MARTYN: Each. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. No. &gt;&gt; MARTYN: All right, so we brought you a chair to sit upon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! It's a little hard. &gt;&gt; MARTYN: Oh, just the way you like it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What am I supposed to do? I'm so bad at this. &gt;&gt; MARTYN: You... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not Kourtney at all. It just sucks. I feel like I have so much going on in my life. I don't know what to do about this. It freaks me out. Keep this one. &gt;&gt; MARTYN: I think it's okay, actually. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so we'll keep that. I like keeping something. &gt;&gt; MJ: You look darling. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MJ: Can I hold onto you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. We have an elevator here. &gt;&gt; MJ: I'm so excited. This is so pretty. Oh. Wow. Look at the fireplace out here, though. That is unusual. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's two-sided, too. &gt;&gt; MJ: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My original piano. &gt;&gt; MJ: I know, I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, you need somebody to come tune it, and they... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They said you need to wait at least two months or something before you could tune it. &gt;&gt; MJ: After you move. &gt;&gt; KRIS: After it settles? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because it's also... You should keep it a little cleaner. Like, polish it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh! I can't deal with you. You know a housekeeper, send them over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a really good housekeeper. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the office. &gt;&gt; MJ: I'm not for hire until my back gets better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You okay, Mom? &gt;&gt; MJ: I think so. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the guest room. &gt;&gt; MJ: Is this MJ's room? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, good. This is perfect for me. I don't have to go upstairs or anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. And then there's a bar right outside your room. &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh! Hurray! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You must have been really wild when you were younger. &gt;&gt; MJ: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She was married three times. &gt;&gt; MJ: Yeah, but I married my high school sweetheart, but we were only married for two months, 60 days, so I beat Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's where she gets it. &gt;&gt; MJ: Yeah, seriously. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna use the restroom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: These are all metal windows. &gt;&gt; MJ: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Watch your step. My mom is actually my hero. Many years ago, she overcame breast cancer and colon cancer, and I just admire how she handled herself. But more recently, she's been struggling with some other issues, like her bad back. I won't walk you all the way back there... &gt;&gt; MJ: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...but if you look down there, it's all mountains. It's stunning. &gt;&gt; MJ: Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Very, very interesting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you cut those yourself? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys know I don't have much. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look fine. All I said was, "Did you cut those...?" First of all, Kim has pants exactly like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Let's not talk about that. Don't ever say that again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All I said was, "Did you cut those yourself?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Never say that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm. Oh, they're almost here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll stop. Right now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Let's bring this and sit... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're gonna hide it, and then attack her and just show her how much we love her. Kourt and I-- we want to do something nice for Kim, so we cover blown up, because we want her to know that no matter what, we will always be her number one supporters. Let's hide in the tent. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should we? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And pop out. Oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hide your feet. Ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was a good meeting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What theis wrong with you guys? Are you 12? &gt;&gt; KIM: Guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We love you, we love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A sister sandwich. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe. You guys, stop torturing me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. We love you, Keeks. Kourt and I have a surprise for you. Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Back it on up. Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We made you a surprise. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's cute. Vogue cover if you can't tell. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's really sweet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was really sweet of them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just wanted to say, sorry that we weren't as excited as we could have been, but we are very proud of you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so excited that my sisters finally came around to realize, like, that this is a really big deal. I mean, my first family photo is Vogue? That's major, and I'm proud of it, and I'm glad that they finally agree. I love it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Smile during this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, did you eat tuna? Your hands reek of fish. Or did yousomeone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ♫ Oh! ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I appreciate you helping me pick out some furniture and stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No problem, partner. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's gonna be fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is my specialty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna be my little interior decorator. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yee-haw. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you are. All right, all right, all right. Oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? What? What is that? What is it? Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. Oh, it's touching me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm driving. What is it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a bug of some kind. Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know where it is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is it a spider? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a flying bug. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! What?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was on me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's on my lap. It's on my lap. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. Khloe, what is it? What is it? you, youbug. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, this year's been stressful. I just want to have fun and laugh, and Kourtney makes me laugh every single time I see her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think it's a cricket. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. It flies. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I think crickets fly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank God it's Friday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; MARTYN: Good. What do we think? We've seen some...? You've found some treasures already? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was looking at some chairs. I like... I kind of like these, but I just... &gt;&gt; MARTYN: They're cool, those, actually. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know if they're, like... &gt;&gt; MARTYN: Are they too small, though? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. That's mine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Like, Scott would probably kill me. &gt;&gt; MARTYN: It's-it's unbelievably uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I have hired Martyn to do my house, but hiring one of the best decorators in town could obviously be expensive, so I am gonna help Khloe with her house, because she just spent a lot of money on this new house, and she hasn't really decided what she wants to do yet. Well, my favorite thing to do when I'm shopping is to take pictures of everything that I like, and then I go through it later, weed it through... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like this tabletop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is cool. Should I take a picture for you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then we'll make decisions on exactly what you're still obsessed with. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Those are cool. Oh, there's real birds in here. That is really cool. Actually, I'm getting it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love it. So pretty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, well, I think we're on a roll. We've got you a whole bird garden. These are actually cool, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For what? You just buy a lot of chairs? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know what, Khlo, I have a chair problem. Chairs, to me, are like shoes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't even have anyone over. I am really impressed with how into it Kourt is. We're all over town. She's trying to get discounts here or there. She did a really good job. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Would you like to hold hands? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you so obsessed with holding hands? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Are you looking for a bedroom rug? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know yet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am her interior designer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Th-That's my vision. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am having so much fun helping Khloe with this project. I have such an obsession with interior design, and this is the perfect project for me to get my feet wet. I can help your dreams come to life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Thank you. I like living dreams. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MJ: I talked to Rob today. &gt;&gt; KIM: You did? He's been doing better, I think. &gt;&gt; MJ: Good. He said he's going to the gym every day. He kind of threw that in there. I didn't ask him. &gt;&gt; KIM: You need to gain weight, he needs to lose weight. &gt;&gt; MJ: That's true. Interesting. &gt;&gt; KIM: So what do you have to do to not get, like... &gt;&gt; MJ: Osteo? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...osteoporosis? &gt;&gt; MJ: Well, see, since cancer, I couldn't take any more estrogen. And I have scoliosis. And there's a lot of things contributing to osteoporosis is the main thing. So keep doing your workouts. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you lift, like, one-pound weights? &gt;&gt; MJ: No, five. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, that's a lot. &gt;&gt; MJ: Do 'em like this, you know. And like that. No, I've been doing those for years. I actually have a muscle there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, you do. Shocked. &gt;&gt; MJ: I know. I have a little... a little pec there. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Here. &gt;&gt; MJ: That door's so heavy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. How are you? Mwah. Good to see you. &gt;&gt; MJ: Kim, did you see what my wallpaper was? It's been this way for months. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I made her face. She sat there very patiently while I painted the cheeks and the eyelashes. &gt;&gt; MJ: Those are good memories. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. You look good, Mom. &gt;&gt; MJ: Thank you. I've been working with pain management. They call me every day. "Well, what's-what's working? Is this working? How much better? What percentage do you think the epidural helped you and do you want to have another one before May?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. I hate it when my mom tells me that she's in a lot of pain, and I constantly worry about her. I feel like you have lost a lot of weight. Do you have an appetite? &gt;&gt; MJ: I haven't had one lately. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so unsettling. I feel like I really need to do something about this because it just breaks my heart that she's hurting, because no daughter wants to see her mom in pain. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is this? 25 grand? Take a girl to dinner before you justher up the ass. This is crazy. &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: I know it's not your everyday doctor's office. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have heard about people that have benefited from medical marijuana. I'm not a drug person. I'm really here to ask you about my mom. She's in a lot of pain. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, guys. Long time, no see. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, it's Jenny from the Block. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, there she is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't like my hair like this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just like when it flows. It looks so nice. I don't know. I like what I like. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, should we look at the boards? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This little stool is gonna be covered in this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hi, sister. Oh, you look like a little country girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Then this is the family room, this cowhide rug. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Martyn and his design team always make the most amazing boards to show me what each room will be like, so I've made Khloe one of these boards so she can get as excited as I am. Black and white photograph on one wall... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I swear, you love this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do. And then this little bunch in front of the ottoman. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. Oh, my God, I love this, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For the entry, this concrete table with, like, four of these. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, you're so good at this. Kourt, I am floored. I definitely think Kourtney could do interior design for a living. I think she's great at it. She loves it. Kourt just gets what I like, and I really don't have to say much. She just knows what I'm thinking. I mean, I think our little collabo is working out perfectly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of you. We're gonna make your house the most fabulous house in the neighborhood besides mine. Kourtney Kardashian Interior Design at your services. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: At your service. Not services. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like multiple services. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I could style you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Mm-mm. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: Hi there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: I'm good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm Kris. &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: It's a pleasure meeting you. I'm Dr. Patel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Dr. Patel. This is an amazing facility you have here. &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: I know it's not your everyday doctor's office. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you have your doctor's office right here in this... in this place? &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: Yes, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have heard story after story about people that I know that have benefited from medical marijuana. And this could be something that's beneficial to my mom. Okay. Great. I'm not a drug person. &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm more of a "have a glass of wine or a cocktail" person. &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: Once it removes your pain, you're no longer gonna consider it a drug. You're gonna think of it as a medication. And, you know, I came from a background where I was actually opposed to marijuana, but I started with a few patients that asked me about it and then I saw the most incredible results with them and, uh, I-I didn't want to stop. And before I knew it, I felt like I was doing something horrible by writing a prescription for prescription medications. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: I've changed lives, and I feel like I could never do that with prescription medication. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I'm really here to ask you about my mom. &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's overcome breast cancer and colon cancer. And she doesn't complain, really, but I know she's in a lot of pain. &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: Pain is definitely a really common reason that people come in. It can range from pain, anxiety, insomnia, cancer, HIV. Um, it's a really wide range of conditions that qualify you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wasn't even gonna talk to you about this, but just, now that you've said that, like, I have a really bad neck. It's chronic. Like, every day at 5:00 I want to die. And I've had three epidurals. &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: Okay, so you would qualify. I just have to do a physical exam for the recommendation and review your medical records. Then I... basically, I'll give you the recommendation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm actually so happy to hear that MJ's qualified for medical marijuana. And why wouldn't I get a recommendation for myself? I've been dealing with this neck pain of mine for years. So now I have this recommendation. Where do we go? Like, where would we possibly find a place that sells? &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: There's hundreds of dispensaries in L.A. alone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hundreds? &gt;&gt; DR. PATEL: Yes, there are... there are so many. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. Well, you've been so helpful. I'm getting quite the education. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think the back splashes should be the antique mirror or do you think it should be, like, a white... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I personally don't think it should be antique mirror. &gt;&gt; ROB: Agreed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that's too fancy schmancy. All right, so I made you this handy dandy folder with expense report. Just make sure that you want all of these things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is this? What service fee? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A service fee for my services. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? 25 grand for you to do what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you mean? You think I'm doing this for free? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: $25K? Who are you? Who do you think you are? We all know that's not happening. No, Kourt is sha-dy. Cheap, shady, ruthless. Take a girl to dinner before you justher up the ass. What thewas that about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is such a family deal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean,me up the ass all day but at least get a girl drunk or something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want some champagne? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not right now. Now I feel like you roofied me. This is crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am an expert. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Great, how are you today? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good... It smells so good in here. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It's our, uh, super hit nag champa. You know, that's like the original incense scent that they used in India like 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow. Well, um... I want... I'm looking for... My mom isn't feeling well. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I want to get her some medical marijuana. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, I see. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't sell that here. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: No, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So what is... What is all of this situation here? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So these are basically things that you would use to smoke. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Then I would need that. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so what would you recommend for somebody who's just getting started? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Probably just a regular pipe would be fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you just roll it up in a paper and smoke it? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You can, but, um, people have decided to use pipes because of the carcinogens in the paper that are not as good for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have got my prescription for medical marijuana, but I need to get prepared for all the other stuff that might be necessary. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So basically, the more that you put, the more effect you're gonna get. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So it's like coffee. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have a leopard one? Kind of looks like a little mushroom, it's so cute. This is so much fun. Who knew that getting a medical marijuana recommendation would mean I get to go shopping? What is this little situation? Will our water pipe fit in there? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Possibly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, let's check it out. My mom is crazy for leopard. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It's a little snug, huh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's like the dress I had on last night. So the fact that they have a leopard print bag and all the accessories makes me really happy. Thanks for all your advice. I'll probably be calling you, 'cause I have no idea what I'm doing. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I haven't found anything grand enough, yet, for this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't either. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I'm gonna keep looking. All we have left to take care of is I just need to have my check sent. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The check. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The $25,000? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You must be out of your mind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I cannot believe that Khloe thought that I was going to help her design her house for free. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get over yourself. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So why would you string me along and have me keep working... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not paying this fee. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For my work? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What work? I've done everything with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's called, I spent a lot of time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, I didn't know you were charging a fee-- we didn't discuss that. Why would I hire you for $25,000? I thought this was a fun family activity. Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not gonna show you the rest of my work. No, and enjoy living here with your disgusting, cheesy finishes. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are all in Miami for our Dash store opening. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, I love our jewelry counters. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, watch the Lord, man. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The Lord is going crazy back there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Watch the Lord, man. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because of your back and the way you've been feeling, what if you got some medical marijuana? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, MJ, could you come into the kitchen for a second? &gt;&gt; MJ: You called? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I went to a store and I got some incense for Kylie. &gt;&gt; MJ: Mmm, jasmine. We used to have the little triangles, remember? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; MJ: I used to light 'em around in the '60s-- you don't remember that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you ever do drugs in the '60s, like marijuana? &gt;&gt; MJ: No, I was afraid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; MJ: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know that medical marijuana could be something that's beneficial to my mom. But I'm actually a little nervous, thinking MJ's gonna think I'm nuts for even bringing this up. Would you be afraid to do any kind of... marijuana now? &gt;&gt; KIM: What is she trying to talk you into? Don't let... Don't let her talk you into any... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, let me just tell you-- because of your back and the way you've been feeling and the pain, what if you got some medical marijuana? &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It would make you hungry. &gt;&gt; MJ: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And it might help with your back. &gt;&gt; MJ: I'll be right back. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not condoning that. &gt;&gt; MJ: I wanted to show you something, Kris. Do you know what those are? Gummy bears. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Gummy bears? &gt;&gt; MJ: But these are... the magic gummy bears. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; MJ: My doctor thought it would be a good idea for my appetite and my back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's marijuana in the gummy bears? &gt;&gt; MJ: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My mom is not exactly the smoking type, so leave it to her to find a much more practical way to take medical marijuana. That's amazing. So you already have a prescription? &gt;&gt; MJ: Yes, ma'am. &gt;&gt; GUARD: Move, move, move, move, move, move. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are all in Miami for our Dash store opening that we are so excited about. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, get out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, do you want to go in another car? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This whole situation over interior decorating is now so awkward. Like, come on, why are you being so rude to me? &gt;&gt; KIM: I was like, "You're leaving, too?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I hope she's gonna be reasonable and come to her senses. This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Her eyes are, literally, so cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She is so cute. Those are your eyes, though. I kind of see his in them sometimes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think just the expression-- 'cause the expression is like: &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, God, look, there's Dash. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It looks awesome. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it looks so good. &gt;&gt; CONCIERGE: Hi, welcome to The Villa by Barton G. Right this way. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are staying at the Versace mansion and it is, like, an iconic place in Miami. It used to be Gianni Versace's home. So many of my friends had always talked about the Versace mansion. It's really, really cool. &gt;&gt; CONCIERGE: This is Gianni Versace's bedroom. &gt;&gt; KIM: How romantical. Oh, my God, I cannot wait to do a photo shoot in here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love it. ♫ Da, da-na-na. ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, let the Lord be with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whipped cream and K-Y Jelly and massage oil. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna be all weekend. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is this because I said we have no kids with us? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is this a joke? These beds are ridiculous. Look at this. Look at me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, let's get a huge bed like this at our house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do I make you horny, baby? Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at the ceiling. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, this is so wild. I can finally sleep again. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hi, what's up? Wait, you guys are, like, dressed exactly the same. Is it just us? Where's, uh, Kourtney and Scott? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, it's just us. I don't talk to Kourtney right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: They wanted to do their own thing. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: How was your night sleeping in Gianni Versace's bed, by the way? &gt;&gt; KIM: It was great. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I tell you why me and Kourtney are fighting? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why are you fighting? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt sent me a bill for interior designing my house, and I'm like... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: But that's a joke, obviously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what I said. I go, "I could've hired..." &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She didn't send you a real bill with an... Like, what's her name, like, Kourtney Does Khloe's House? Like, there's no company. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney Does Khloe. Back Door Abby. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that, obviously, she's spending a lot of time and I respect people that work, but that should have been discussed before. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Beforehand, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And she should have done that, like, for her sister. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm pissed, actually. You guys are heating me up. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I think it's kind of crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just the validation that I am right for my feelings right now. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're so right, it's, like, it's scary. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I definitely feel bad that Kourtney and I are arguing over money. I do believe everyone should be paid for their services. But to be just blindsided with a very hefty bill-- that's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I think you should really go tell her to shove that bill up her ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're trying out a new remedy for her back pain. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's her new remedy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what marijuana is? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, I do, and I want thatout of the house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It does look cheesy right now. The curls you're gonna brush out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course we're brushing it out, you dickwad. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This looks nice. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Welcome to The Victor. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank you. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Oh, we should have hung out here today. Let's get a cocktail. Oh, perfect. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Cheers. Spring breakers. Hell, yeah. Party in my pants. Everyone's coming. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do I look like old Kim circa Super Bowl? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, and I love it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's awesome. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause it's the ponytail. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: It snatches your face up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good snatch. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it hurts a little bit. I kind of need an Advil. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you see how many people are outside? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Duh. My room's right here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's crazy. Oh, my God, there's a full tourist van outside. &gt;&gt; STYLIST: Do you ever wash this hair? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Does my hair look cheesy? &gt;&gt; STYLIST: No, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It does look cheesy right now. The curls, you're gonna brush out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course they're brushing it out, you dickwad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Even though Khloe and I are not on the best of terms right now, I have to put aside the drama and just put on a happy face for the sake of our Dash opening. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have a shoved so far up your wad that it makes you this miserable? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I do. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; FANS: Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am so happy with our Dash Miami store. Oh, my God, I love our jewelry counters. The store looks so amazing, so clean, so perfect. This is our grand opening, and we're so excited. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: I love it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, watch the Lord, man! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The Lord is going crazy back there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Watch the Lord, man! &gt;&gt; REPORTER: We need to ask about Dash Kids. What's up with that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We actually-- which I never even told my sisters-- but we started ordering a couple items of little kids things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I already knew this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah, I told you. Like, some ba... little mini bikinis that match and matching cover-ups. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have so many amazing people that came to this event and showed up just to see the store open for the first time. It's a really good feeling just to know that Miami came out to support. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is a lot of excitement. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: People will write me, like, "Why does Scott always call Fat Joe 'Raul'? Does he not know his name is really Fat Joe?" &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to take the pic with the Dash girls? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Where is Khloe? Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Oh, my God. You are freaking me out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Dash girls! &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to thank all of you for coming. We are so excited. This was our first store that we had after our L.A. one. So this... We're so glad that we finally got to move and come to this gorgeous location. It's like a dream for us. Thank you for all your hard work, everyone. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MJ: I see we're having our cocktail. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you never know. So are you hungry? &gt;&gt; MJ: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; MJ: Not really. That's why I guess I need to take my medication. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you take one? Then I'll make you a little snack in case... &gt;&gt; MJ: In case I get very hungry. I think you should do it with me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Mom. I don't know. I just... &gt;&gt; MJ: It's not a bad thing. They've obviously made it medicinally available to people with AIDS and cancer, and it's a good thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not against anybody getting a little pain relief from medical marijuana-- that's the whole point here. So, if it helps my neck pain and she's asking me to do it with her, I'm here to support and I'll do it this one time. Okay. I don't like to drink alone, so I'm sure you don't like to take this alone. &gt;&gt; MJ: That's how I feel. Okay, cheers. ♫ ♫ They're just like gummy bears. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I never thought in a million years that I would be doing this with MJ. So how are you feeling? &gt;&gt; MJ: Um, actually, my back feels better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you feel like you need to use your cane? &gt;&gt; MJ: Not going anywhere. Do you want a muffin? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like the chips and the guac. &gt;&gt; MJ: You want some popcorn? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, Mom, I'm fine. Never heard you talk this much about food in, like, 20 years. &gt;&gt; MJ: How could you resist? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That incense is, like, intense. This is really good popcorn. &gt;&gt; MJ: You're a good cook. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't cook the popcorn. It's not... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You already have chips and dip here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Where did you come from? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That way. Why are you burning incense? They smell horrible. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, MJ's feeling really good right now... &gt;&gt; MJ: And so is she. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...because we're trying out a new remedy for her back pain. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's her new remedy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well... We think it would be a good idea for MJ to, like, try out some MJ. &gt;&gt; MJ: So we did, we did. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what I'm saying? You know what marijuana is? I mean... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, I do and I won't have it in this house. I hate drugs, and to have Kris and her mom treating this like a joke, that really, really upsets me. I want thatout of the house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let the Lord be with you! How are you, people?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is he doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Versace! Versace! Versace! Versace! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is starting to get a little sloppy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, L.D., what were you doing out there? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just pissed and dripped a little pee-pee in my pants. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, MJ's feeling really good right now. &gt;&gt; MJ: And so is she. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We think it would be a good idea for MJ to, like, try out some MJ. You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; MJ: So we did, we did. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what marijuana is? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, I do and I won't have it in this house. &gt;&gt; MJ: Well, you don't have to. It's in here. I should write that down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think you've ever been funnier. &gt;&gt; MJ: I think I'll write that down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mr. Buzzkill is here. I don't know how to stop laughing. As usual, he's not happy with us because we're having way too much fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, here's the deal... Kris, listen to me. Kendall and Kylie aren't here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want that out of the house before they get here. Technically, it is an illegal drug. Sets a terrible example for the kids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you should do a little bit of research on how a little bit of medical marijuana can be very beneficial for somebody that's MJ's age and in a lot of pain. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She can do what she wants. I don't agree. Maybe with MJ, you know, it does increase her appetite and maybe helps her deal with pain, but we have teenagers in our house and this does not set a good example. You can do it on your own and do it in the privacy of your own home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We are. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But don't bring it around here. I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to take guacamole with you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Thank you. &gt;&gt; MJ: He didn't get it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He was such a buzzkill. &gt;&gt; MJ: He has a valid point, I guess. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is that? &gt;&gt; MJ: That we were having more fun than him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce has his issues, and I totally understand that and respect that. But look at MJ. She's feeling really good, and it's been a long time since I've seen her just let loose like this. Oh, Mary Jo. Oh, yeah. Oh, baby. Oh, yeah. Put your arms up. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And she's back. &gt;&gt; MJ: For an hour or two. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dave, you're gonna take the wholething? Wow, Dave, you really are the nightclub entrepreneur. That's a nice little trick. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Let me help you out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, think I'm starting too early. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Dinnertime! I feel like Madonna in here. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Welcome to Il Sole. Can I offer you some wine? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will have some white wine. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you guys getting? Everything sounds so good. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Kim, you want artichoke ravioli? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. Where's Scott? &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Can I get anyone else a drink? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Two separate chilled shots of tequila. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, a bunch. Let's show these fans what time it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so good. &gt;&gt; MAN: He's living it up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So good. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's amazing. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, no. Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let the Lord be with you. How are you, people? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is he doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I thought this is America, people. Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's happening out there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, he's... He can't go far. Don't worry. Hey, L.D., what were you doing out there? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to know about printed Versace shirts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Remember when I wore a Versace shirt? See me in that Versace? You see what it looks like to be rich? Versace, Versace, Versace! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, he's on one tonight! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm fighting with Khloe, and now Scott is starting to get a little sloppy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's my Myain't right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is just exactly what I don't need. I just want to go to bed, get on a plane and get out of Miami. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe don't drink anymore, so you guys can have a good night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Exactly. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: She wants to cuddle in bed and be normal, not like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, totally. &gt;&gt; KIM: When Scott acts like this, he's really unpredictable. I get, every once in a while is fine, but just not to this level, not this hard-core. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just pissed and dripped a little pee-pee in my pants. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I need you, and you disappear for two months-- that's a really selfish, one-way relationship. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe gets a call from Lamar, and I feel bad, because she always tries to do the right thing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, send my Versace, son. You see what it looks like to be rich? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are on a tight leash tonight. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna get in trouble soon, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you're going to get in trouble soon. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You really are. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You should take a break. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I can't deal with you guys fighting tonight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Take a walk, drink some water, take some bread, whatever you got to do... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Challah bread. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...to take it down a notch, do it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm so down a notch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She wants you to take a walk anyway. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Take a walk. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I have to take a walk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know how much it bothers Kourtney when Scott gets out of control like this. I have to step in and be a good sister and try to prevent a really big fight. Scott, come with me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, we gonna do it like we done did it. Hell, yeah, Versace this &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, don't put your that close to mine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yo, myis soft. Kourtney's gonna kill me. I got to sleep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, are you naked? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I give you a hundred grand if you can do that flip. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Let's go, let's go, let's go! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not gonna do it like... Don't... Watch your head! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can do what Scott does. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, he did a little more of a flip. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That-That's what I did? I did not say, "Hello." I said, "Hello!" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's exactly what I did. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah. Try it. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: You got to try it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hercules. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't even know if that's a flip. I think it's like a side tuck and curl. I'm over. Ten minutes is my max in this room. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where's Kourtney? She's gonna kill me. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Oh, my God. Later? &gt;&gt; MJ: How's the hat? &gt;&gt; KIM: Perfect. Really cute. All right, so... &gt;&gt; MJ: So, how do you get in? &gt;&gt; KIM: So these steps-- it's not gonna be this material. They're gonna be long stairs like this. &gt;&gt; MJ: Is it gonna be more Tuscan or more Mediterranean or what? &gt;&gt; KIM: A little bit more modern. &gt;&gt; MJ: More modern. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have wanted to show my grandma my new house, but she's just had this back pain for the last six months. &gt;&gt; MJ: Sorry, I'm a little slow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you need help? &gt;&gt; MJ: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: The fact that my house is like a full construction zone, and she is here touring it with me means everything to me. &gt;&gt; MJ: That's why it looks so big. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is gonna be North's room. &gt;&gt; MJ: Aw, the baby room. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's kind of big. &gt;&gt; MJ: There are views everywhere. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. And across the way, our master bedroom. &gt;&gt; MJ: Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is the balcony, and then, this is gonna be the second kid's room. &gt;&gt; MJ: You mean guest room? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; MJ: Kid's room. &gt;&gt; KIM: Second kid's room. &gt;&gt; MJ: Good. Good. &gt;&gt; KIM: You never know. I feel like by the time we move in, I'll probably be pregnant. So... and we'll make this the nursery and always leave that North's room. &gt;&gt; MJ: So, this is our little baby room for the next one. How cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MJ: You did all this and no bar? &gt;&gt; KIM: We-we had a bar... &gt;&gt; MJ: How could you not have a bar? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I don't drink at all. &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, but I do. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I think you need one. I really wasn't for the medical marijuana, but if it's fully making her feel better, I'm all for it. Voilá-- that's my house. &gt;&gt; MJ: Well, it's fabulous. I love it. It's really beautiful, Kim. But you do have to get a bar going. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everything's very ironic with you. Like, I don't hear from you for months and I call and call and call and then all of a sudden, this is when I hear from you? So, go see your father if he's really dying or you're gonna regret it later. And you're gonna use that as an excuse, too. You will! You use everything for an excuse. Go see your dad so you have peace. And I don't know what else to tell you. Mmm. Another good mind game on your part. But if it make... If that's what's gonna benefit you, go ahead. But then when I need you and you disappear for two months, that's not... like, that's a really... that comment you just made is such a selfish one-way relationship. Like, when you call you... like, you need to speak to me so I can fix a problem. But then if I need you to do anything, I can't find you for months. That's not fair. I'm always there and I always will be there for Lamar. But it's so draining. It's just this emotional roller coaster that I just don't know how healthy it is. access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, if he is dying, you have to get in the mood and you have to, you know, wrap your head around that. There's nothing more I can say. And you can't use that as an excuse and be destructive. Okay. Bye. Three months ago his dad was dying, and then when I called the nurse, they were like, "His dad hasn't been here." And now he says his dad's in the hospital. I just don't know what to believe. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe's still dealing with the situation with Lamar. I know that she needs to move on, and I am just making things worse by fighting with her about this interior design situation. And I just feel bad. Well, I give you props for always being the bigger person. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: About what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Everything. With Lamar and then with Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What'd Scott do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In Miami being a drunk buffoon. Even though you and I were fighting, you still had my back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, duh! What do you think-- 'cause we fight I'm not gonna, like, have your back? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I know. I'm just saying you're always the bigger person. No matter how much Khloe and I are fighting or annoyed with each other, she always tries to do the right thing. She just has a big heart. And I love that about her. Anyways, I would love to still help you with your house. And it's on me. No charge. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hired Martyn already. But I wanted to say sorry, too. For not thinking you were worth your fee. You're worth 15 million times over that, Kourt. I just can't afford to pay you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You get my services for free. I can't really explain what my services exactly are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They are good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a very extensive list coming your way. Free 99. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you think you know about love? And if you were to marry again, would you elope? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Obviously those two are off the table. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't give a ! My mom should have myback! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're having a wedding. I don't know anything that's going on. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to take every responsibility off your plate. I'm going to move out. Jonathan and I are gonna surprise Khloe and her new friend French Montana. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I think this is her car. Yes, she does! &gt;&gt; KIM:That's Lamar! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That is Lamar. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Sorry... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is happening?
