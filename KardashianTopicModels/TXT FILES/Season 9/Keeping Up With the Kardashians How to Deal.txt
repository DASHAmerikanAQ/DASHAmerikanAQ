- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your whole vagina is out. Now... It's not. I see London, I see France. I saw it all. You need to... groom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, '80s style. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What theis an '80s puss? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, so hot right now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think '80s isn't too crazy 'cause they learned what a scissors was. '70s, forget about it. It's hairy from the leg, the inner thigh, straight to the puss. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just so you know, our family, hair doesn't even grow on your inner thigh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But, trust me, if you guys let off on the laser, you guys would have a one-piece that started from your knee to your other knee. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This looks good. Do you want an iced tea? &gt;&gt; KIM: What am I gonna do with Jonathan? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What-what about Jonathan? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just feel bad. He's in town, and I just, like... I'm not in the mood to go out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, why don't you explain to him that you're a new mom and you don't feel like hittin' the town and you guys can sit around and watch old movies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Jonathan is my best friend, and I know he's in town and wants to go see everything and go to all the restaurants he hasn't been to in a while. But I want to spend as much time with my baby as possible, so I just really want to stay home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you watch Doctor Zhivago? Doctor Zhivago. Have you ever seen it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Me, too. Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I could use a good love story right now. Especially with the whole Lamar situation. &gt;&gt; KIM: How is she doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um... you know... not great. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel bad for Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Six months ago, you know, she had a husband and a family and a bond that I thought would be unbreakable. I just need to be her support system right now, good or bad, one way or the other. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, all of us do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every day I-I wake up and I don't know what we're gonna be dealt. I don't know what's gonna happen, and it scares the out of me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Me, too. My heart breaks for Khloe. I feel like she's in such a place where she just is kind of stuck, and I understand now why she's made so many of the choices that she's made. But now that she has endured so much, I want her to just figure out what she's gonna do next. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just really sad to sit back and watch somebody's life implode right before your very eyes. &gt;&gt; MAN: You guys have been instrumental on making the Kardashian Collection so successful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and I are doing a surprise appearance-slash-speaking event for a lot of the heads of all the Sears throughout the United States. Kourtney, what are we gonna say? And right now, since there's so much drama at home and Lamar and I aren't living together, it's actually kind of fun to just get away for the day and be consumed in our work. Should I just go into, like, "This is a really devastating time for me right now, and it's really hard. I'm gonna be all alone, but I'm here." &gt;&gt; BRIAN: No, don't say anything like that. No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She was kidding, Brian. Khloe is really so strong. No matter what is going on, she always steps up to the plate when it comes to work stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought that would guilt them into selling more stuff for us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I totally offered to come do this event myself, but she insisted on coming. Maybe it's just good for her to be busy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "We're so excited to be part of this year's family." 'Cause it's my only family that I have. I don't have one anymore. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Don't trip because there's crazy tape and whatever there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not on camera, so don't worry. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's up? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited you're here. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's going on? You're so blonde. Every time I come back, you're blonder. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. I really like it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, it looks good. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just my style now is gonna be just, like, more about laid-back. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lighter colors, no more black. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Right. So what do you want to do? I'm here for, like, four days. I have, like, so many places I want to eat. And there's, like, all these new clubs to go to. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you, but I'm not going to a club. I hope you have other friends in L.A. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I mean, I do, but I hate everyone, you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: You know the last time I went to a club? For Halloween at LIV. When we were the Batman group. I ordered North's Halloween costume this year. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: And? &gt;&gt; KIM: If you saw it, you would would die. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Amazing? Cutest thing in the entire world? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I got her two. I couldn't decide. Either a lion or a little mermaid with a tail and just a bikini top. And he's gonna flip. He's not into b... like, her in a bikini. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, of c... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. Hi! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at your outfit. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why are you wearing... That's really uncomfortable. You're dressed like Kanye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're like twins. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm not wearing the... &gt;&gt; KRIS:Hi. I miss you so much. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You look good. Have you lost weight? You look very thin. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. A little. I'm just trying. Trying to keep up with her. What were you guys talking about? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Well, I'm just trying to, like, go eat, and Kim, of course, is being uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KIM: He wants to go to, like... talking about the clubs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have been the least social person in life for the last three months. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really am on a mission in my mind, and if I start going to restaurants here and there with Jonathan-- he's, like, the biggest foodie of all time-- he's gonna be like, "You just have to try this dessert." I decided I will never eat Taco Bell again. That does not make me horny. I don't care about any other fast food. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: But...? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't even eat pizza. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hot Dog on a Stick. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I've never had a Hot Do... I don't even know what that is. &gt;&gt; KIM: What?! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I just saw it... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've never had a Hot Dog on a Stick? &gt;&gt; KIM: What?! Jonathan! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We should go out, and we'll get a Hot Dog on a Stick, you and I. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, Mom... Mom... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Do you know where to... you know where to go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, Mom. I feel... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to go to dinner, too; we'll go to Boa. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you. No, I love you, but Jonathan probably has, like, other friends. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? Well, he wants to go out. You're in there, like, playing dress up with North, so what's wrong with me hanging out with him for a minute? He wants to hang out with me. Don't you want to hang out with me? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah. We'll-we'll go get a... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I want to take you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, Kim, you're way too busy. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I mean, we'll go eat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In our matching outfits. Kim is getting pretty comfortable with this mommy thing and loves staying at home, but she cannot stay in this house forever. Bye, Kim! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: See you later. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, no, wait. I swear I'm coming. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I-I just want to hang out in the car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're coming out of the house? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Stop playing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you laying down so the paparazzi wouldn't see you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? Are they coming? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. I can't tell. I think so. Oh, they're coming. What we do when we get to the mall is we'll have Kim lay down and then we'll get out of the car so they'll follow us, maybe, and not her. &gt;&gt; KIM: If they get a shot of me laying down, then I'll be mortified. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, here we are. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Hey, Kris! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is it? Hot Dog on a Stick? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hot Dog on a Stick. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. Okay, so, a regular lemonade... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: A cheese stick and a... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Regular hot dog. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's to go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, babe. ...plotting and Hold on, babe. Hold on. Hey. I'm just in the car with my mom and Jonathan and we went to the mall 'cause he's never had... Jonathan has never had... , hold on. &gt;&gt; EMPLOYEE: One... two hot dogs out, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, thank you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Should we ride the merry-go-round? Come on. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I can't believe you. This is really... I'm pleasantly surprised. &gt;&gt; KRIS:Oh, my God, I want this one. Jonathan. How much fun is this? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is like pole dancing without the dancing. This is so crazy! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I can show you the dancing. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I think we should just, like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo-hoo. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Let me see you work it! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, literally surrounded by the car and they don't know that I'm in here and it's like, "Ugh, hurry." &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Let's go get a drink after this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what we should do? We should go to this little place right over the hill in Malibu where they have wine tasting. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why not? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Is that, like, where they have real wine tasting? Because, like, I always hear about, like, wine country. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not wine country, but... Oh, my God. We could go to Sonoma. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Is that wine country? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, yes, it's wine country. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm from the East Coast-- all we know is the mountains. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, are you in if this weekend we go to Sonoma and do wine tasting? And I have a friend up there who has a vineyard. You will die. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're kidding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna die. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm in. I'm in! Let's do it! &gt;&gt; KRIS:Yay, we're going to Sonoma. &gt;&gt; KIM: And they're, like, literally, like, staring. Like, they just can't see me. How was your meeting? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I didn't know how fun you are. You're, like, ready to do anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: YOLO! &gt;&gt; MAN: Kris! Jonathan, Kris, how's it going? &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Back up! Whoa! Whoa! &gt;&gt; KIM: Do not hand me one thing, Mom. Are you aidiot?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nobody can see in. Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM:I think one of 'em just saw me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Hi. Have a seat. Nice to see you guys. What's happening? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, so, before, I know we've talked about date night... &gt;&gt; ERICA: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and having a, like, once-a-week time... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was waiting in bed for you to come to sleep... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But then, Penelope was up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...and then, Penelope made a little noise. She brought her in her bed, and it's nice being a priority at night. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Well, it sounds more like you're having a feeling, like you were neglected. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like I just need to either move out until she's, like, wants to hang out, or call it what it is-- more of a friendship than anything else. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Well, let's be a little more realistic... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think it's... &gt;&gt; ERICA: ...because to me, when you start saying, "I want to move out," that means, "I'm so neglected, and my feelings are so hurt, there's no room in this family for me." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't need everything else that comes of a relationship if I don't get anything of the good parts of it. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't need the guilt... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are the good parts? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, like, romance, intimacy. Comes to a point where it's, you know, a little obsessive, and then, it's kind of like, I don't know what else you can do. &gt;&gt; ERICA: What I don't want to have happen is for you to feel like you need to live a separate life. So, you need to have some things of your own, whether that's hobbies, or things that help you with your anxiety. We need to find ways to raise your serotonin levels, and the ways to do that the best are through physical activity. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But if I start doing a positive activity, you can't be calling me, because I'm out of the house, and expecting that I'm gonna pick up or be able to answer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would have no need to call you if you're out doing something positive. &gt;&gt; ERICA: So we need to create positive attention, and, to me, it means, for you, Scott-- you have to be really serious about choosing an activity and following through. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Maybe I should, like, take up 1,400 hobbies, and then... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I thought you were gonna do a marathon. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They cancelled. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Let's try this. Let's try the activity part, and see what happens. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, we'll see where it goes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is not my idea. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I don't think it is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I think you'll enjoy me being better, in a better place. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think I will. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, so, we'll get there. &gt;&gt; ERICA: But, the thing is that you have to commit to this, and it has to be for you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're making me cupcakes? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yup. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A true professional. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Who are you calling? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm trying to get in touch with Lamar. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He tweeted a... like, a long thing. Joe did an entire interview. Joe Odom. "She's been talking trash about my son. I don't think she cares about Lamar. She cares about their image and money." Um, I don't take a dime from Lamar. Um, "I wish he never got married to Khloe. She's controlling. All those Kardashian women are." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wow! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People want to point the finger, but we have nothing to do with anything that's going on. If anything, we've been a support system. Like, take me through the mud, but please don't drag my family through it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, road trip! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going to Sonoma! &gt;&gt; MAN: Have you started adding ice cubes to your wine? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; MAN: You're not supposed to do that. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We're like the Clampetts here in Sonoma. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar called and was, like, crying. He was, like, sobbing on the phone. "They never wanted anything from me." He was making me cry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel bad that Khloe's having a bad day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, she was crying all day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And yesterday, she watched old movies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Of what? With Lamar in it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, and she just said he was so, like, happy and loving life, and he was just saying how much he loved Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say hello. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ah! He's so cute! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's go see what Khloe's doing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: When was the last time you talked to Lamar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today. Lamar called and was, like, crying. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Saying what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He said it's like open season. He doesn't want everyone to feel like they could attack us now. He was really sad, and he kept apologizing about today. He was, like, sobbing on the phone. He was making me cry. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And he was, like, "I will kill someone for them! They never wanted anything from me." Like, he says, like, you know, he loves us, and he does, but, like, there's nothing we can do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you look gorgeous. Do you want to go somewhere? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go where? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just want to go to the gym, put some headphones on, and zone theout. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There is the Golden Gate Bridge! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's up? We're on the Golden Gate Bridge. Kris, say hello... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Here we are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Road tr... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Road trip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wait. Don't crash into the wall. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh! Road trip. Where are we going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going to Sonoma. Jonathan and I are on our way to Sonoma. I'm pretty excited. We're gonna be here for a day or two and relax and have some fun. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It is beautiful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How gorgeous is this?! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm so happy we came out here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And it took 45 minutes to get here by plane. : The best part about this day is, Kim thinks we're shopping. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We really pulled a fast one on her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We kind of did. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm the fun in that friendship anyway. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Like, I tell us where to go, I find the hottest restaurants. I keep her hot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You keep her hot. Maybe you'll keep me hot, too. I need some help. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Speaking of the devil. Hi, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, I'm just here with Jonathan, and we're, um, just driving down Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: To go eat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: To go eat. &gt;&gt; KIM: Fun! Oh, my God, you guys should go to, um, Mr. C's. I'm dying to go there. Jonathan, when I'm back, will you come with me? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Of course. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, have a really good day, Kim. We love you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We miss you. I'll see you, uh, probably later, and if I don't come back tonight, uh, like, to your house, I'll see you then tomorrow or something. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, don't forget to come by. I want to hang out. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Of course. Make a right on Rodeo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Hey, Kim, we got to go. Bye. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: So exciting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello, Sonoma. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Cheers. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: To our... to our new friendship. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's to Sonoma and to us. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Here's to Kim never talking to me again. Thank you. I'm really happy we did this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God, there's another story. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Which one now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is the eighth one today. "Khloe, marriage is a workout." What?! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I think we should give 'em something to talk about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're in Sonoma. It's kind of like a drama-free zone, which I like. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, sick! Oh, you... &gt;&gt; MAN: You're going to have to go quarter speed for him. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is pretty serious stuff. I told Kourtney that I was going to start doing more activities, and I was with my therapist, and we were trying to come up with what I could do. And at my age, it's, like, what am I really gonna do? I'm not gonna start playing basketball or football. So, to hold up my end of the therapy assignment, I figured I would seek out a dojo and see if the Lord could do karate. This way, Kourt will be happy I'm doing some new activities. So, I feel like it's a win-win situation. I don't understand. No one actually hits each other. They just, like, make pretend? &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, this is probably just the beginning... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Practice. &gt;&gt; ROB: ...and then they'll get into that. But, and like I say... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's a brown belt. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's too much commitment for me. I'll do one class, and I'll be done. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm pretty sure... I could just make pretend I knew all this stuff. It doesn't look that hard. &gt;&gt; ROB: A hundred percent. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I thought karate would be a good activity, but now that I'm at this dojo, everybody's taking it a little bit more serious than I thought, and it's kind of weirding me out a bit. So I figure I'll just let Kourtney think I'm hitting the dojo here or there. I mean, it's not like she's gonna ask to fight me to see my moves. Ew! That guy sweat on this chair. &gt;&gt; ROYA: You look so cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my goodness, thank you. Ooh. Oh, hello, princess. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So we just wanted to come and get an update on everything and how it's going. &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: I think really well. I feel like I'm getting more of the hang of it. Spending a little bit more time on the floor, too... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: ...and getting to know everyone here. &gt;&gt; ROYA: Letting things sell themselves instead of pushing them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? Are you okay? Lamar... Lamar... I'm sorry you can't be with me right now. Is everything okay? Why are you calling? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm trying to fix what my father said to the media. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what you're trying to do? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, I'm trying. ...if somebody say something about one of my sisters. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, and we appreciate you standing up for us. Thank you. Lamar is so apologetic for, you know, what his father's done, and the things that his father's said about our family. But we know where our love is for one another. We know how much he loves and respects my family. I know those weren't his words. I know that those were his father's words. Oh, Kourtney's here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Lamar. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hey, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Penelope's here, too. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Say hi. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hi. Hi, P. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, well, we love you and we're here for you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just want to do whatever I can, you know? All right, well I'm gonna go, 'cause Penelope is whining. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Okay, and tell Mason to give me my money. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I will. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, we'll talk later, okay? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I love Khloe Kardashian-Odom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, we're getting massages in the same room? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is really uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Jonathan is so crazy. Just don't... : What are you doing? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? Hey, Lamar. You okay? Khloe and Lamar need to just get out of, you know, this funk that they're in, whether they end up together or not. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mase, did you see Mom when she was a little girl? That's Mom and that's Grandpa Robert. Do you remember I told you about him? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you think Bruce is gonna, like, still be these kids' grandparent? &gt;&gt; ROB: Why? What happened? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like, he's, like, lives in Malibu now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know, like, is he still gonna, like, talk to them? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, why would he not? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's not like they're getting a divorce or something. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did I tell you Scott is taking karate? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you taking karate? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just feel like I need, like, some activities outside of the house to relieve some of my stress. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so excited that you actually went. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you been to one of his classes? You should go see. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, she doesn't care. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would come see one of your classes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, but they're pretty far. Like, I'm, like, past Van Nuys, past Burbank, like, it's deep Valley, but it's good-- that's, like, where the best guys are, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, if you want me to come, I would come see it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You should go check it out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, the last thing I wanted was anybody to get in Kourtney's head and make her think she needed to support me through this karate career that I'm not really on. Thanks, Kim, this is gonna be pretty great for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe you'll be his good-luck charm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow, look at this, Jonathan! Wait, we're getting massages in the same room? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is really uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is what you do with somebody you're kind of intimate with, right? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Well, is she gonna be in that tub naked or no? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! Turn around. Jonathan and I have the best day planned. We're gonna get massages, we're gonna go on a biking trip, we're gonna go wine tasting, and just really enjoy the town of Sonoma. Now, that feels good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just... What theare you doing? You just spit all over my face. Why are you massaging me? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Put those lashes down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just don't... What are you doing? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you get a ..., I'll kill myself. Jonathan is so crazy... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm sorry, this is really weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...but a little creepy. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Do not start moaning, please. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This'll feel really weird. No, God, no. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Here we are. &gt;&gt; BEN: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; BEN: Good. Welcome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good to see you. Thanks for having us. This is Jonathan. &gt;&gt; BEN: Jonathan, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Good hair. &gt;&gt; BEN: Hey, right? I could say the same for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I met Ben on the set of when he came on to talk about his winery, Envolve. It's no secret that I love a little wine once in a while. This is so cool. &gt;&gt; BEN: Uh, welcome, by the way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Cheers. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Thank you. See, I already feel, like, the heat going through me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You do? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, instantly. 'Cause I don't drink, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just guzzle wine, 'cause I don't know how to drink it, apparently. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We're like the Clampetts here, in Sonoma. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Gulping wine like beer, let's go into the square. &gt;&gt; BEN: You started adding ice cubes to your wine? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; BEN: You're not supposed to do that. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's very trailer park, right? It's kind of "out of the box" wine? &gt;&gt; BEN: I wouldn't call it trailer park, but... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Well, it's... it's a little low-end. Should we take a seat? Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. All right, Jonathan. &gt;&gt; BEN: He's the official tasting room greeter. Here's my favorite trick. : Rock and roll! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You can take her. I'm leaving her here in Sonoma. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you're not. You cannot get rid of me that fast. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Kim! Give me a photo, over here! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have not eaten at a restaurant in so long. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's been a long time coming. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you excited? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; BLAC: Hey, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know I've been ditched by Jonathan because I'm not social enough, but, you know, I just want to go and eat at a restaurant. I haven't done that in a long time. So I'm excited. Oh, my God, that bread. That bread would do me in when I was pregnant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, what's your diet right now? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: By the way, I ordered the wings-- the wings here are ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm into the wings. &gt;&gt; BLAC: You are gonna like the wings. &gt;&gt; KIM: First meal out, like, excited to eat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is why you can't leave the house. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? Hey, Lamar. You okay? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever have to worry about me saying things that come out of my mouth. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would never think that you ever said anything, and know that no matter what happens... we, our family, would never say anything about you. So just know that. There's so many stories every day. We can take it, we're willing to take some of the blame or the heat for you, because we're all here to help you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No, I get it, I get it, I get that part. &gt;&gt; KIM: So you can always know that, and be confident knowing that no matter what happens, we're always your family and we're always here to support you. Okay? I love you. Call me if you need me. Bye. When Lamar calls me, so upset about his dad's interview, it's heartbreaking, but Khloe and Lamar need to just get out of, you know, this funk that they're in, whether they end up together or not. Lamar just called me. You know his dad made all these statements. So Lamar wrote this and wants to tweet it. "I have to get this out: I have let this man get away with a lot of "He wasn't there to raise me. He was absent all my life due to his own demons. Then came a blessing of a family..." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is, uh, this is already a cutoff on Twitter. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Say what you want about me, but leave the ones who have done nothing but protect and love me out of this. That goes to everyone." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think he needs to be sending out tweets. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. It's nobody's business, man. Twitter, the public, like, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: Lamar just feels so bad. He's, like, "The one pride that I have in life is when I'm with you guys, when I'm standing next to you guys." He just feels like we're a sense of family for him, which it's true. get it all back. be able to forgive him if he tried to get his life in order for her. &gt;&gt; BEN: Cheers, and welcome to Sonoma. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'd like to take the first helicopter out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who brought Jonathan? Would you slap me upside the head the next time I have one of these bright ideas? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Messed up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar came over last night. And he's, like, "I just miss you, I haven't seen you in, like, two months." He's, like, "Can I sleep here tonight?" &gt;&gt; ROB: Just leave it. We don't need to put another mirror in there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't lock the door? This is a rough neighborhood, bro-- it's the Valley. &gt;&gt; ROB: I know, brother. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm locking it. The Lord's here. &gt;&gt; ROB: All righty. Cool. Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I haven't seen the whole place yet. &gt;&gt; ROB: How you doing, man? Wait. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I didn't see the leg tat-- what does it say? &gt;&gt; ROB: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can I take a picture of just the "Lord" part with my face? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. Here, I can do it from... Oh, you want to just push the button? Just don't get in my, you know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like just put it down. Yeah. And I'll just be, like, chilling. I think we got it. Yeah, I appreciate it. Yo, so check me out, I got all Unagi. The gloves... This is just for, like, chopping balsa wood and &gt;&gt; ROB: You should do MMA. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not trying to kill myself-- I have two kids. Out of all the things that Kourtney gets her mind wrapped around is now this karate thing. I got to cram all this information and all these moves into one quick little thing so that I've actually been doing karate. So, let's Google, like, some moves so I, like, at least, like, I know what I'm... &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, you want to put on that DVD? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. Let's get serious. This is... I got to get the "L.D." crest on this bad boy. Yeah! This is perfect. This is for me. It's Bufus. Hey, dawg. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I just got out of... karate class. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You did? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it's great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't forget we have dinner at 7:00. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No problem. Your ninja will be there at 7:00 sharp! Unagi. Love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ooh. That was good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I got to learn some moves now. I got to hold up my end of the bargain. I think I've probably disappointed Kourtney a few too many times in our relationship. And I'm not looking to disappoint her again and tell her that... I've given up already on my new hobby. Don't know what I'm gonna do now. I don't think I need to know every move in the book. &gt;&gt; ROB: Literally, when you see Kourtney, just go through all these things with her. Kia! &gt;&gt; ROB: Hai! Kia! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Let's do this...! &gt;&gt; KRIS: My life can get so crazy, I forget to breathe. And this trip has really taught me that it's good to relax and it's good to laugh. We're gonna see the entire town of Sonoma. It's magical. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, you're amazing. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; BEN: Cheers, and welcome to Sonoma. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; BEN: Thanks for coming up. You cannot... not have fun in this place. I mean, look at that valley. This is why I never like to leave. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't blame you. I'm in love with it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'd like to take the first helicopter out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who brought Jonathan? &gt;&gt; BEN: Thanks, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Would you slap me upside the head the next time I have one of these bright ideas? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's messed up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: As much as I have fallen in love with Sonoma and have had the best time, I still feel a little guilty, and I'm afraid it's time to get back to my family. Bye, Jonathan. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Don't forget to go fast down the rolling hill. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa, look at this place, Mase. Hello? Thanks for seeing me. How are you? &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Oh. I'm good, good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. Scott. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: I'm Taichiro. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is Mason. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Hi, Mason. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hi. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: That's nice. All right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So basically, I just am trying to move up in this karate world as quick as possible. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Where are you right now? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Greenish. Moving to brown. I'm not looking to go black. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: And how long have you been training? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know if I want to say, hard. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: I have to be honest, I can't really give you anything that you don't deserve. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. So, let me... I-I should put on a... &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: W... Yeah. This sensei at the dojo doesn't seem too into taking shortcuts. I am. I did become royalty overnight. All right. So, how do we get started here? &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Um... do you know how to tie a belt? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm used to tying Hermes belts. This one's a little tougher. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Oh, it's a little different. This way, and then go underneath both. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, both? Oh! I'm, uh, just getting finished up with my sensei. This is my girlfriend Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you close to getting the black belt? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not my black belt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, I thought that's what you told me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How-how... do you think you just get a black belt overnight? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Isn't brown before black? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes. Right? a brown belt, yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, is he not a brown? &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: That's what I'm trying to figure out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, so what do we need to do so I can show you that I'm at least a brown? &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Well, start with kata. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to see your moves. âŞ âŞ &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Did you... miss something, did you add something...? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, I mean, I-I was just... improvising... on what I already knew just to kind of spice things up a little bit. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: I think no improvisation, no spices. I give you one more chance. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, so no mixing things, okay. One... two... three? &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Or was that two? &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: That was two, yeah. That was actually worse than the first time. Do you think you deserve to wear a brown belt, to be honest? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not sure I deserve a lot of things... &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Yes. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...but they come to me. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: And unfortunately, this is not one of those things. You have to earn it to wear it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What belt is he? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, let's not... let's not throw out any belt colors right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'd like to know. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: Right now you are a white belt, for sure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You had a purple on yesterday. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I moved up quick. &gt;&gt; TAICHIRO: No, you didn't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Leave it to Scott to not follow through with his therapy assignment, and it's just so frustrating-- if he put half as much energy into doing the karate as he did into not doing the karate, he would have at least learned something. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, should we go take Mason out to dinner, and we could discuss... some of my moves that I haven't shown you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, do you know what time you're meeting Bob tomorrow? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you don't show up, he's dropping you as a client. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's the story of my life. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Who are you calling? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm trying to get in touch with Lamar. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I have to have another face-to-face with the lawyer tomorrow. Oh... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Does it look blue and, like, thick? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, Kylie, you're... you know that your whole scalp is blue, and your ears are blue and your neck is blue. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Her ear, her scalp... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hold on, I'm gonna take a picture. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait. First help me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want me to wash your hair? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's a Smurf. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? It's not even hot. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, it got in my ear. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's okay. Um, excuse me. You're, like, licking my nipple. : What are you doing? Forward. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My neck doesn't bend like that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Just go for it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Turn your head around. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Aah! It's hot! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You did not wash this out. Look at the blue suds. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Kylie, look at the sink. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Make sure you're getting her scalp. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Here you go. Hello? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie and Kendall are here. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Kylie and Kendall are there? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Lamar. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, Lamar. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hi... guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, are you aware about tomorrow? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're having a face-to-face with Bob. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh. Bob...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shapiro, your lawyer? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Let me tell you. In jail, it was so cold... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You were in jail for 45 minutes, so, seriously, get over yourself. Do you know what time you're meeting Bob tomorrow? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh... no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's 3:00 p.m. sharp house. Like, you cannot be late. I do not want a warrant out for your arrest. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'll be there at 12:00. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I don't want you there at 12:00. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Okay, well, I'll see you tonight then. I'll bring dinner. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I'm... I'm... You can't... I'm working tonight, Lamar. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'll bring dinner tonight with champagne. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All I'm concerned about is tomorrow. If you don't show up, he's dropping you as a client. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's the story of my life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Even though Joe Odom has apologized for the things that he said about my family, Lamar still gets so down on himself. And I think with all this noise and chaos, everything is really beating him down and getting to him, and he really just wants to run from his problems instead of facing them head-on. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You guys cheered me up today. You know I love you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We all love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: When did you guys get back? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's wrong, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't understand why you guys would lie to me about where you were. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Aah! You looking at me? Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is this a joke? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want to see some moves? Obviously, the karate didn't work out for me. I figure I got to try something else that's active. &gt;&gt; TIM: And give me a little cross-over with the right foot. Bingo. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I do remember doing a lot of different things as a kid, and I thought tennis was pretty cool. And you can, like, throw your racket when you get mad. So it seems like something that's kind of up my alley. Why didn't you bow to me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would be so good at karate. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me see some &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll show you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Call me Sensei Lord. I'll knock you. Whoa! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow! You're actually pretty good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I'm loose. My sensei... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I got you twice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ow! That's not gonna break as easy as I thought. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, see, now this is what I'm talking about, Jonathan. This is how we do it. &gt;&gt; JACLYN: Yeah, these are all... &gt;&gt; KRIS: These are all clean? &gt;&gt; JACLYN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God, Jaclyn, you're good. The raisins go there. And then, if it looks like too many people put their hands in there, we have to start all over. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You are really turning into Mommie Dearest. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I had to once put these away because Kanye was, like... &gt;&gt; JACLYN: The peanuts. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...addicted, and he didn't want to eat 'em anymore, so I had to hide them from himself. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: These are the... I think the cashews are the best. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, don't... &gt;&gt; KIM: When did you guys get back? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, last night. You didn't hear us come in last night? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't understand why you guys would lie to me about where you were. Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; KIM: When did you guys get back? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, last night. You didn't hear us come in last night? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't understand why you guys would lie to me about where you were. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We weren't really lying. We just kept going. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, you said, you were, like, at Barney's. Then you said you were in Malibu. Then you're Instagramming photos in Sonoma... My mom and Jonathan have been completely MIA. They're saying they're one place, posting photos from Sonoma. I just don't understand why they're all trying to hide this from me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll admit I got a little carried away, 'cause I think, when you said that I wouldn't be fun to hang out with... I'm actually a lot of fun. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Malibu. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, and then we felt bad. We didn't want you... We felt like maybe you would get jealous. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not mad about that. It's just, don't lie. Like, I don't have time for it, you know? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It was stupid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we got a little carried away, and I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: All forgiven. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Can we have a big, group hug? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Group hug! &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I got to run. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? Get out of my bar! Oh, my, God, there's fingerprints! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What are you gonna do now?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look really sweet today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't like being sweet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Got it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, what's new with you? How was Sonom...? Where did you go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Actually, Sonoma was kind of cool. I forgot how pretty San Francisco is, and the Golden Gate Bridge... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do I really have to hear this whole story? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You wouldn't go up to Sonoma and get away from all of this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know how stupid that is right now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not stupid. It's... It would be cleansing, good for the soul. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Lamar came over last night... at 1:00 in the morning. He goes, "Where are you?" I was, like, "I'm at home. Please don't come here." He's, like, "I just miss you. I haven't seen you in, like, two months." "Like, I miss you, too, but, like, I can't see you." Of course, he comes to the house. I let him in. He's, like, "Can I sleep here tonight?" I'm, like, "No." It's just so sad. Like, I'm not laughing. I'm just, like, "Oh, my God." It was just crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He looked good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. It's just so confusing. No one knows what I'm going through, or what I'm feeling every day. I mean, I don't even know what I'm feeling every day. I wake up, and sometimes I'm really in a great mood, and sometimes I'm really angry and confused and irritated at life. And I just have to take it day by day, and live my life the best that I know how and do what I feel is best. Are you eating these fries? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just keep eating them. It's not normal. I'm not even hungry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's one way to kill an appetite. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I'm still want to have them. Would you get mad if I still ate them? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It would be a little creepy and weird, yeah. Keeping Up With the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been rehearsing for this role. &gt;&gt; MAN: The runway! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am a show queen! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scandal in Las Vegas. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait. I don't understand it. You're allowed to be topless here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What did we get ourselves into? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the? &gt;&gt; MAN: &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm home! Rob's house is where it's at, and it'll be like old times. &gt;&gt; ROB: You think cheese really goes right there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you getting so mad over cheese? What thedid you bring me back here for? You're kicking me out?
