- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, turn off that stupid movie! &gt;&gt; ROB: I have chlamydia. &gt;&gt; KIM: My eyes, I opened up a bottle of, um... &gt;&gt; ROB: Cristal? &gt;&gt; KIM: ... hand sanitizer, and it squirted right in my eye, and burned my eye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aren't you used to that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: With Kanye? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mmm, sounds like me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your boob is, like, leaking out of control! &gt;&gt; KIM: It is? Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is happening? &gt;&gt; ROB: What the? That weirds me out for real. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa! &gt;&gt; ROB: That just weirded me out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is like a water fountain. &gt;&gt; KIM: Only on one side. Interesting. Okay, sorry. 19 00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,850 &gt;&gt; ROB: See you, guys. It's been fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When I was 17 years old, I moved out and I, like, lived on my own... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you married a man 15 years older than you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was your dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you lied to how old you were. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You did? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How old did you say you were? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A lot older. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. This is crazy. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Whipped cream. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The saddest thing about this little dessert, it's, like, ceremoniously devastating because this is Lamar's favorite dessert. He would love it if he was here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where am I gonna sleep tonight, guys? 34 00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,865 &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. Not that this is exciting for you, but Scott is leaving for, like, two weeks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Absolutely not am I staying at your house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Absolutely not. Right now, my personal life is a little chaotic. And I just, I hate being at home. Like-like, my brother's gone, like, I don't want to be at home by myself. So I've basically thrown all my bare necessities into some suitcases, and I'm kind of living out of my car right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I'm kind of excited and scared at the same time. I mean, the talk show's over. For the summer. And now we don't know what to do with all my spare time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I keep seeing online that it's canceled. Is that true? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not canceled. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think, no matter what, whatever is meant to be, me and you had so much fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it was, like, "here's your dream come true, you're doing this amazing talk show." And if it never goes anything beyond that, I had the best summer of my life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you gonna cry now, too? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm just... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. She, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw. This is my emotional turmoil taking over me. 60 00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:50,203 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, suck it, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, then. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We got to pace ourselves. &gt;&gt; ROB: We're walking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Going downhill. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yup. It took me a couple months to get in the groove, but I'm here. &gt;&gt; MAN: I know, Rob! Kill it! &gt;&gt; ROB: Work, Pandora, work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, Rob. Come on, Rob, you can do it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get those love handles going. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, living with Khloe and Lamar, it was very easy for me to fall off my routine, 'cause Khloe stocked the pantry with literally everything Lamar wanted. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert. &gt;&gt; ROB: Junk food and candy. So ever since I moved out of Khloe's, I've been getting my life in order. Khloe, that was hard, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; ROB: You want this towel? And I just want to have a really happy, positive year. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: One, two, three. &gt;&gt; GROUP: Hey! Chicago. We are on Broadway. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We're going to the theater. ♫ We're going to the theater. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: And you have a scarf on. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I feel very sophisticated, going to the theater. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I came to New York for a meeting this week. And one of the things I love to do when I'm in New York is go to a Broadway play. My mom has taken me to musicals and plays since I was a little girl. &gt;&gt; USHER: Here you go, sweetheart, enjoy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you so much. Thank you. And ever since she took me to Sweet I fell in love with singing and dancing, although I typically do it in the privacy of my own bedroom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was amazing. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That was great. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hello. Welcome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is awesome! Oh, my God, oh, my God. You guys look so fabulous. &gt;&gt; BIANCA: So lovely to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're beautiful. &gt;&gt; DONNA: Thank you. You look gorgeous, as usual. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We were singing along to your last number. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She is just like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm like, "I could do this." &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: ...thinking she could be up here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I could. &gt;&gt; DONNA: Oh, my God, totally come play with us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are so awesome. Can we take a shot? &gt;&gt; DONNA: Oh, my God, yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we're gonna Instagram this. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Jazz hands. Oh, yes. Get it, girls and boy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you get one? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I got, like, 10,000 photos in the last two minutes. 112 00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:14,247 &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Think she's like a Broadway star right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, you should have more pictures of me around your house. &gt;&gt; ROB: I have two family photos and one birthday picture. That's three pictures. You tied Kim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I should not tie Kim. &gt;&gt; ROB: What movie are you trying to watch tonight? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are we watching a movie together? You want to hang out with me more? &gt;&gt; ROB: Maybe if you want me to school you on some movies, I'm pretty good at that. That's kind of my trap with the ladies. house? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean... Staying at Mom's when Kim, a baby, a baby nurse, Kendall... It just, like, I am so grateful that Mom's letting me stay there, but it's too stressful. I just cannot live out of my car any... Like, literally, my car has duffel bags on duffel bags just in it. &gt;&gt; ROB: I told you, I told you I have extra rooms, you're more than welcome to stay here. And we got brand-new beds and towels and sheets. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought you were trying to get away from me. &gt;&gt; ROB: I am, but if you need to live somewhere and be comfortable, then you... What am I gonna do? You got to live somewhere. It's just temporary. I love Khloe, and she doesn't feel comfortable in her house right now, and I want to be there for her. She let me live with her and Lamar. But at the same time, we have a tendency to just get very codependent on one another. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really miss you, but I'm good. &gt;&gt; ROB: And, literally, all I want to do is just stay focused on my plan. It's just been way too long of me being unhappy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See you later. I'll see you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was so much fun. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We haven't done New York all together for a long time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we haven't. It's been a minute. I was thinking-- promise not to laugh-- I would do something on Broadway. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Ooh. ♫ La, la, la, da-da-da-da, da-da. ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You always come up with this stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because, I-I... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is unbeliev... Where does she come up with this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we just wrapped the show, right? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I enjoy the... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: The live audience? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...excitement and the audience, and I think that I am kind of into this. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Into this, you mean into what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm into being on Broadway. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Stop. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Since when? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What... What do you mean? "Into being on Broadway" means, like, in a Broadway show? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why not? Why not? Who says no? I definitely love to dream big and really go after a challenge, and this feels like a challenge. I think that if we were to do something and I moved to New York for a couple of weeks, just to have a little fun. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'd be happy if you were in New York. You could literally stay at my place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? I did the talk show, and that was my biggest dream at that time. It just goes to show you never stop dreaming. ♫ Oh yeah, baby! ♫ 176 00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,651 &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: ♫ Excuse me, could I get a ravioli with truffles? ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; TOMER: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Tom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys, it's time to start ordering Christmas trees. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where am I gonna put mine? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Next door. &gt;&gt; TOMER: We're gonna go see the house next door. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And by the way, then you could start figuring out where they want to go, you could look at other places. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney has been definitely pushing me to rent the house, like, directly next to hers. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, let's go next door. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, let's go. I mean, literally, she's been saying, "And we could build a tunnel that could connect our houses, so we could all hang out." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yo, this is a nice little area to come home to. I think we're into it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is a nice feng shui. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, I don't like living in other people's homes. &gt;&gt; TOMER: They do want you to leave the covers, though. : On the furniture. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For the six months that I'm here? I mean, it's a cute little number, but not my steez. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, are you joking, man? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, what's the big to-do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You only want it 'cause I'm next door to you. You would never do this, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but how fun would that be to be next door? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't get a good feng shui here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So do you want to get a hotel? And get clothes and then Sydney could do weekly clothing trips? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I guess. I don't know. Why are you pushing me so much, though? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I just feel like you've said you don't feel comfortable in your house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Renting a house or buying a home is so permanent, and I'm not there right now. I mean, I love my home. It just obviously has, like, a 213 00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,952 little darkness that we need to clean out. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not gonna help me with my luggage? You're the man. I am actually really excited that Rob has asked me to stay with him for a little bit. Shacking up with Kendall has been fun, but Kris Jenner's house has way too many people. Yay, where are we going, Robbie? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm putting you in the casual white room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And my emotions are so all over the place. I need a second to do things my way and in my time. Can I change these? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, these are nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But what if I just replace them with my own lamps? &gt;&gt; ROB: Just don't get makeup all over the sheets. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would I get makeup all over the sheets? I'm sleeping in here. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I see the other room? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this the sex room? &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh, no, that's my room. I don't do that in other rooms. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Let's go to your room. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're definitely not going in my room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like how big this bed is. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, it's good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you think I could sleep in here? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, your mattress is so comfortable. &gt;&gt; ROB: Get off my bed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I like your bed. I just want to sleep here with you. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, I'm gonna give this a chance with Khloe living with me... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can we Instagram our friendship bracelets now? &gt;&gt; ROB: ...but I just really hope that having her back in my house doesn't throw me off my whole routine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks, Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ever since New York, I have been obsessing about performing on Broadway. I am a show queen! &gt;&gt; ROB: You think cheese really goes right there like that? I'm trying to lose 60 pounds. I'm not trying to lose, like, five pounds or ten pounds. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look what I did for you, Robbie. 252 00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,965 &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yes, cheese. So I can get fatter. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ever since New York, I have been obsessing about fulfilling my dream of performing on Broadway. &gt;&gt; BOB: Morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; BOB: I'm fine. I brought this for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, thank you so much. &gt;&gt; BOB: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mwah. But if I'm gonna go out on a limb here and put myself out there on a big stage and try to sing and dance, then I want to be prepared. So I want to take some vocal lessons and also take some dance lessons. &gt;&gt; BOB: Okay, we're gonna do these exercises. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BOB: And then we'll go to the song. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BOB: So you're gonna go... ♫ No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no ♫ Like biting an apple. &gt;&gt; BOTH: ♫ No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no ♫ &gt;&gt; BOB: That's right. Okay. &gt;&gt; BOTH: ♫ No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no ♫ &gt;&gt; BOB: Great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bob Garrett is one of the best vocal coaches in the business. &gt;&gt; BOB: Now feel the jaw drop. &gt;&gt; BOTH: ♫ Hey... ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: He has been hired by major A-list actors to help them take the stage. &gt;&gt; BOB: Okay, you are completely surprising me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am? &gt;&gt; BOB: Yes. At how quick you're doing this and how well you're doing this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; BOB: I'm just sayin'. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, give me five. Yeah. &gt;&gt; BOB: Give me ten. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ten. &gt;&gt; BOB: You also have perfect pitch, just saying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that his 285 00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:03,683 feedback is kind of awesome. ♫ ♫ It's kind of inspiring. 288 00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,827 ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BOB: You had me till "nightly brawl." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know! 292 00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,639 ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? This is just... with the shoes? Come on, mate. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is my strip moves. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is j... This is not comforting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Comforting? Is that what strippers are? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Even Ye rapped about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I forgot to ask you. Cici told me that she saw a humongous billboard. You are hosting a party at a strip club in Vegas? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? No. I don't think that's the case. I saw an e-mail about some party in Vegas, but... nothing else. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: An e-mail about what? Don't you care about, like, if people just could use your name and not... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I saw an offer for Vegas, but I didn't accept it or take it, so there's no way there's any billboards with me on it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, there is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not hosting any parties at any strip clubs. So somebody's mistaken. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sometimes I may let Scott get away with things just because it's easier and I don't have time to deal, but Scott thinks he is so slick, like this little sneaky guy doing appearances under the radar, but I know what's happening. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Strip for me, baby. Do me... Oh, yeah. Holler if you hear me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's my best move. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's your only move. I liked it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Trash. &gt;&gt; ROB: Smells very feminine-like. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! Don't you like it? All the candles. I might have to do a little fixing, though, 'cause some things don't make sense in here. &gt;&gt; ROB: Where are all my protein powders? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're in the drawer. And, look, we're gonna, like, display this like this. &gt;&gt; ROB: I have this.. the scent of all these wack-ass candles. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This pad of paper needs to be by your phone. &gt;&gt; ROB: You think cheese really goes right there like that? When I live alone, all I have in my fridge is water, my protein powders and that's it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you getting so mad over cheese? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's not about cheese. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna put that away. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's about this being my Look at all my-- it's nowhere. All I want to do is stay focused on my plan. I need to do things my way, and Khloe is interfering with that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dinner's ready. Look what I did for you, Robbie. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yes, cheese. So I can get fatter. So much fun. I just don't want to deal with all this &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm trying to lose 60 pounds. I'm not trying to lose, like, five pounds or ten pounds, so I need to literally dedicate my entire life to my fitness. I got to go to sleep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want a bite of chicken? &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh-uh, uh-uh. I've been the most unhappiest person for about a year and a half, and it's very, very easy to just fall off the wagon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Want a bite? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Let me hear what you got. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, don't you have to have, like, a good voice, though? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, The Redas are here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott has an appearance in Las Vegas. Him and Chris are trying to be sneaky about it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're just shopping. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so excited to 360 00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:45,204 go just bust them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How funny. That's when I was babysitting that kid. He's crying and I'm literally texting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, you were super rude back then. Ow, man! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does that really hurt? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, but it's annoying when I'm a little sunburnt. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, the Redas are here. &gt;&gt; NICOLE: How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Chris and Nicole are close family friends who live in New York, and they're in town visiting us. What do we want to do tomorrow in the day? &gt;&gt; NICOLE: Let's plan our fun day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you guys want to go to the beach on Sunday? We could also go to... to Bernatoni's. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's too far. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We could go to Nobu's on Saturday night. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We were gonna go to the city and have lunch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't want to all go do something together? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're gonna be with each other all weekend. Can Chris and I have a few minutes to just go... &gt;&gt; NICOLE: This is a short couple of days. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We could go to Neiman's and have lunch there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, perfect. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nicole and I know that Scott has an appearance in Las Vegas and that him and Chris are trying to be sneaky about it. So we are trying to catch them in their shadiness. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys are gonna go shopping, we're gonna go shopping, and we'll meet up after. So, we got our plans set for tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Do you want to go upstairs? We're gonna go schmooze. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Schmooze. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, obviously they're not gonna tell us about Vegas. Scott must think Nicole and I are the biggest idiots in town. I gave Scott such the perfect opportunity to come clean. Like, what if we said, like, "We want to come with you guys"? &gt;&gt; NICOLE: No, no. Let's just go. We should just go there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And just show up? It's only, like, a two-hour thing-- we could literally go for, like, an hour. I say we hop on a plane and we leave after they leave. &gt;&gt; NICOLE: Their faces are going to drop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're some bad-ass bitches. Scandal... in Las Vegas. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SPENCER: I'm actually gonna teach you the ABC's of dance, so I think it's a great place to start with you. You want to keep your head and your chest up. Think "out." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have hired Spencer Liff to be my dance coach. He's one of the most sought-after choreographers in the business. If you can't dance and sing at the same time on Broadway, then you're pretty much toast. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: When you step forward... inside. Yes. You'll want to come through and down, and through and down. Nice. Think, like, "evil queen." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm good at that. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm good at evil queen. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: I think you're a little, like, closet musical theater show queen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really am. 419 00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:29,568 I am a show queen! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, Robert. How are you? Do you guys want to sit down and...? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: So, this, guys, is the couture, this is the next collection that's going out. I'll just, like, scan through them. &gt;&gt; ROB: Adam and Ryan, they've been my friends since fourth grade, and they started a shoe company. &gt;&gt; RYAN: The different patterns are what make it unique. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ADAM: I think they're cool. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, they have a shoe line, I have a sock line, so it's just a perfect collab, so I want to show them my warehouse and see, you know, if we can work together. &gt;&gt; RYAN: It's a nice warehouse. &gt;&gt; ADAM: It's real clean. &gt;&gt; RYAN: So many socks. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; RYAN: This would be, like, a dog's heaven. &gt;&gt; ROB: Um, you know, Khloe pretty much is moving into my new spot with me. &gt;&gt; RYAN: How long is she gonna be there for? &gt;&gt; ROB: I gave Khloe, like, open arms to whatever she needs. She's only been open-arms to me. I obviously offered to her, 'cause she's going through a lot right now, but I feel like I'm going backwards and I'm back in the situation where, like, I'm being more unproductive. &gt;&gt; ADAM: It's like a role-reversal, how things changed. &gt;&gt; ROB: I know. I still feel like I am having to hold myself back from, like, trying to do trying to accomplish. Like, I moved out specifically to be my own man and figure out all this business stuff where we're at, and health and fitness, and... it's just a weird situation. Khloe and I obviously are extremely close. Honestly, sometimes I feel like I'm her... husband, like, literally. But it's just time for me to focus on doing everything for me. &gt;&gt; ADAM: But don't make it so that it's your sole focus in your life. &gt;&gt; RYAN: You got to be your own man. &gt;&gt; ROB: Exactly. "You can sleep here, but let me flourish." ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is that water? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's, like, water with gas. It's a brand-new thing and it's insane. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I have a sip of that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I love that song. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No. You're still singing this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. You didn't even know I was taking dance lessons, did you? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You actually went through with this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, dance lessons? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dance lessons. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I thought you were joking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. I actually... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We went to see and she told me she wants to be in it. I thought it was a goof. We went backstage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what I liked about it, is when I was doing the singing and dancing lessons, I thought about nothing else. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, they want you to Chicago? wants to be in the play. want her to be in the play. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I don't know how the audition process actually works... but... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Like, have you even spoken to anybody at all? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you need to, like, get your agent on this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Would you feel bad at all for the people buying the tickets? 'Cause they're gonna have to sit through you and not have a professional. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: Broadway is serious. I feel like you should respect it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know if I could do it. That would be a really scary thing to do. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I don't think she's nervous at all. Let me hear what you got. She was singing along while we were there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just gonna give you my very first move, okay? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, this is my... 493 00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,843 Okay, so imagine the music. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What-what town are you singing about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're high. My rib hurts. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, this is really good. I think... a comedy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, don't you have to have, like, a good voice, though? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have been working so hard to build up my confidence, and feel like I could really do this, because I have a deep passion for this, and for Kim to actually laugh at me, it really brings me down. Well, I need to get back to work, and I need you guys not to laugh every time I show you something that I'm working on, 509 00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:17,129 because it's a buzz-kill. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; NICOLE: I just hope that... they better be happy when we get there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The only thing I could see backfiring is if Scott, he likes to use things as an excuse, so I could see him being, like, "Oh, well, then we're gonna stay and we're gonna, you know, party all night." &gt;&gt; NICOLE: Look at those shoes! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm assuming that Scott and Chris are taking a private plane, so we're hoping that we're not gonna run into them at the airport. 520 00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:52,498 All righty! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; NICOLE: I would switch shoes with you, but I'm not your size. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's okay. What size are you? &gt;&gt; NICOLE: Seven. Now I'm anxious! You're gonna call him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We just had lunch at Stanley's. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How was it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was good. And now we're just heading back to the house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, we're just shopping. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so we'll see you back at... in a couple hours, or what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, like, an hour, if we're able to hustle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And are we still gonna have dinner? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. We'll go to Nobu if you want. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, love you, too. Here it is. Aah...! &gt;&gt; NICOLE: I'm ready. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm kind of nervous of how they're gonna react, but we are so excited to go just bust them. &gt;&gt; DEEJAY: Scott Disick's in the house! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What did we get ourselves into? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, I don't understand. You're allowed to be topless here? What the?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I've been rehearsing for this role on Broadway. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris thinks she could do anything. A Broadway play? Eh... Jury's still out on that one. &gt;&gt; ROB: What the hell are you all doing right now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're having a slumber party. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm starting to realize that everything I didn't want to happen is now happening. &gt;&gt; RYAN: She's been here for a week and it's hers now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Popcorn's ready. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What theare you doing? Hold on. What the? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're here. Let's get this party started! Whoo! We're here to party! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I look in back of me, and I see Kourtney standing there like a little freak. She's like MacGyver. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're here to support you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think she may have a tracking device on me. I don't understand what you guys think we're up to. You realize wherever we go, everybody's watching. What did you think, you were gonna get here and I was gonna freak out? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You never know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wish I could say that these little games of running around keep Kourtney on her toes and an exciting relationship, but that's probably not the case. I think Kourtney would like if I never left the neighborhood. Or the town, maybe, the t... okay, the town. Oh, you didn't miss it! We're shaving his head! &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh! &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Oh, wow! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Wow. 577 00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:55,080 &gt;&gt; MAN 3: No! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, babe. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I bought that for you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You actually got that for me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll take it. Got any ice cream? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ice cream? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. We got a vanilla ice cream. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I've been rehearsing for this role on Broadway. Don't laugh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No... &gt;&gt; KRIS: How come everybody laughs at me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not laughing at you. I mean, is it a singing role? Then I would laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Singing and dancing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris thinks she can do anything. And you know what? In most cases, she can. A Broadway play? I don't know. The jury's still out on that one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's really ambitious and crazy, but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That is really, really ambitious, yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I got really excited about this... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...because I started working with professionals, and the singing coach... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He better be really good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...was telling me that I was hitting all the notes, and I felt good about myself, but then, I did a little dance in front of Kim and Jonathan, and they, like, told me to never dance in front of anybody ever again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: First of all, you do what you want to do. Remember my old line? The ability to grow is directly related to the amount of insecurity you can take in your life. Basically, stepping out and doing things that you're not secure with. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But you get out the other side, you'll be a better person. You know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If this day job thing doesn't work out for you, you could be a really good motivational speaker one day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Right. 617 00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:33,178 Anyway, the apple pie's good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Bugsy Brown. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You never hang out in here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I like it in here. It's kind of relaxing just to come and sit back and think about all the money I made today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, I just wanted to know, why the need to lie... about going to Vegas? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, it's not about that I needed to lie. I just felt like I didn't want to hear all the reasons why I shouldn't be hosting a party. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't you think honesty is the best policy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Honestly? Not always. I knew that I could get the appearance done and get home. Never in a million years will I do that again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't expect you to be a genius or responsible. I just expect you to be honest. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, so I'm honestly telling you, I lied, and I went to Vegas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Of course a woman knows what her man is up to. You just can't mess with a woman's intuition. There's just nothing like it. You can't outsmart a smarty-pants. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't you just put, like, a little monitor on me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm down with that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I bet you are. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's practice our moves for Vegas. This is what we're going to do in the club. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dude, you guys are annoying! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: I come home with my boys to obviously talk about some business, and I hear something, like, Khloe having a party, and that's not what my place is for. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the Yolanda-Twanda move. &gt;&gt; ROB: What the hell are you all doing right now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're having a slumber party. &gt;&gt; ROB: With a bunch of Chinese food and Ding Dongs and? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't really get why Rob is overreacting. I've been where Rob is, but I think Rob just kind of has to take control. I mean, nothing's ever perfect. &gt;&gt; ADAM: Already made yourself at home with the candy... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, we did. &gt;&gt; RICH: She's been... she's been here for a week, and it's hers now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'll see if my popcorn's ready. &gt;&gt; ROB: You guys literally look like idiots. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; ROB: 'Cause you guys are dancing around while I'm trying to meet with these fools to talk about some Living with Khloe and Lamar, like, yeah, we stayed up all night and did whatever we wanted to do. Ever since I've been living with myself, I've been, you know, going to sleep early, waking up early, focusing the whole day on my socks and other businesses. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Twanda! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, she's Yolanda, and I'm Twanda. &gt;&gt; ROB: Your guys's names are stupid. The last thing I need is to be staying up late all night and just throwing my whole schedule and routine out of whack, and I'm starting to realize that everything I didn't want to happen is now happening. We're trying to have a meeting regarding all this stuff right now. We're gonna have to throw shoes on the couch, and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're having a slumber party. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, you all need to get out of here for real. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I live here, though. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm sorry. Let's... start over. What is wrong with my mind? &gt;&gt; SPENCER: I want you to eliminate the timidness. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want to be a joke. I can't do this today. &gt;&gt; BOB: Yes, you can. &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe, you want to come in the back with me for a sec? The reason why I moved into that place is to really focus and get mytogether. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: With you in there, it's 688 00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,030 kind of like impeding the process. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: All right, let's go. &gt;&gt; BOB: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Pop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sorry. Can we start over? I was in the middle of a swallow. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: I'm not doing it with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'm just going for it. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Five, six, seven, 698 00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,326 eight. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: It really doesn't matter if Kim or anyone else wants to laugh at me. If being on Broadway is my dream, then it's my dream. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BOB: Aah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: &gt;&gt; SPENCER: "Noisy hall." &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is wrong with my mind? &gt;&gt; SPENCER: It's a hall like a dance hall. It's a noisy hall. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Noisy hall. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Where there's a... &gt;&gt; SPENCER and KRIS: Nightly brawl. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just like my house. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, here we go. ♫ ♫ Oh. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: That's gonna be the death of me, that part. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But now I just can't get it together today. I can't do this today. &gt;&gt; BOB: Yes, you can. I know you can. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm sorry. Let's start over. &gt;&gt; BOB: It's, "No, I'm no one's wife." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; BOB: It's "No, I'm no... No, I'm no one's wife." &gt;&gt; SPENCER: It's the exact same note. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, it is? &gt;&gt; SPENCER: And you get timid. It's a mental thing. That's why I said that you always belt out that... "No, I'm..." It's the same note. I think we can take a little bit of a breath. I want you to eliminate the timidness. If you have any shred of doubt in you that you are not good enough to do it, then it's gonna read. &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How's it going? &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: Great so far. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: Yeah. Been training a little bit, telling... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you have, like, a lot of changes? &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: I mean, a few, but I think, once everything starts coming along, then I can do a training with all of the stores. Right now, it's not really where I would want it to be. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm, okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: Chuck-O. Chucky. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, what's up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, we... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is Dakota. &gt;&gt; ROB: How you doing? &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: Hi. Good to meet you. &gt;&gt; ROB: What's up? Robert. &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe, you want to come in the back with me for a sec? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; ROB: 'Cause I have to tell you something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, what did you bring me back here for? &gt;&gt; ROB: Like, how you've been staying with me and everything. Like, I don't feel like I have my own... It's not my own space, and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ugh! What? You're kicking me out? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been thinking about going out for a play. &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: Oh, my goodness. Do you have any idea what you're getting into? You're going to feel like a monkey in the zoo. &gt;&gt; ROB: Like, I don't feel like I have my own... It's not my own space. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ugh. What? You're kicking me out? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I'm not kicking you out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But? &gt;&gt; ROB: The reason why I moved into that place is just to really focus and get my together, like health, fitness. Like, those are my... That's my main goal right now and that's it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: With you in there, it's kind of, like, impeding the process for me. I literally feel like I'm just going back to being in your house. I love having you there, and I... trust me, I hate living alone-- it's not fun. But you're just a distraction. I sound like you talking to me now, but, um, I think we should have some agreement. But just... I can't impede my health. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I totally get it. I think it's phenomenal of Rob to want to be independent and do things his way. I mean, I guess I just have to go back home. I got to rip off the Band-Aid. I mean, I love living with you. 773 00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:53,445 But I get it, though. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kath, it's Kris. &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: Hi, darling. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm okay, I'm okay. I called, actually, because I was thinking about you. I remember taking Kendall and Kylie to watch their godmother, you, do Broadway. Do you remember when you were Miss Hannigan? &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: Oh, okay. Yeah, that was at the Garden. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Madison Square Garden. &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right? And so I've really been thinking about maybe going out for a play. &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. Don't laugh. &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: No, I'm not laughing. Do you have any idea what you're getting into? The-the amount of discipline you have to have... you can't even imagine it unless you've done it. We did nine shows a week for five weeks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: I know it. You'd lose your mind. These are people... that do nothing else. You have to devote yourself completely to it, and I don't see you, with everything else going on in your life, having the time to do that. Eight shows a week-- you're gonna feel like a monkey in the zoo. I don't see it working with your life, sweetie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I agree. I've got so much going on. Kim just had a baby, the kids need me more than ever. I cannot give up my entire life to perform on Broadway. And although the time might not be right this very second, I really want to continue to practice and rehearse so that when the time is right, I'll be ready. Talking to you has, like, given me a lot of clarity, and I really appreciate your advice. &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: Give everybody my love, sweetheart. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I will. I love you so much. &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: You stay close to God, my friend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I will. &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: All right, Kris. Love you, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. I love you. &gt;&gt; KATHIE LEE: Bye-bye, doll. 813 00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:49,561 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think Lamar's a little scared of me now 'cause I was very firm and I went off on him. Oh, and he's also trying to go to Buffalo, New York, and I said, "You can't go until after your court appearance." &gt;&gt; MAN: About ten minutes? &gt;&gt; MAKEUP ARTIST: She's ready. &gt;&gt; MAN: She's ready. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, ten minutes. &gt;&gt; MAN: Ten minutes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm not taking his calls; I have to sleep. I have work to do. Okay, we'll talk later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's such a fine line 'cause you don't know what to do and you don't want to feel like you're not there. It is hard to hear Khloe in this state of limbo. I think that's just such a hard place to be in when you're unsure of what is gonna happen next. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am in such a bad mood. &gt;&gt; KIM: What... What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nothing. I don't care. I just want to go home and go to sleep. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. Well, when you're ready to talk, I'm all ears. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He ruined my one good day. Let's shoot. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Here we go. Oh, that's gorg... I love that. Lean on Khloe like that. So pretty. Gorgeous and sexy. Oh, my God. Perfect. I think these are amazing. Thank you, girls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar's like, "Can you get Travoris out of my loft?" And I was like, "No." The loft is done-- we're done with the loft. We have a loft that we've had downtown to be close to Staples. We're leasing it, and, you know, the lease is coming up. I've asked Lamar, "Hey, do you want to extend it?" He said no. It's out of my hands. &gt;&gt; KIM: But where is he gonna go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. I can't deal with all this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you really thought of selling the house? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe just really needs to cut the umbilical cord because I feel like she's in such a place where she just is kind of stuck. She's at a standstill, and I want her to, like, find that joy of life again. Has it, like, been in your thought process that you might want to really sell your house? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to sell my house. I know I have to. Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar's like, "Can you get Travoris out of my loft?" No. The loft is done-- we're done with the loft. &gt;&gt; KIM: But where is he gonna go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. I can't deal with all this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Has it, like, been in your thought process that you might want to really sell your house? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to sell my house. I know I have to. But I need time to do that, and I don't have time to go and look and... do all this &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, no, I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, magically, how am I gonna get a house? Now that I won't be living at Rob's, my next step, I guess, is just to go back home and go back into that environment and face my house. I don't know what's happening in my life, but I guess this would be the first step. &gt;&gt; KIM: If mine's ever ready, you can move in. 876 00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,856 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks, boo. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Walking into my house 881 00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:34,452 for the first time, it is a weird feeling. I feel like it's so empty. Like there's just no life inside the house. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Watch my photo shoot, baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's my hat. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Don't you like how I rock it, hmm? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take your shirt off. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, yeah, baby. Baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wish I could just erase everything bad that's happened. But it's not that easy. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KIM: You should just do a little bonding in between your teeth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim has been very critical. &gt;&gt; KIM: It just looks like a piece of pepper. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She has an opinion about everything. You have way too much time on your hands. &gt;&gt; KIM: Me? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why are you out here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim has been doing her makeup in my bathroom for about three hours. Kim has started to take this a little too far. &gt;&gt; KIM: All of this is mine-- my sunglasses, all my things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How much longer are you gonna be here? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, eight months. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Eight months? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kanye wants us all in San Fran for Kim's birthday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That doesn't make you nervous? You don't, like, wonder what it's for?
