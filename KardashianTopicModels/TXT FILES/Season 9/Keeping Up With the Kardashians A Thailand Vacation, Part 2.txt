- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's Thailand, ladies and gentlemen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this a joke? He's not coming? Rob and I were supposed to leave together, but Rob was M.I.A. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is incredible. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ready, go! Go! Go! &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't, I can't. I don't want to do it! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want to go on a vacation where we relax. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Guys, defend me. &gt;&gt; LEAH: He's got a point. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My plan is not working. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What plan? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I talked to Kim to distract him. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why are you lying to us? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're just so nosy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nothing. I'm over it, I'm over it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I overhear my mom making some kind of plan and I just feel like they're lying to us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You, too, Kylie? &gt;&gt; KIM: Brandon? You have a full lizard on you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, yeah? &gt;&gt; LEAH: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: He has a lizard on him. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Will you get it off? &gt;&gt; LEAH: You actually have a lizard? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-uh, you're lying. &gt;&gt; KIM: I swear. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God, it's crawling! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's, like, a little lizard. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't move. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, it's-it's tiny, Brandon, it's so little. Oh, my God, look at it right there-- look, look, look! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's cute. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, my God, I love that little guy! Why-why you scared? It's a little baby. Oh, oh! He jumped. Whoa! My gosh! Where is he? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Who wants to jump in the ocean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, Leah. Got to go! See you! Come on! I know that Kendall and Kylie aren't happy with me right now. But at any given time, at least one person in my family is mad at me. So, I'm gonna give this argument a break. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Are you really doing this with me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm really glad that Brandon and Brody and Leah are here. Because I'm actually having some fun and they really make me laugh. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I'm so proud of you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: And if it's still doing that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get the sand on my ass, like, that type of shot. You know? &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: We're gonna do it... &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER 2: We need a coconut! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh! Crab! &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: What is that? &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Wait, we need a coconut. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can we sit in the sand first? &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Yeah... &gt;&gt; KIM: Just a little bit. Brody walking in on my selfie shoot was just super awkward. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Ooh! Hey! Hey! Hey! Kim, what are you doing?! ! &gt;&gt; KIM: But I still really want to find beautiful backdrops and locations and make some really cute pictures. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER 2: So, sit right here and then cheat your ass off. Yeah, totally off. That's perfect. Can you cheat your ass out more or are you gonna fall? &gt;&gt; KIM: My literal vagina is hanging out. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Okay, twist the other way. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Yes. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Now, arch back. You're gonna.. &gt;&gt; KIM: Should I roll in the sand? &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER 2:Thai. Hi. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi. Can I have a little bit of your butt? &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Sure! &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Oh, we got water. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look really pretty, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Kim, are these your shades? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: They're actually really nice... &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, right? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't tell if you're going skiing... &gt;&gt; KIM: I actually like them on you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are fashion forward, that's why. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you think, Leah? &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's... They're you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, it's not even like Kendall and Kylie not to be down here for breakfast. Where are they? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll go get them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're messing with us 'cause they got mad last night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ky? Ky? Kylie? Kenny? Ken? Where the hell could they be? Ken? You guys, they're not in their rooms. They come in my room every morning. I haven't seen them once. &gt;&gt; KIM: They didn't tell you that they were leaving? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're not? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I have no idea where they are. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I just wrote them and said, "Where are you?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna call them. Okay. She's not answering. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where the hell did these girls go? What happened last night? They were in there last night, and you were talking to them. I walked in, and they both, everybody rushes out. What was going on? What did they get pissed off about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't put this on me. I will be in shock if Kendall and Kylie really ran away. But they don't speak the language. They have no idea what they're doing. And for me, that's a little scary. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What happened last night?! I don't understand. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They got upset. They just, they got upset. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, here's Brody. Maybe he knows. Brod, we can't find Kendall and Kylie. Were they with you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you seen them this morning? &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, absolutely not. &gt;&gt; KIM: Being out by themselves is not safe. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm trying to get some breakfast. Let me tell you something. This is not... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we don't have time for breakfast. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Whoa, whoa, whoa... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to go find the girls. We'll break into two groups. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But go where? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll see if anybody's seen them... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hold on. Wait, wait, wait... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then we'll call the police. &gt;&gt; BRODY: They're obviously trying to mess with all of us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it's working. Let's go! Let's go! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think anybody really understands how a mom feels when she doesn't know where her kids are no matter how old they are. So everybody just needs to leave me alone and let me freak out. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you being serious? I'm trying to get some breakfast, you guys are talking about Kendall and Kylie missing? They don't... they don't go missing together. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I know, but, but at the same, on the same accord, it's, like, they are two teenage kids alone... &gt;&gt; BRODY: How far can they get? Let's be honest. How far can Kendall and Kylie get? You guys can go look all you want, it's, like, I'm not gonna play into it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, where is everybody? Can we show a sense of urgency? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. They're coming, they're coming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just tell them to hurry up! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're coming, they're coming. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: We got to go to town. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Which way is town? Everybody keep their eyes open. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did those girls check in here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you seen two girls? No? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Answer the phone. &gt;&gt; KIM: We all thought, like, Khloe is gonna move in with Rob and we're gonna have this eye on him. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Obviously, it's just too, it's too much. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I want to talk to him and be like, "Get your together." It's like you can't because he has issues. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you being serious? I'm trying to get some breakfast, you guys are talking about Kendall and Kylie missing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, where is everybody? Can we show a sense of urgency? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. They're coming, they're coming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just tell them to hurry up! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're coming, they're coming. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You guys can go look all you want. I'm not gonna play their stupid game. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't understand, like, what makes them think it's okay to just leave, and why they wouldn't say anything to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wouldn't even venture out here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My family and I have decided we're gonna split up into two cars and try to find Kendall and Kylie. First Rob bails on the trip and he won't tell us what is wrong. And now Kendall and Kylie run off and are missing somewhere to prove some sort of point. I mean, this is, like, the vacation from hell. Answer thephone. Hi. I have a question. Did those girls check in here? No? What's another hotel by here? That way? Perfect. Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everybody keep their eyes open. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I do have this feeling that we're gonna see them drive by on a scooter and, like, pull over... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Let's go. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi. We are looking for two teenagers, dark hair... &gt;&gt; KRIS: One is about six feet tall, like this tall, and the other one's my height. Nothing at all? &gt;&gt; CLERK: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Where's the nearest, like, taxi stand? &gt;&gt; CLERK: Across the street. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Across the street? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, go ask the taxi stand! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hi. Have you guys seen two girls? Teenagers? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you seen two girls? One's six-feet tall and one's a little bit shorter. No? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, well, they took a cab from here, huh? Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nothing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yes, yes. They took a taxi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, they took a taxi. They said they were going to town. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: So, we got to go to town. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Which way is town? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, that way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Ask this guy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go. Let's step on it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, at least that's a little helpful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I don't worry about them as much as I worry about somebody else and what somebody else might do to them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, they just sent me... Look what little bitches they are. Those little mother Wait, where is that with those canoes? Let me ask this guy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sir? After calling and calling and texting and texting and trying to find Kendall and Kylie, they send us some shady picture of them on a beach. And, yeah, I'm so happy that I know they're alive, but what kind of sick prank is this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, Kendall and Kylie sent us a picture of them at Nai Yang Beach, so our driver's taking us there right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank God. Okay, I'll text you as soon as we arrive. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Perfect. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nai Ya... What did Khloe say it was called? There's a pharmacy. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Nai-Nai Yang Beach or something? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bungalow. Yeah, we're on Nai Yang Beach. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, we are? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See that place right there? Let's just go look in there and ask them if they've seen a couple of bratty teenagers. Hello. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you work here? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're looking for my daughters-- two teenage girls, very tall. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Mm-hmm. I don't know. You can look... for inside. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This way? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes, this way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Would they be in a room? &gt;&gt; LEAH: No, they're probably... Wait, it's straight down. They're probably down at the beach. Let's walk down there and look. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think they're in the water? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I don't know, it's like a needle in a haystack. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could they be out in the water? &gt;&gt; LEAH: There's nobody in the water. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: This is bull &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I don't... I'm trying to think of where we would go next. I'm totally confused. The girls are clearly playing a game with us. And even though I know that they're somewhat safe, I still worry about my kids. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just hope they don't think this is funny. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I know that you're worried about your daughters, but we'll find them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Kendall and Kylie, like, ran off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's, look... Look, a Fantastic Sams. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, but they're, like, being annoying and sending us pictures of themselves all over town, and so we're, like, literally on a scavenger hunt looking for them. Look at this braid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What braid? &gt;&gt; KIM: You can get your hair braided. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I want to get my hair braided. Those are definitely the boats that the picture was by. They have to be around here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, this is definitely, like, the area. Let's just start walking. Kim, like, let's just look and compare the photo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, let me see what the boats look like in the pictures. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it's that long boat right here. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, there's a white boat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But what if some of the boats moved? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, this isn't it 'cause there's some greenery. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is not it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, look, it's that bush right there. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's not. Khloe, you are the worst investigator. I'm the queen bee of investigating. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, it's right there. They were here. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, they weren't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just can't believe these girls would do this. I mean, who do they think they are? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The thing is they get themselves so worked up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I wonder where they got that from? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't... Everything is not my fault. If somebody runs away from the house in the middle of the night, I can't control that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, okay, okay, let's just find them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We just better hope that they did this on purpose. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hold it! Chill, chill, chill, chill. Let's just find them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, could you imagine? At least they texted Khloe, and told her something. Could you imagine if we would've thought that they were taken in the middle of the night? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why did they text Khloe but not you? Ah, that's the question. The $64,000 question. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, because, I guess it's because I'm a horrible mother, because I'm a bad person. That's why. Bruce picking a fight with me is the last thing I need right now. You just want to say it, so say it. You think that this is my fault. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't say it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, where'd you say you saw that braided thing? Look. They're taunting us. &gt;&gt; KIM: I swear they're here. Right there! Right there! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like Brody is crushing on Kim. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you've had a crush since you were seven years old. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That was him and Kim. They kissed back in the day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's not... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You kissed Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kim, Kim! Where'd you say you saw that braided thing? Look. They're taunting us. &gt;&gt; KIM: I swear they're here. They are here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, it was over here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Right there! Right there! Right in front with the pink hat! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: That store! That store, yes! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe they're hiding in one of these hammocks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. Did you see those girls? &gt;&gt; CLERK 1: No. &gt;&gt; CLERK 2: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When were they here? &gt;&gt; CLERK 2: Morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In the morning? &gt;&gt; CLERK 2: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. There were here this morning. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, I'm calling Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, they were here. They sent us a picture. We're at Thai-Smile. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've never been here before, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Spa-and Wellnesscenter." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know where I am and I'm very upset. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you start cursing at me, I will start cursing back at you, so let's not play the curse game. 'Cause do you want to play that game? 'Cause guess who's better at it? We're in front of Bank Restaurant, Thai Food and Seafood. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just tell your driver. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think we're all on the same street. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Let's go this way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think we just have to go that way. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's busier this way, it's busier. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's got AC. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Okay. Where is the driver? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. Just shut the door. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, we want to go to a place where you could get your hair braided. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He doesn't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, hair braided? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just drive down the street. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, stop! Like, a little place where they braid hair? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He doesn't know, Kris. Shut the door and have him drive down the street. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's look at these stores and see. I've never seen so many massage and hair braiding places. How do they all stay in business? Wait, they sent another picture. Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right now? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, they're getting a massage right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you just with me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, it says massage right here. Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Oh, my God... &gt;&gt; KIM: They're here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall! Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're getting a massage. You look so cute. So cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're getting massages. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. As much as I want to be pissed at Kendall and Kylie, I'm relieved that I found them and in true Jenner form, they're getting massages. Where'd you guys go? And why wouldn't you take me with you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We just needed some alone time if we're being honest. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, that's ridiculous. Let's call Mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who is that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe. Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have them. We're with them. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have them?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, kill them for me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, praise God! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, kill them for me, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are you? I don't even know... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At the massage place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: At the massage place?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You'll see us. It's a small alley and we're walking in the middle of the alley. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, let's get out. Okay, all right. I just want to see them with my own two eyes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Up here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The massage place is back there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are they? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You little bastards. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall and Kylie, I have never been so mad or so happy to see someone in my entire life! Don't you ever scare the out of me like that again. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Chill. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I think your dad may actually kill you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so glad you're okay. I am so happy to find Kendall and Kylie, and even though I'm mad that they did this, they're safe. I'm also glad that they're in a much better mood than they were in last night. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you gonna explain yourself or what? Or was that supposed to be a joke? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why is this just about me? She was with me, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, but you're the oldest and supposed to be a lot more responsible. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Was this supposed to be just a joke? We had other things to do today. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I was very responsible. I took care of her. I could understand why my parents were a little upset, but Kylie and I were safe. We just needed a break from our parents and we were sending them pictures to reassure them. Maybe if my parents stopped fighting and enjoy Thailand, they might learn to like each other again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just need to be happy that they're okay, all right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you done? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, good. That's great. Oh, my God. Can you believe we found them in this place? &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, that could've been... &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...such a scary ending. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's get... let's get back to the next adventure, guys. Enough of that stuff. That wasn't fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look where we are, Kendall. On the other side of the world. How did we get here? And where are we going? Things have been pretty hectic up to now, so I'm thinking that maybe it'll be a great day because we can be out on the ocean on a boat relaxing and give everybody a chance to finally enjoy this vacation. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Khloe, you got one hell of a look going on right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why, thank you. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Kim, your bathing suit is so pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Brody, don't you like Kim's bathing suit? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, now that you're talking about my bathing suit, I have to stand up so there's no fat roll. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay, okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: it's pretty. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Isn't it cute? &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, it's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; LEAH: So cute. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Wow, Kim looks... yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait for me, chicken head. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Did you like Kim's bathing suit? Look how uncomfortable you are. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Kendall, you should be cautious. Just make sure you lock the doors and stuff whenever you change. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, Brandon, you know when I said I got a half-chub, it was a joke. It's, like, stop it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is he talking about a boner? &gt;&gt; BRODY: You don't... No... How do... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Now it gets serious. How do you know about a half-chub? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I just... Are you talking about, like, foreplay? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How do you know about foreplay? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yes, Brandon, thank you! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Is this something that Dad, Dad sat down and said, "It's a half-chub!" &gt;&gt; BRODY: "Yeah." &gt;&gt; BRANDON: "You know, it's something that Brody gets if he walks in on Kim." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, did that happen? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Come on! But let me be able to explain this, Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Recently? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Before-- stop this. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Today, like, on this trip? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Kendall, stop. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think it's hilarious that Brody walked in on Kim and got a half-chub. I like to know these things about my family. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I was kidding, I was kidding! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You were not kidding. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You know what? you guys. I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Love you, Brody. You know we're joking. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I want you to tell me this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRODY: 'Cause I don't know how to say this to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's so awkward, Kris, it's, like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I was taking an adventure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I didn't realize that I would open this one door and see Kim taking photos of herself in some white, like, full, like, wet... It was a see-through white... It was a, it was a little... Anyway. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A see-through outfit. She's doing a selfie book right now. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I joked, I joked about having a half-chub, totally joking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, now everybody is really hounding on me... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't get a half-chub if you don't get a boner. I feel like Brody is crushing on Kim. Look at how red he is. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, come on. Oh, come on! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you've had a crush since you were seven years old. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That was him and Kim. You're forgetting that. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's not true. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think so. &gt;&gt; BRODY: They kissed back in the day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's not... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You kissed Kim?! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yes, see? Thank you. It's on you now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop. &gt;&gt; BRODY: And he knows it's true. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You kissed her? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Look at him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My God! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Kris, pre-game, pre-game. You know about pre-game. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yup. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What is it? Tell me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that a? I... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Did she just go there? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Uh, by the way, you guys, I'm just starting to see the beauty of where we're going. Look at that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my! Wow! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, wake up! You're missing the whole thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Every place that we turn, everything is so beautiful-- the mountains, the caves, like, I cannot believe we're about to go and, like, canoe through all these beautiful caves. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's get in the boat, guys. Let's go, we're going ashore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Am I going to get so sunburned? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, you're gonna be in a cave. You won't get sunburned in a cave. Who have we got left-- Kim? Let's go! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look how pretty this is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I know, this is crazy. This is like Disneyland. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who's first? Brody, Kim. Why don't you guys go right there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why don't you slide up front? &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: So Brody can scoot in behind you. And watch out for the half-chub. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Ihate you guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris, why don't you and I go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are we ready? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, let's move it. You're getting in the front. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hold on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just get in the boat and go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Push it back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just doing my best. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The fact that my mom and Bruce are still fighting and they just cannot get it together... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just chill out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut theup, you idiots. I mean, they're ruining our entire trip for us. It's not fun anymore. And then... there's me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, why is Khloe all by herself? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey, what happened, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Youleft me, you It's not the first time I've been ditched for Kim, don't worry. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna get a fab tan line with this. I'm gonna have to go naked later. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, I'm so scared. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't be scared. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Look at this whole thing that's over top of us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, it's fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got a light, honey, if you need it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How cool is this, huh? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, it opens up. This is incredible! &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like Rob just needs to get it together. It's just, like, a cycle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's because you have to want it for yourself, and that's what frustrates me about you so badly. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm gonna get Kim back so bad. I'll be butt-naked. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I'm handing you the leaves and I'm leaving. No, I don't want to see that! No, no. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, it opens up. This is incredible! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And let there be light! &gt;&gt; KIM: This is insane. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I really feel like I'm in another world. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Jurassic Park. As much as I complain and kick and scream, at the end of the day, some of the things that Bruce wants us to do are once in a lifetime experiences. So I'm really grateful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We made it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, take a picture of Daddy and I. Hi, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This place is phenomenal and it's beautiful. I do wish my brother was here to see it, though. He's missing out on all of our family memories. I mean, it's sad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, did you guys like that? Hey, hey! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Brod. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? What are you guys doing? Like, what do you... I keep catching you, like... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: With Brody? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, what is going on? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, obviously, Brody walked in on you, right? Naked, and he came back and he told us-- we immediately just started messing with him, and we were like, "Oh, oh, did she turn you on?" You know, and he goes, "Well, I did get a half-chub." And he was joking, but ever since then, we've just been messing with him. So you should mess with him, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: Brandon wants me to get in on this whole teasing Brody thing. So I'm just gonna play along, just for fun. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey, Brody. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How you doing? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Great. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: You're so far. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm so far? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Really? I mean, we can hear each other, though... Am I really that far? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kind of. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Feels just like there's so much distant between you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim is crazy. The fact that she has the balls to do this. She has no shame in her game. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Brody, let's take a picture up here. Come on, I'll take a picture. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, we'll take a picture. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're doing slo-mo. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Come on. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, come on, guys. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Come on. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm notdoing that. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Come on, grab a towel. &gt;&gt; LEAH: It'll be funny. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, rea...? Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Come on, it'll be funny. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRODY:you guys. Nah, nah, nah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Is he upset? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No, he's not upset. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: He gets shy. We're obviously just messing around. I really wish he would have done that. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: So you're living in Rob's house now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: With Rob? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. It's a townhouse. I love it. Like, it's really cozy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Is he doing all right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I mean, he never leaves the house. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, ever. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You know, you could make yourself really depressed if you don't leave a house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: If anyone of us... you know, if we just decided, "Oh, I'm gonna stay in for weeks." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I mean, he's definitely very depressed. It's sad. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I just want him to get better. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. I feel like Rob just needs to get it together and, like, go away somewhere. I'm all about, like, being proactive. It's been over a year now that he's been like this. We've all tried to help him. It's just, like, a cycle. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That first step is probably the hardest step. You know, it's, like, saying, "Okay, I'm not gonna go do this." &gt;&gt; KIM: He's taken that first step a few times. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one will get help unless they want it on their own. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Has he? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. It's because he does it for everybody else. You have to want it for yourself. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And that's what frustrates me about you so badly. Sometimes you guys are just so close-minded that you don't think about what else they're going through. Like, he has to want... You can't, like, just be, like, "Oh, you just keep complaining about the same thing." &gt;&gt; KIM: No, the problem is... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not the way it works. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't even say that to him. The problem is, he spends hours a day with Mom on the phone talking about... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But if that's what he needs to do, that's what he needs to do. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...how his life is so miserable, but he won't do anything, and I'm just a little bit more of a tough love kind of person. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been so a part of Rob's world for the past few years, while Kim has been living her own life, and it's easy to say, just give someone tough love. It's so easy to say that, 'cause she's not with Rob all the time. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You okay, Khloe? Are you just tired? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm just tired of... everything. It's like, ay-ay-ay. , what a vacation. I just want to go home. Rob has said, like, you know, being in that house, it was so dark, and it made me do dark things. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, that's-that's an excuse. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Don't feel that guilt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one could make me not feel guilty. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Don't forget to fan yourself. She's here. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I feel really bad for Khloe. I think that everybody kind of like puts a lot of pressure on her and leans on her in a certain way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. We all thought, like, okay, Khloe is gonna move in with Rob, and we're gonna totally now have this eye on him. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: But she can't even help herself right now because she's so depressed over what's been going on. I think Khloe should take the time for herself to grieve and deal with her own problems, instead of have a full responsibility of other people. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: This whole Rob thing-- obviously, it's just too... it's too much... for her to deal with. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I want to talk to him and be, like, "Get your together, and let Khloe, like... Be a good brother and, like, help her." It's, like, you can't 'cause he has issues. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You know, I've watched this, you know, kind of from the sidelines, get worse and worse and worse, and it seems like it's gotten to the point where family and friends have to be unified, and they have to say, "Listen, we all agree that there's an issue here." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You're the one that needs love and support, and, unfortunately, at this time, Rob is dealing with some serious issues himself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He needs... he needs help. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRODY: He really needs help. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I'm... I get that, and I'm... I don't have an issue with that. I just have an issue with feeling, like, the guilt, but I get that. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Khloe, please, please don't ever feel that guilt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But even, like, Rob has said, like, you know, being in that house-- it was so dark, and it made me do dark things. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, that's a... That's an excuse. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That's an excuse. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it still gets to me, makes me feel bad. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know, but that's wrong, because you shouldn't feel bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Only Rob, Lamar and I know what, like, happened in the house, and what was going on, and... I mean, I definitely feel guilty, and I don't care what anyone says. My personality, in general-- I'm a nurturer. I want to protect everyone. And I was not there to protect Rob. I was not even there to protect myself. No one could make me not feel guilty. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's not your fault, Khlo, it's really not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. It just sucks. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know. It's... I'm sorry you feel that way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, thank you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm... I really am. I'm gonna get Kim back so bad. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Which one? Small, medium or large? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Those are... those are definitely big enough, okay? I mean, my God. Shewith me, I'll with her. I'm gonna be butt naked. She needs to see enough. It needs to be funny. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Believe me, she's seeing enough. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay, we can just cover it with... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Two, and try a third. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Geez. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Three. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's too many, Leah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: And then, fan yourself with the fourth one. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, that's kind of funny, actually. As she comes in, I'm gonna be like... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Brandon can't distract him forever, Brody. Let's go. &gt;&gt; BRODY: All right, I'm in. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: She's pretty cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: She sits with, like, her legs crossed. Let's sit like a lady, huh? Can Mom just have two bites? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Brody, come on. Hurry! &gt;&gt; BRODY: I think it's open. I just got to get butt-ass naked. &gt;&gt; KIM: Last bite! Can Mom have one more bite? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I'm handing you the leaves and leaving. No, I don't want to see that! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Come here. &gt;&gt; LEAH: No, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, we ate enough. See you later. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Take them. Take them. Ugh. Take this one. &gt;&gt; BRODY: And I got to go the whole... Hold up. Hold up. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Shh. Shut up. You got to lose your shirt. Don't forget to fan yourself. She's here. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is going on in my room? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can do whatever your heart desires, princess. Why don't you go take some more selfies? &gt;&gt; KIM: You're, like, a miserable person. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, no. She's here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey, Kim. Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is going on in my room? This is so gross. I do not want to see you. Brody is in my bed, like, naked with a leaf on him. I'm just, like, shocked. It's so disgusting. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, Kim, don't. Oh. Oh, No, that's bad. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Your thighs are so white, Brody. &gt;&gt; KIM: When he put his leg up, it looks like he's posing. I'm literally blackmailing you for... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay, okay, joke's over. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Okay, okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hopefully, this just puts an end to this really awkward game. That's the bed I sleep in. North, you could never go back in there again. &gt;&gt; BRODY: This is getting awkward. awkward? awkward. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, come on, Kim. Oh. North, I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Dude, leave. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You have a crazy uncle. &gt;&gt; KIM: Leave. Leave. Ew. Why did I turn around and look? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I'll get his clothes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, today was a good day, wouldn't you say? Now that my daughters are back safe and sound. I'm sure that'll never happen again, will it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, of course not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: In a strange city, strange country. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, don't even get me started. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I forgot that was today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your taking off and running around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you guys think you're invincible sometimes, and you're not. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think we forgot about love today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Forgot about love? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think we forgot about the love and family today. I think we were all very angry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I get what Kylie's saying, and she's right. Bruce and I have been at each other's throats for, I don't know, the entire time we've been here in Thailand. : Kendall and Kylie-- you know what I think they were upset about? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think they were actually upset because they didn't believe that we could really be close and still be in love and be friends. They are getting mixed signals from us. Bruce and I are still trying to figure out our relationship. It's had its ups and downs and I know Kendall and Kylie get really frustrated with us, but we're trying to figure it out ourselves. We want to remain really good friends and it's a process. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why did I have all these girls? It's like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...life's too complicated. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not... It shouldn't be that way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't it great? Aren't we fun? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why girls?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aren't we amazing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This restaurant's pretty... I'm not gonna lie. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, look, that is so cool. It literally smells so good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, can I just make a toast? So, here's to all of you guys and our family. And you know what I love about all of us is that no matter what happens, we always come together at the end of the day because there's a lot of love here. And I look forward to the next family vacation. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who knows where? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But, um, love you guys so much, and through thick and thin, we're always here for each other. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Cheers! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Peace and love. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, you guys, everybody back to the rooms. Get a good night's sleep. More activities going on tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, boy. Yay. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 12:15 is looking real good. 12:15 is looking real good. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What's 12:15? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A flight I have on hold to get the freak out of here. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. I'm waiting for my travel agent. &gt;&gt; KIM: The fact that Khloe is trying to make all of these changes to get home earlier is really ridiculous. She's going to be traveling alone and pay a ton of money to change her ticket. And all for what? It just doesn't make sense. What's the point of coming all the way out here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you can do whatever your heart desires, princess. I'm not ruining anything for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not for me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you go take some more selfies? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm doing it for Kanye, someone that I love. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One day I'll be so lucky. One day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, one day. You want to get home to your 50 rappers that you're dating. You're, like, a miserable person. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am. &gt;&gt; KIM: You really are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm a miserable person that takes wonderful selfies all day long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen. I almost punched Kim in her face. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dude, I almost punched her for you, but I didn't want to get into it. I was about to be like, "Uh, are you kidding?" But then I was... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That went, that got real real fast. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So real. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you believe she said that? Kim goes back to, like, name-calling and calling me this and that and whatever, dude. Call me whatever you want. But I'm not a miserable person. I might be going through some miserableright now, but calling me names or whatever, it's not gonna make anything better. And again, validating why I want to go home. I just need to go home. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Tomorrow morning will work out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And if not, then what? I have to leave with the family? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to sit on that plane with Kim again? What if he kill each other? Her and thatselfie book. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's been the most draining trip I've ever been on. I'm thinking about whether or not I should go home. I don't really know what I'm gonna do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't this a great color? It matches your nails. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kind of. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're really cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you talked to Khloe this morning? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: She kind of wants to go home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She wanted to go home last night in the middle of the night. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so bizarre. I just get so frustrated. Whatever you want to do, it's vacation, but just don't sit and be miserable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like she gets anxiety with the whole Rob situation when she's away. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think she feels anxious because he's home alone by himself, and so maybe she feels like she needs to jump on a plane and just be in the motion of trying to get back home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, he's not home alone. He's also 27 years old. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't see what the point is. She doesn't need to help everyone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do the same thing. I want to fix Rob and sometimes you just can't. I have not not cried myself to sleep in so long, I don't know even know what that's like. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I go to bed every night worried about everybody. You know? And I'm sure Khloe's doing the same thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: God, remind me to never have, like, 50 kids. Everyone has, like, such a huge life-altering drama every single day of the week. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, and you know what it makes me appreciate? It makes me appreciate when life is good and I can lay my head down on the pillow and go to sleep and close my eyes and go, "Okay, let's go down the list-- Kourtney's great, Kim's great, Khloe's great, Rob's great, Kendall's great, Kylie's great." : It's, like, the worst feeling in the world when one of your kids doesn't, isn't in a good place. And I think about it all the time. You don't think it's torture for me to be here in Thailand and have him at home? I know how Khloe feels. I can't control someone else's behavior and I've got to learn how to deal with that. I feel sometimes like the weight of the world is coming down 'cause I'm trying to micromanage everything and that's how Khloe feels. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I think Khloe feels the same way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe feels responsible for him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seeing my mom cry over Rob, honestly, it's, like, heartbreaking. It just makes me really think, like, how hard this must be for Khloe. I mean, they just have this special bond, they always have. &gt;&gt; MAN: There they are together. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're the closest in age out of all the siblings, and they're, like, best friends. When you're so close to someone, it's shocking when they just go through so many changes. It must be really hard for Khloe to witness this all. I don't want her to feel, you know, like, this just huge responsibility. It's not her fault. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No one blames her for any of this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, not at all. And I think it's just so unhealthy going from Lamar and having to deal with all of that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And this. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then now... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's huge. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...moving in with someone else when this should be her, like, grieving time by herself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. It's a lot. She's going through a lot. &gt;&gt; KIM: She needs to be selfish and she needs to, you know, not take responsibility for everyone else and it's okay to grieve and do her own thing. And it's gonna be unhealthy for her if she wants to try and save Rob. Like, she just has to, like, save herself. Hello! We've got some gifts for you. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... Oh, how cool! How old are you? &gt;&gt; GIRL: 12. &gt;&gt; KIM: When you go to a place like this and you just see so many amazing kids, you think, like, what more can I do? It just breaks my heart for these kids. It was just so sad. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's sad. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That guy just touched my ass. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Who? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Right there. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You just touched my sister?!
