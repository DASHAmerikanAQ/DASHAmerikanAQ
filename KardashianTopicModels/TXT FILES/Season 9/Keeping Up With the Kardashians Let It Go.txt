- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ow! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Get off of me! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're on me first of all. You look pretty. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Pretty ugly! No! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sacre bleu! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Aah, sacre. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're good? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're abusive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got body makeup all over you. That's what you get! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Fake bitch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously, my vagina is eating this. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Kourtney! I am still in the middle of dealing with a lot of the logistics of Lamar and I. My jeans keep going up my vagina! I'm trying to keep on such a brave face, and I have everything handled and together. Which I really don't. Look at you, Paula Abdul! I really try to just ignore what's happening and smile and act like just, "Ah, everything's good and happy." Like, I don't know what the is going on. I've never seen you jump. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause I've always been too fat to jump. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shoes or no shoes? &gt;&gt; BOTH: No shoes! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine. You guys lost me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Someone wants to buy my house with all of my furniture. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No way! &gt;&gt; KIM: They do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That doesn't scare you guys? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, that's what I did. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I say get rid of it and move on. &gt;&gt; KIM: I did that, it was, like, a fresh start. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know where I'm gonna move and I don't know what I want to do. My motto? I don't know. I am not ready for this much change. I'm confused out of my mind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Take off my boot. Oh, my God, my boot, not my foot! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oopsy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, kiddo. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just having a little drink before my car picks me up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna go to join, um, Diddy. He's doing that... Rick Ross is doing a little concert this afternoon. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your boobs, honestly, they get bigger. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I just lifted this bra up. It's like night and day. I need to have my bras, my boobs sitting up at this... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you do. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...level at all times. They were, like, down to here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's life changing. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Life changing," but it gives me back fat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Got to pick... choose your battles. That's what I learned in my life. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. So, why do you care to go to this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I was invited, and I think it would be fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: When are you gonna act your own age? This, like, rap crew, like, Rick Ross and Diddy? Do you think this is, like, your crowd? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know a thing or two about rap music. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who is "the boss"? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Me. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who, I'm not the boss? &gt;&gt; KIM: Ricky Rozay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: See? You don't even know the slang. You're going to go meet people, and you don't know who the boss... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ricky-Ricky Rozay is Rick Ross. &gt;&gt; KIM: There you go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See? &gt;&gt; KIM: Or the boss. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wasn't born... He's the boss. I wasn't born yesterday. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want you to just act, like, age appropriate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In my mind, age is just a number. I think that you are only as old as you feel. And the fact that I'm keeping up with these girls... I'm pretty excited. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know you're having fun, but you're not 30. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not trying to be 30. I appreciate the little pep talk, but you're Debbie Downer, and I can't handle people that have this negative energy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'd rather be a Debbie Downer than a Debbie Desperado. There's a difference. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, there is and I... &gt;&gt; KIM: We're both Debbie. You're just, we're different Debs. Go have fun. Go get ready for your car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And you're still asking me why I drink? Seriously. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I don't like all these photographers on the property. How is that, like, legal? It's so crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I almost killed them! Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, we're calling the police, it's illegal that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, likeLamar all the time. Benny Joon. &gt;&gt; BENNY: How are you? Sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll calm down now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Take it easy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I just went in here and just started cursing, I do apologize... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, no. You're already stressed out about a lot of things going on in your life's changing, and then these idiots don't help. You need to get away. I'm getting away actually. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going back to that Miraval spa that I went to before. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop, no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I went with Kourtney not long ago. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But now I'm going again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The trust exercises? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, she wasn't so trusting. But I'm going back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: With who-- Kourt? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going with Chris Reda. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Because they really want you to get, like, emotional there at Miraval, and they want you to, you know, show your emotion, where Kourt doesn't, so I think they get offended by her there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, Scott has been through a lot lately. His mother passed away, and a month later, his father passed away. So understandably, Scott wants to go somewhere alone, and think about his life and process his thoughts. I think a man-cation is good for you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: In a man spa. It's really nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you concerned about Penelope being exactly like Kourt? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like, never speaking her mind and never talking? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, 'cause Kourtney speaks her mind, but P is like, when you're like, "Kourtney!" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nothing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "I got you a new car!" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to get her a new car! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, get excited for that reaction. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's the only thing. I told Benny, I was like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you gonna get her? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll get her, like, a, like, a sports car, something, like, small and cute, fun, like she doesn't always have to be like, Miss Mommy, like, in, like, an SUV. You know, I think more than ever, I've started to realize how important the people you have around you really are. And I don't think you really know until, I guess, you lose somebody and, you know, I just wanted to kind of show Kourt how much I do appreciate her. Getting her a new car is something fun. I know that would mean the world to me. I feel like this car could be cute for Kourt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is too big for Kourtney. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Too big? &gt;&gt; BENNY: Big? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like Kourtney is so small, she needs, like, a Mini Cooper. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She won't get excited if I buy her a Ferrari, what's she gonna do for the Mini? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hey, gorge! Look at the sequin queen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. It's embroidery actually. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hoochie hoops, too? The bigger the hoop, the bigger the ho. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get some bigger ones. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look how big mine are! &gt;&gt; KIM: Love the new hair dye in there. Brings out the sparkle in your eye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It does? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Show us this little outfit you have on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's pretty fance. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Leggings? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, they're like... Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you are looking so hot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think she's gonna do a lap dance. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That bod is almost back, it's basically back. You guys are, like, having a MILF-off. &gt;&gt; KIM: A MILF-off? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A MILF-off. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe calling me a MILF is the ultimate compliment. I mean, who wouldn't want to be? I think that any time anyone has a baby, they just do not feel good about themselves for months and months. So, now that I finally lost my weight, why not flaunt it? At least while you got it. What a fab word. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A MILF-off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's a MILF-off? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom I'd like to contest. You guys are, like, trying to outshine the next. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom and I have always had this, like, funny, weird, cute competition, where it's just like I posted this bikini pic of me, and then she goes and posts a bikini pic of herself, and it's like, "I get it, but come on." &gt;&gt; KRIS: That looks beautiful. I'm gonna take a picture of it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Instagramming photos of food isn't sexy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just lost your MILF status. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? What's your all-time favorite restaurant? &gt;&gt; KIM: In the world or in the Valley? &gt;&gt; KRIS: In the world. &gt;&gt; KIM: The world is this one called Ferdi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, "Ferdee"? &gt;&gt; KIM: Ferdi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's "Ferdee" in Paris. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've never been to Paris. Do I like French food? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys have been on these diets way too long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If someone's in escrow, can you, like, say never mind? Can I say, "Oop, psych!" &gt;&gt; KIM: Kind of, but you might get a lawsuit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I've agreed to sell my house. Now this buyer, you know, presented a really fast escrow, which in anyone else's world is phenomenal and great. But it's scary! I'm exhausted right now. Hence, my ensemble. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you look so glamorous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, I'm saving money. By wearing Lamar's sweatsuit. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's okay. You should keep a few. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have all of his clothes. I haven't moved one thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you gonna do with his clothes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Put them in storage. To go through my really crazy life change-- I can't even say the words, I'm gonna say "life change." I just don't want to leave anymore. I'm over it. I don't want to pack up all this stuff. It's too stressful. I'm just not ready to let my house go. I'm just, I don't know. It's, like, my final thing that I get to hold onto. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really think you should, like, start packing. You don't have that much longer. I'll totally help you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to start packing right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, Khlo, but you kind of have to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I don't. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, when do you plan on doing it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you here just to piss me off? Like, you're gonna put me in a bad mood. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but you have to move out. Like, people are moving in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wish I had Lamar here to say, like, "Hey, like, do... like, what furniture do you want or what furniture..." Like, you're supposed to go through this as, like, a team. But I guess it's the first step in realizing that I'm not on a team anymore. I could figure it out. &gt;&gt; KIM: The day of. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to move any more. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just wanted to know if you wanted help. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't deal with this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey... So you're going to a pole dancing class and you guys didn't invite me? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know my mom wants to be cool, but it's just so awkward. Mom, you're not coming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I am so coming. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It can only get better from here. I should wrap up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, Scott, have you talked to Kourtney about this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just feel like it's easier to talk to Khloe. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MASON: Help! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, Beauford. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's shakin'? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was just looking over these Dash spaces that Tom sent me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, how are they? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're good, they're just expensive. By the way, I started getting a large tea like that and it's life-changing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what changes your life? Moving from a medium to a large in an iced tea? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But still with the one-inch sandwiches for lunch? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. And then a large tea and you're on fuegs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look, I want to show you something that I was excited about. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have to go somewhere? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes, it's in the "garridge." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look how cute kitty is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you ready for your big surprise? I got you a new little vehicle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you excited? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but I have kids with car seats. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So there's no excitement. You know, I wasn't expecting too much excitement out of Kourtney, because she never shows much emotion to anything, but I was expecting a little bit more than this. I mean, it's a car! An expensive one. You want to get in? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, you really get nothing out of her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How do I... get in here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know if she's mad or happy about this. You know, I just wanted to get her some kind of fun gift. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh-huh, but what if I'm by myself? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You'll figure it out. Hopefully, she understands that this is just a little piece of how much I love and respect her. All right, see you later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott! You just leave me here? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So let's learn how to twerk. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Kim, I've got a video for you to watch. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Drop down and stick your booty out. &gt;&gt; LARSA: This is gonna be educational. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Don't be afraid to get low. Let's go! Get with the beat. Bend the knees... &gt;&gt; LARSA: I think you're better than me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love when Larsa's in town. She's one of my best friends and there's just something about her energy. No matter what could be going on around us, I know we're just gonna always have a good time. I think I just need... I just need, like, a drink first. She wants to go to this pole dancing class. I'm gonna try to have a good time, but dancing is just not my thing. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Does Kanye know we're doing this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I told him. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Is he proud of you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; LARSA: I'm sure he'd love for you to learn how to twerk. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but he knows I'm really not like that. He's not, like, "Babe, dance for me." I would die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; LARSA: We're getting ready to take a-a twerking class, or a pole dance. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you're going to a pole dancing class and you guys didn't invite me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why would we invite... no offense, but my mom? That's kind of weird. &gt;&gt; LARSA: You should totally come. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you guys leaving right now? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we're leaving right now. Chug-a-lug. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, well, wait. I just need to change. I can't wear this. &gt;&gt; LARSA: No, you look great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you're not coming with us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, give me two seconds. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom! &gt;&gt; LARSA: Great! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so coming. Give me five minutes! I'm gonna change my clothes! &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you inviting her? &gt;&gt; LARSA: 'Cause I love her and I never see her. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but that's, like, so embarrassing. I don't want to, like, stripper dance with my mom. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Your mom is so gangster. She's gonna totally teach us how to down... break it down. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think my mom is so funny and amazing, but my mom literally copies everything I do. When it's like this weird competition thing, it's so embarrassing. Oh, Mom, come on. This is a workout. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; LARSA: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at this. This is ri... Mom, it's a workout. &gt;&gt; LARSA: You are so fab. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have another one. Do you want to borrow it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that a leotard? For real? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. It's kind of fun for me to show my girls that you can do anything at any age. Don't make fun of me. &gt;&gt; LARSA: No, you look hot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, what am I supposed to do, sit home and knit? &gt;&gt; LARSA: Kris, I want to slap your ass, it looks so good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Spank me, baby. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: You weren't at Kim's engagement. &gt;&gt; LARSA: No, I missed it 'cause I was sick and I didn't know she was getting engaged. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, 'cause we invited you. &gt;&gt; LARSA: I know. I didn't know she was getting engaged. Had I known, I would've came with the flu, dying, and like... crawled. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but you won't, hopefully, miss anything else. &gt;&gt; LARSA: No, I'm... the wedding? I am there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; LARSA: How's Khloe doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's... I mean, she's not great, but she's okay. And I know she's really sad and scared. Her life is on... is in limbo, because it's been years now. &gt;&gt; LARSA: But at the same time, she's so young that it's not fair for her, either, to be put... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LARSA: You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I know. &gt;&gt; LARSA: To ride this roller coaster that may never come to an end. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's right. How is Scottie? &gt;&gt; LARSA: He's good. He's so cute. We have sex, like, three times a night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every night? &gt;&gt; LARSA: Every night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a lot of sex. &gt;&gt; LARSA: That's a lot of sex. Have you ever heard of that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so jealous. I... &gt;&gt; LARSA: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'd die for you. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. I'm so, like, impressed. &gt;&gt; LARSA: So you weren't in that situation? &gt;&gt; KIM: Come on. I really cannot deal with these conversations... &gt;&gt; LARSA: Sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...in front of my mom. Like, I just can't. &gt;&gt; LARSA: I'm sorry, but your mom is like, 25. Come to grips with that. Your mom is cool as hell. Like, I want to hang out with her every day. Get ready, bitches. Pretend you're strippers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's not a far stretch for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, a comment like that is not a good look. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MARRA: Yes! Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shoulders back. Oh, yeah. Yes! Yes! &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom's just going for it. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Yow. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: There are a few things we need to finish up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like we have other stuff to pack first. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Well, tell me where you want to start. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not ready to let go of those photos! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; LARSA: You ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom invites herself to do a stripper pole class. : It is so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; MARRA: We are going to find our places to our mats. First, we're just gonna take... ...a little breath. Let your chest slowly undulate. &gt;&gt; KIM: Slowly what? &gt;&gt; MARRA: Undulate. Like a wave going whoosh. We are celebrating the beauty of the feminine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Youris in her face. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Do you want me to break it down. &gt;&gt; KIM: Fix your underwear. : I'm just kidding! &gt;&gt; MARRA: Feel free to let your hands explore. So I always say, if anyone else gets to touch, so can I. Keep it so that you've always got your breasts leading the way, your shoulders back and your booty back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, your shoulders back! &gt;&gt; MARRA: Great, yes! That's what we're talking about. A little bounce. That's so hot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Embarrassing. &gt;&gt; MARRA: So let your head come around your right shoulder. Yes! Oh, my God, Kim, gorgeous! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: This is so uncomfortable. I can't even hardly dance in front of anyone. You know, I would get so shy and embarrassed. And my mom is just going for it. &gt;&gt; MARRA: You're gonna drag your hands around your body. &gt;&gt; KIM: My friends love it. They love to hang out with her, they love her energy. So I'm just gonna go with it and try and have a good time. &gt;&gt; MARRA: Do we want to learn some pole? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Yow! &gt;&gt; MARRA: Even as you're walking towards it, let it be this thing that you're moving up towards. Yummy. Let your head be a part of it. &gt;&gt; BLAC: That's hot, yeah. &gt;&gt; MARRA: Okay, Kim, it's all yours. So just enjoy it, is my encouragement. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MARRA: Pushing your butt back. Oh, my God... There she goes. And lift your feet again. There she goes! ♫ ♫ You're gonna grip behind your knee. &gt;&gt; LARSA: Like this. &gt;&gt; MARRA: Keep your knees to your butt. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I need a longer weave for this. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MARRA: And slowly move your booty. All the way up. Oh, nice! Gorgeous. Hello! That's so gorgeous, yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have to give my mom an "A" for effort, but she should honestly just stick to her Jane Fonda workout VHSs. &gt;&gt; MARRA: Oh, my God! Kris! Oh, my God! Okay! &gt;&gt; KIM: Now you are ready for the single life. I do not feel bad for you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you like these or no? I have them in patent leather and I was gonna... just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never bought any of them. They're just... I just feel like every person has them. &gt;&gt; KIM: But is the patent just kind of fun and ghetto? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who are you, and what have you done with Kim? You're trying to be me now? And Scott keeps texting me and said if we could talk. Like you're gonna be Greased Lightning? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, L.D. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Khlo. Thanks for giving me a ring. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'm all right. I'm just like... I felt like it was good to get away and go to the spa, but now that I'm, like, all alone, I'm just, like, anxious and lonely and wish I was just at home. You know? I feel like it's been such a bad year for everybody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This has been a year for everyone in this family. I don't get it. I don't get what's happening. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like somebody put a spell on us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Except Kim is having a good year. It's Kim's, like, one good year. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. She's on fire. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, Scott, have you talked to Kourtney about this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just feel like it's easier to talk to Khloe, sometimes, than anybody else, 'cause she kind of just understands more than anybody else. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really want to talk to Kourt. Like, I feel like she needs to know, like, seriously, how you feel. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's all right. I gotta deal with that. Everybody goes through a tough time. I figure it could only get better from here. Luckily. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: True. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I've hit rock bottom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will say, though, Scott, you're handling it much better than I thought you were gonna handle it. I mean, it took me three years to, like, be... just be able to talk about my dad and I spiraled and was, like, a wild banshee. It was crazy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Definitely. You know, I wake up some days and I'm just like... I just don't get how it all happened so quick. It was so nice knowing that there was, like, kind of a stable ground in New York. If I ever needed to go see them, I could stay at their house and then it was like all gone and... I feel like New York has nothing to do with me anymore. And I just don't know if I should, like, keep their house. I... I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, all of that you don't have to decide now. Like, it takes time and you... when you're ready, do it. I hate when people try to tell you, "Oh, you shouldn't be upset." Feel however you want to feel. You're entitled to it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, that's true. Well, I'm gonna try to go to bed and hopefully wake up tomorrow with, like, a better day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, bye, L.D. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is so sad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How sad. Kourtney doesn't mean any harm, but I really think, especially with everything he's going through, like, I think she should turn it up a notch. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's a horrible shot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're too short. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: One more, one more. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi. What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm doing an Instagram. "Half of us hoes be up, and half of us hoes be down." &gt;&gt; MALIKA: We have a few things we need to finish up. Like maybe I can start on the man room? And maybe help... tell me what you want to keep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I need to talk to Lamar about the man room. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: 'Cause we still need to pack it, either way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have ten days until I have to be gone. Leave mealone. Technically, Lamar and I are not divorced yet, so as of now, I'm just taking everything that's his and I'm saving it, because I'm not gonna do anything without speaking to him or getting his consent. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Maybe pack it and we can label the boxes and then you can still find out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I feel like we have other stuff to pack first. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: The kitchen is basically done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It looks basically done. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It does. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at all these ashtrays. Wow, look at this... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but whose ashtrays are those? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar's. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you divide them up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not... we're not fighting over ashtrays. They're clear glass ashtrays. If he... I'm gonna give him some and I'll have some. I don't smoke. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: True. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Well, tell me where you want to start. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All my picture frames in my bedroom, we have to wrap. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, okay. I didn't know you knew what you were gonna do with those yet. I don't know what to touch, what to wrap... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, what do you think I'm gonna do with those? Do you think I'm gonna leave them here? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I don't know. We-we haven't discussed them. That's it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone is pushing me. Push, push, push. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Malika's here to help. Let's pack it all up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I'm not ready to let go of those photos! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you don't have to. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: But no one says you have to let go of them. We can just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I don't want them out of the frames yet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're just... we're just suggesting it. Do you want them out so when you move there you don't open then there... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't even want to move and guess who made me move? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All you people. I don't want to move. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know that Khloe's been going through a lot and personally, I think just being in her house is such a reminder of so many dark moments, the best thing for her would be to move on and have a happier place, with no bad memories. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You've got to help me with her. I just don't know how to help if she won't tell me. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Oh, cute, you're naked! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KIM: That is so embarrassing. Why are yourout? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to be more emotional? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm emotional. I don't know what you guys are talking about. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're not, really. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am an emotional person. ♫ ♫ Buenos días. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you cut your shirt like that yourself? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Is it disgusting? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye and I were just going through our wedding list. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How many people are you inviting? &gt;&gt; KIM: Each 100, but we're not gonna have more than 150. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is making me tear up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm, no, it's the garlic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was gonna say, there's no way. 'Cause you're emotional-less. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Emotionless"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Emotionless. Mm... do you want to be more emotional? Or are you fine? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm emotional. I don't know what you guys are talking about. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're not, really. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am an emotional person. I cry at commercials, I cry in movies... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you don't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, I do. But what do you want me to be emotional about? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know how you feel about Scott being so sad? &gt;&gt; KIM: How is he doing with, like, his parents? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm... not good. &gt;&gt; KIM: But what do you mean by "not good"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, he's just, like, really anxious every morning. It was like... even yesterday, when I went to Khloe's for two hours, he was like, "Please come back with the kids. I'm super depressed." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Question. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like... Scott being sad and anxious every morning, like how does it make you feel? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, it makes me feel... helpless. Because there's not much I can do. I know that my sisters are hinting that I need to be more emotional when it comes to Scott and you know, this topic did actually come up when Scott and I were together at Miraval. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: You learned, in your family, to just play it cool. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She is kind of a blocked-off person. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: You might even have a hard time accessing your feelings, 'cause you don't know what they are, because you have avoided them for so long. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not really in touch with my feelings, so I definitely want to work on it. But I just really haven't had the time to do it yet. Okay. I'm going home. I am so tired today. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you use emojis? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She hates emojis. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I love emojis. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You told me... &gt;&gt; KIM: You do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, it's a little dramatic for just an everyday text message situation. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ARIAS: So I'm gonna have you standing right over here, using this palm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Oh, cute, you're naked! &gt;&gt; ARIAS: There you go. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Totally normal in the garden. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love it. &gt;&gt; ARIAS: We'll get a test shot real quick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yep. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Twist it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not a pretzel, guys. &gt;&gt; ARIAS: You look good, though, whatever you're doing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not a pretzel, but you can dip me in some sugar. &gt;&gt; ARIAS: There you go. Nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Doing a personal photo shoot once in a while is a lot of fun. &gt;&gt; ARIAS: Are you ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ARIAS: Nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's amazing to do things that are a little on the sexier, edgy side and show my girls that when you're in your 50s, you don't curl up and disappear. You can be vibrant and sexy and feel good about yourself at any age. &gt;&gt; ARIAS: Ooh, I love that, right there. There you go. And turn to the side? Yep. Right there. Come up, give us a nice smile. Right there. Beautiful, Kris. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: O.M.G. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? Is this okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean, what am I... what does it look like I'm doing? I'm doing a photo shoot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are your out? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so embarrassing for your life and your soul. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm done with you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys don't make me feel really great, and it hurts my feelings. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: You're always thinking about something else. If simply you can just be there... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm literally on the verge of a nervous breakdown. &gt;&gt; ARIAS: Give us a nice smile. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean, what am I... what does it look like I'm doing? I'm doing a photo shoot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are your out? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so embarrassing for your life and your soul. It's just so bizarre. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yourlook good. That's... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't make that face, that's what you want people to say. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You obviously aren't asking someone to, like, say your eyes look good. You obviously are saying, "Oh, is it hot or cold today?" &gt;&gt; KIM: This is so bizarre. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so weird! &gt;&gt; ARIAS: Now let's take a few more shots. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't listen to this peanut gallery. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ARIAS: Love the eyes right there. Nice, Kris. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, that is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's a full-on porn. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Getting out, I just need a towel, please. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is happening?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is your vagina out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't even have underwear on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so gross. My eyes, my eyes, my eyes... &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Should we get her totally naked? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you kidding? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it's just... not every day you get to see this kind of stuff. Vagina out, ass out, out... totally normal. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's actually inspiring me to bank so many selfies. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what? I'll just wait and see what you guys look like when you're in your 50s. I'm so tired of you making fun of me. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just a little shocking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm done with you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Vagina out in the pool is just... a shocker. It's like a yeast infection ready to happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's gross. You need to warn your kids. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but I feel bad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you feel bad about? &gt;&gt; KIM: That, like, we made her feel uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sorry, you have to admit if you came out and you saw your mom in a pool, out, you're not gonna be like, "What theare you doing?" &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you annoyed with us? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean... sometimes you guys don't make me feel really great and it hurts my feelings, that's all. You know? And I think that you guys can do anything you want, whenever you want, and I'm always... I would support anything you guys do, whether I... &gt;&gt; KIM: We totally support you. I think it was just, like, we weren't expecting it, so it was just odd to walk into. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just wanted to show you that I... you know, still feel good about myself. At any age, you can look fantastic. It doesn't matter if I'm a grandmother or not. &gt;&gt; KIM: All power to you. Any MILF-ness that I have, I've gotten from you. I love how my mom is so secure with who she is, so I feel bad for being kind of hard on my mom. I mean, I would so much rather just play together instead of compete with each other. And I only wish that, at her age, I would be that, you know, confident with myself. She actually does teach me that true fabulousness comes from within. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, next time, maybe we can do a photo shoot together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, now you've taken it a little too far. But I support your shoots. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. Hi. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks for coming. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Yes, no problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Everyone feels like I'm not really in touch with my feelings and I just don't want to have problems because of it in the future. So I definitely want to get to the root of the problem. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: The kind of work that I do, I always work from the energy. And people comes to me sometime to find their life purpose. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Sometimes they want to heal some wounds. They want to unleash some blocks. Sometimes they're just curious and they come to see me and they don't really know why they come to see me, so it's... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In general, like, you know, my family and stuff, they'll say that I'm not very emotional or expressive. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: So is that something you want to be more connected with, your emotions? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Scott, both of his parents just passed away... &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Mm... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...within, like, two months of each other, so he's really, um, depressed. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Mm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And so I feel, like, a responsibility, too, with him. And he talks to me about it all the time, but I feel, like, helpless in a way, too, 'cause there's... It's like something that just time heals, I think. Um... &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Yeah, but it's interesting to say, "I feel I have a responsibility here." Everything you go on a job, on a duty, you know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: You put your hat on. Oh, Scott, you know, he's experiencing some pain and there's a part of his life... I need to know what to do, what to say and how to help. That's when you shut down. So it's not that you don't have emotion, you have too much of a brain that's sticking you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Or like... yeah, I'm thinking... &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...while he's, like, talking about everything, but I don't say what is... what I'm thinking, too. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: So you can appear to be cold... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: ...which is not who you are at all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: You have a lot of depth. More than what you think. If, simply, you can just be there. Even saying, "I have no idea what to do, but I feel your pain." That will be the best gift ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, I feel like I'm literally on the verge of a nervous breakdown, just because, that, I'm so stressed out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kokes. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are here to help you pack. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to show you how I like things. That's not how I want them done. Mom, &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like I'm literally on the verge of a nervous breakdown. ...that, I'm so stressed out. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Okay, when you feel under a nervous breakdown, do you talk, do you shut down? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've been feeling like this for, like... like, a few weeks, 'cause I'm just so busy that I don't get a second to, like, think... Or, I don't... really don't get time alone, ever. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have two kids, I have their dad, and then, like, I'm being pulled in a million different directions... &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Yes, yes, uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...at all times, so I feel like when I have a second alone, like, just to, like, digest, like, how am I feeling or what's happening, like, then I've just, like... explode, you know? &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. You have a lot of responsibilities-- you have had that all your life. There is a part of you that's always on alert, always kind of vigilant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: It's like you always-- even if you're here and you can looks, like, relax... and, you know, you're always thinking about something else. Either... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I feel like lately it's been more so. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's stressing me out. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Your mind, "I have to do this, how to do that." It doesn't stop. I wish you can truly rely on more people. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Deeply, you don't really rely on other people. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. I don't realize that I'm not being emotional, because as far as I can remember, this is just me. Since I was the oldest and I had to take a little bit more responsibility, I'm more, like, in charge. I need to do it myself. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: You know, when I visualize you, you're like simplicity, other things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: And it's so funny, because there are parts of your life that are not really simple or that just always on the go, on the run and so forth. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: But your essence is very simple in a beautiful way. And so my wish for you is, like, or a regular basis, you find time for just quietness and space, because that's what you love the most. There is a part of you that is really playful and funny and could be goofy... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: ...that is not out enough. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Does it make sense? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, it does. It's not that I don't have emotions, it's just lately I've been so wrapped up with the kids and Scott that I just haven't been in touch with my lighter, more fun side. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're jumping in the pool. No, not funny. Give it to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Send her home! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, did you just feel that? I just don't really have time alone to myself where I sit and relax, and reflect on what's been going on. I really need to work on finding a natural balance so I can enjoy these moments when they happen. Well, thank you. This was great. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: Yeah! Thank you for being open. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; TEJPAL: You're welcome. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: You got it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, wait, wait. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are they that heavy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't worry, I got the boxes. &gt;&gt; KIM: You sound like you're struggling there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I hope that popcorn stuff isn't too heavy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You used to be able to lift the side of a house. Kokes? &gt;&gt; KRIS AND BRUCE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? What are you guys doing here? &gt;&gt; KIM: We are here to help you pack as a family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a packing party. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I come for the brute force. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Arnold Schwarzenegger? &gt;&gt; KIM: He could hardly lift the box, so don't let that fool you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give us something to do. We're gonna help you pack this place up. &gt;&gt; KIM: We all just thought we'd pack as a family, we'd get it done, we'd help you. I think we all know that Khloe's having a really hard time moving on. Everything was fine and great, and now she is going through a really hard time. Hopefully with the support of all of us here, she'll feel encouraged to let us pack up with her and help her with whatever she needs. This is taking me back to my eBay days. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I'm gonna go start this other room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I... No. I have to show you how I like things. Or else you guys could really get out of my house if you're not gonna listen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I'm listening. What if I do... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not how I want them done. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're here to help. Relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I show you what this might look like? Because it's more compact. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I have an OCD problem, and if it's not done my way, I get major anxiety. I know they mean well, but everyone's just throwing stuff into boxes and they're... Like, I don't know what's going where... Like, it's freaking me out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo, do you still want all these cigars and stuff? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me try it, and if you don't like it, I'll do it all over again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you need some boxes over there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, please. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What size boxes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Please, you're stressing me out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: More boxes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone, get out of my house! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is this down here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause they're dirty! Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You, first of all... &gt;&gt; KRIS:! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't do that. You've got to tape it flat. You're gonna give me major anxiety. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo, can you get rid of all of these or do they... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Those are Lamar's! &gt;&gt; KIM: Lamar's not coming back to get them. I hate to break it to you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo, can you get rid of all of these or do they... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Those are Lamar's! &gt;&gt; KIM: Lamar's not coming back to get them. I hate to break it to you. I think it's obvious that it's not really the things that Khloe's worried about and how they're packed up and... It's not all those little things. This has to do with Lamar and her feeling like getting rid of this house is having Lamar slip further away from her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is mildew. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't want anything mildew. Come on, you're procrastinating. Put it in here. Move. You're sitting there. Khloe, seriously, you're pissing me off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't say anything. I really think it's sweet that, you know, Kim brought everyone over to help me pack, and I know everyone is trying and they want to help out as much as they can, but I can't put everything behind me. It's still very much current and, you know, that's okay for now and people just are gonna have to deal with it. It's my life, my drama and that's just the way it is. You guys are stressing me out. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't want that basket though? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get out of my house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. Keep it moving. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, bug. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What-what was going on here exactly? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She was that girl I was telling you from Miraval. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She is, like, an expert at, like, reading energy. She said, like, I'm not connected to my emotions. When you're talking to me and expressing your feelings, I'd like to give you more back. Like, it's not even what you say. It's just being there and listening. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like I'll tell you things and you're just like, "Yeah." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My brain just starts, like, working and thinking, "How can I fix everything?" when I see you in pain. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I do appreciate you trying to put yourself out there more 'cause I definitely need that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, I want to help solve everything. Like, I'm very responsible, she said. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, you are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And just trying to, like, take charge and... you know, fix everything. This issue will always be out of my comfort zone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you and I'm thankful that you're trying to better yourself emotionally. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I definitely want to work on it. 'Cause, like, I have a lot going on. I don't ever have time to, like, think about what's happening with myself. Even if I had ten minutes alone every day, it would be helpful. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What exactly do you do that, like, you never have time for yourself? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, now you're being annoying. You're just trying to rile me up. And I just told you... You make it harder for me to open up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes, yes, you're right, you're right, you're right. Yeah, you're right. You're being serious-- I need to take you seriously. But, really, what is it that you do all day? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shut the up, literally. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've been a bad girl. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're a hot item in the rap community. I like French. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're in London? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I wanted to go on an adventure by myself for once. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I hate when my kids grow up. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are getting married in Paris. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Such a low-key little spot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's the back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, that's gorge. Whose new house is this? &gt;&gt; MASON: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? Holy &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This was not a plan. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is amazing. Family vacay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm riding an elephant in Thailand. This is crazy! &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to do it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Did you just touch my sister? Are youkidding me? &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, man. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What a vacation. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was incredible!
