- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, wait, I'm just, um, coming to lunch with Bruce. I love you. I'll call you in a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, where did you get those shoes? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, baby, how you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. What are you up to? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Lunch, just the two of us. &gt;&gt; KIM: I actually told Rob I was on my way here to have lunch with you, and he said there's a really good green drink. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's healthy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really. Well, we don't want to go too healthy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you do? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have a wedding to prepare for. It seems like yesterday that I was just getting proposed to, and now we have weeks before the wedding. There is so much more to do, so the pressure is on. I'm just like, "Let's hurry up and have the wedding so I can get pregnant again." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah... so the aisle thing at the... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just tell me where you want to go, where you want me to stand and I'll do whatever I need to do. &gt;&gt; KIM: So here's what I'm thinking. There was gonna be a-a fountain, a fountain, altar. So I was thinking of having you wait at this fountain and me walk from this fountain to this fountain by myself and having it be the dress moment, and then you pick me up and you walk me up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kind of like a relay race. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. So do I give you the bouquet and then you walk me up? Perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So don't worry about me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How the hell do you get in those things? Those shoes look like what my ass feels like when the hemorrhoids are acting up. Little dingleberries all over the place. &gt;&gt; KIM: I had a wedding dress fitting, and, Khloe, you're gonna die. Okay, look, that's the back. This is just a fitting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh! Oh, my God, that's gorge. You look so sexy. I love your veil. It's, like, so Princess Diana. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm, Princess Diana's wedding dress was, like, not... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I just mean, like, you look like a princess. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie was pissing me off over the weekend, and I said, "I'm gonna make you the ugliest bridesmaid's dress, and you're gonna be the only one stuck with it." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She called me crying 'cause you scared her. Do we all have different dresses? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I mean, I feel bad. Ever since we kind of decided we wanted, like, a small and intimate wedding, I feel like people's feelings are getting hurt and they... everyone wants to bring a plus-one. It's not that big, huge wedding that everyone's making it out to be. The venue physically can't hold that many. They will not allow it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When you get invited to a wedding, uh, like, do you assume it's a plus-one? Or you have to write...? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think people have been calling. Like, even Brody's like, "Can I bring my girlfriend?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you said no. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I love Brody, but I've never even met her. He just started dating her. Like, Rob's not bringing a date. Like, I just don't want a whole bunch of people that I don't know. I'm not even inviting, like, distant family. It's just super intimate. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is Rob even coming? For sure? &gt;&gt; KIM: I hope so. A year ago, he was like, "All right, if you ever get married, I want to walk you down the aisle." If he doesn't come for the way that he looks and he feels so insecure... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He just feels so ugly. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's really frustrating 'cause Rob has not given me, really, an answer if he's coming to my wedding or not. And to get our RSVP list down is just a must right now. And I want my brother there. Like, this is super frustrating. So it'll be Ponytail Bruce walking me down the aisle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My Little Pony is coming with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: My Little Pony will walk me down the aisle... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My Little Pony. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: We need to do a hug at this point. Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where are we sitting? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You guys sit right here. &gt;&gt; KAREN: You're right there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Here? Cool. &gt;&gt; KAREN: So we're super excited to have you, and I just want to thank you guys for coming in. I know it's been crazy. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're so excited, too. &gt;&gt; MAN: So it gives me great pleasure to give you your book. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, this is so weird. Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Isn't it beautiful? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It is. It's so weird that we're, like, holding our book. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are these, like, the first three? &gt;&gt; KAREN: Yes, this is it. Yeah. No one has gotten a copy. These are... these are the first ones. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So weird. Me and Kendall are in New York for a meeting about our book. It's a sci-fi novel, and we wanted to do something that people didn't really expect. I feel like Kendall and I get judged a lot, and, um, this was just something that we could do so it didn't have to be about us for a little and, like, we could just, like, do something creative and, like, cool. So it was fun. &gt;&gt; KAREN: The girls and-and Melanie, they're gonna be doing all the marketing and publicity for the book, and I thought it would be interesting, since they don't really know the genesis of how this all came about, how Lex and Livia, Kendall and Kylie, how you put yourselves into these characters and... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We were just all brainstorming, like, if we were... if Kendall and I were in a movie, like, what would we want to do. What would our characters... Like, whatever. We just came up with this whole idea of, like, Lex and Livia and, like, just our different personalities, how I'm more, like, edgy and Kendall's more, like... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: "Sophisticated" is what she was looking for. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So much of it was the girls wanting this to be sci-fi dystopia, distant from their everyday lives. &gt;&gt; KAREN: I think that's what's so refreshing about this book is that it is not what people expect, and I think you guys are not what people expect. They think they know you, but they don't. And so you have all these shades of your personality that you get to play out now. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Calendar-wise, you guys know, like, tweets and Facebook, some blogs. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Whatever platform you're comfortable with, it's just critical that you be a part of the social media. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KAREN: So you guys have any questions for us? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't think so. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: I'm glad you're happy with it. You both look so happy with it. We love it; we're very excited. &gt;&gt; KAREN: It's a beautiful book. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: It's very solid. I mean, the story's wonderful. You did it; it's worth it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye, everybody! Thank you! Thank you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye. Thank you, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just feel like ! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you rubbing your own boobs? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To try to feel better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is so random. I'm gonna try that tonight. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Sorry to interrupt. Um, do you guys want to go maybe talk upstairs about Kim's shower? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do we want to do it this weekend? And if so, we need to, like, step on it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought this was, like, pushing it too close. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is gonna be miraculous if we can do this. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Do you want to go upstairs? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, let's go. I am beyond excited to be throwing Kim her bridal shower. I know I told her that I would keep it small. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can have, like, a dinner, like, five, ten people. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would love to do that. &gt;&gt; KIM: But no party. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I promise if you let me do that for you, it'll be really small. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just a dinner; perfect. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I just can't help myself. It's getting bigger and bigger, and I hope she doesn't get upset. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: How are you guys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do we need to do a shower in general is the question. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We need to do something. And she won't let us do it in Paris, and that's where I thought we could get away with it. So what I was thinking was, say, we have this huge crazy meeting and I'll make something up and then she comes in. "Surprise!" And then we have a brunch, and everyone... it's, like, a lingerie shower. Get, like, Lee Gelfond to do the white chocolate Eiffel Towers. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: What about mimosas or Bloody Marys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All natural alcohol. Kourtney will stomp grapes for them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I will supply the champagne. I will get these bitches drunk before they walk in. When I look back at some of the most amazing days in my life, I always think about the time that I had a bridal shower. It will always be some of the most special memories that I hold. So I just really want to make sure that she has some of those same amazing, delicious memories that I hold near and dear to myself. And one day she'll thank me. We invite everyone. Whoever can come, can come. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: So we think, like, 50 to 60 people? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's gonna be phenomenal! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's gonna be buttery. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's gonna be buttery. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are having my second wedding dress fitting... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, I'm gonna see your dress? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you guys are gonna see my wedding dress, and I need your opinion. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait. What? &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause you are the style icon. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I'm so excited! I thought we were never gonna be able to see it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are the style icon and Kendall is the model. I knew that Kendall and Kylie were gonna be in New York. I think it's just the perfect opportunity for them to come with me to my dress fitting. Hi! No one's seen it before in the family, so I just want my sisters' opinion. This looks amazing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you going to put it on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; MAN: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, we're just here to look at it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's amazing that Kim's gonna have a Givenchy dress. It's one of her favorite designers. All she talks about is this dress, so I'm really excited to see it with my own eyes. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God! Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love it. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is what I call couture, people. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's beautiful. I love the long sleeves. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The long sleeves are ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like it's just different, and not a lot of people do it. beautiful in her dress. It's just so put together in details and everything. Kanye is gonna freak out. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wow! &gt;&gt; KIM: So good, right? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; MAN: It's giving me, like, chills. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. I am so excited for how my dress turned out. I mean, it is gorgeous. Everything is so perfect. It is probably the most beautiful dress I've ever seen in my life. It's really a dream come true. He's gonna love it so much. It's so beautiful. I'm so happy. &gt;&gt; MAN: He's going to... love. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited! It's so... chic. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's shaking in here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Packing for pushka. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How much clothes does one little kid need? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A lot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Little people... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm, can you shut the door for a second? Mm, I just... wanted to tell you... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mm? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...that I am pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I thought you s... You just keep suckering me into these kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wasn't, like, planning this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't handle all this responsibility. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Responsibility? For what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just can't take care of more kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have two children. I definitely had to build up the courage to tell Scott, because he's just been, like, super depressed, so I just don't want to set him off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You've known this for how long? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, when's the last time you had your period? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: March. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So you were pregnant when I took you away on your birthday? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I knew. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is ridiculous! It's always so sneaky with you! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You need to stop lying to me, and tell me honestly... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean you didn't know? You didn't drink. You obviously knew. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My plan was to wait until... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Till the kid popped out of you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, so you don't have to be anxious the whole time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This ain't good. One of my biggest annoyances with Kourtney is that she just wasn't honest. And she's known that she's been pregnant for, like, weeks. I just kind of thought, at two, we weren't gonna want to have more kids. Now having to take care of three, I mean, it's freaking me out just saying it. This is ridiculous! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This was not a plan. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You just keep suckering me in... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? It takes two to tango. Like, what did you think was gonna happen? &gt;&gt; KIM: Brody is really upset that Mom decided to pay for Brandon and Leah to come to the wedding. Brody is like, "How dare she extend the invitation to Brandon but not to me?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I make you some soup, Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, thanks. I can't eat anything right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your tummy's that bad? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't have the conversation with anybody in my family. I'm just not ready. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRODY: Bruce is coming in. We've got to say hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: Where's Bruce? &gt;&gt; KAITLYNN: Oh, he's right here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRODY: He's like, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!" Look at this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, you can drink on the job? &gt;&gt; KAITLYNN: Hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yo, Bruce! We're gonna do about four or five songs, we're gonna give you the headphones and you take over. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll put Beethoven on. I love it that my kids find all these things to do in life. Now, Brody getting into the DJ world-- not really my crowd. But it's important that I support what he's doing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Come up here for a second. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think it'll be a fun night. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KAITLYNN: Spin it around. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brody and his relationships-- there's been many. But Kaitlynn seems to be a little bit different. He talks very highly of her. She seems to be pretty good for him. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Having fun? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fabulous! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say I love you, KoKo. Why are you so mean to me sometimes? Ew! Are you a kitty? I Super Glued my hand to your foot. I can't get off. I can't. You know when I could get off is when you tell me that you love me. &gt;&gt; MASON: I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How much? &gt;&gt; MASON: All the way to the moon and back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you serious?! &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Morning! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, it's Kris Jenner! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I heard you weren't feeling very good so I brought you a deli tray and some chicken noodle soup. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Chicken noodle soup. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A jelly tray? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A deli tray. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I thought you said a jelly tray. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A deli tray-- lox and cream cheese and bagels... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was gonna say is there vodka in that jelly? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, no. I'm gonna put it in here. Can I make you some soup, Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, thanks. I can't eat anything right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your tummy's that bad? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sick. I have the stomach flu. I really just can't even deal with any of this right now. I can't have the conversation with anybody in my family. I'm just not ready. And because of how Scott has reacted, it's not, like, a joyous occasion at this moment, so I just can't... I just don't feel like talking about it with anybody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Feel better, Kourtney. I love you. Bye, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye, Kris. You look gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KIM: What have those purple flowers been doing on the floor in that exact spot for two weeks? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I don't know what to do with them, honey. I work too hard to worry about purple flowers. &gt;&gt; KIM: Give them to Bruce. You like purple. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love purple. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are the flowers? I'll take them. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're right there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it's a live plant? &gt;&gt; BOTH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, of course I'll take it. So, why was I summoned over here? &gt;&gt; KIM: We wanted to do a little negotiations with you. In regards to your hairstyle for the wedding, since you're gonna be in the wedding. Since you're gonna be in the wedding! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, he's not just "in the wedding." He's walking you down the aisle. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not one eye's going to be on me. They're all gonna be on you and your dress. What's it-- 20 feet, 30 feet? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Bruce looks really handsome when his hair is cut short. And, you know, it's my wedding and I want him to look his best. And from popular vote, I have heard that Bruce looks better without the ponytail. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what? I will make sure that my hair looks good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, your idea of what it looks good and my idea of what looks good are two to... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, well, that's true. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...two totally different things. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's true; I-I totally agree with that. Mine's kind of Malibu good. &gt;&gt; KIM: And mine is like Paris chic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Beverly Hills. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, Paris chic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it's Beverly Hills. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Paris chic. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What would you want to do? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I'm very well aware that you won't cut your ponytail. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's true. &gt;&gt; KIM: But my number one goal would be cut the hair, 'cause you just look better with shorter hair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But it's gonna be 15 seconds. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you know, at my age, you know how long it takes for your hair to grow back? It's, like, so slow. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's taken me a year, year and a half to get this length. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She just has a certain vision of how she wants her wedding party to look, and she wants to be really proud of you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But I'm like the least important... &gt;&gt; KIM: I want you to look amazing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: With this mug, I'll look perfect. I know I'll make you happy, 'cause it'll be a happy moment. I'm walking you down the aisle. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll keep all of this in mind. I will make sure that my hair looks good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah, kids. What happened to this? How do I have a flat tire? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't have a flat tire. You have a cracked... it's-gonna-break-in-half tire. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My butt doesn't fit. Ugh! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, obviously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just put the middle divider up the crack of my ass, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just chillin' in there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just chillin'. It's okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Holy &gt;&gt; KHLOE:gets real over here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No pun intended. I don't know how to break this to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not into... talking about it, because I don't want to really believe it just yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, obviously, you know, once in a blue moon, I sleep with your sister. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And on those random occasions... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, no. Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...she gets pregnant every single time. And I just didn't, like, know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, has she told anyone? You shouldn't have told me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. She won't tell anybody. She wasn't gonna tell me! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm definitely not shocked Kourtney's pregnant. I mean, Kourtney always talks about having more kids. But I do think it's funny that Scott is telling me before Kourt. It's definitely a first. Wait. So, you're not happy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well... I mean, I got two kids already. That's a lot. And I have a boy and a girl. I barely feel like I could take care of myself. I'm, like, holding on by a string here. If we lived in, like, Oklahoma and didn't travel, I'd say, "Fine, keep popping 'em out. What else are we gonna do?" But traveling all the time and airplanes all the time and... that's where it's hard. Like, now, three kids in the plane? Like, That's aarmy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love Scott. He's my brother. I am very appreciative that he feels like he can talk to me and confide in me. But it also puts me in a really weird situation. 'Cause I cannot imagine being in Kourtney's place and my man is not happy. That's horrible. So I don't really know how I'm supposed to react. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Having another kid right now is so scary. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna be fine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not fine now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Will you talk to Brody? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I will. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause I just... I... It... I'm, like, at my snapping point to where I will snap at him for talking about my mom, 'cause I've heard it through a few people that he's been talking about her. I will go theoff on him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is, like, freaking out. He is really depressed and just saying he can't handle it. I just could see him use this as an excuse to throw all responsibility away and be a wild animal. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Kourtney's clothes really disturb me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. They're very weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: It all looks like a vintage shop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guys, I look like a vagabond. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your ass looks so ginormous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a zebra. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I've never seen anything... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it looks good. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, it's not zebra. It's very tribal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But what do I wear? 'Cause my vagina is so big. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Run errands and then have dinner with Malika. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I want to be... &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, just a long view... It's long. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is you walking around with your big vagina, and you're, like, &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is. My bigvagina. I don't like it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your vagina's long. CTC-- cover the camel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Covers the cam. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Brody is really upset that Mom decided to pay for Brandon and Leah to come to the wedding. Brody's, like, "How dare she extend the invitation to Brandon, but not to me?" Brandon and Leah have been the most supportive ever of my mom and Bruce and their split, and they love to do all the things that Bruce loves to do, so my mom and Bruce decided that, together, they want to treat Brandon and Leah to this Paris trip, because having them come is the best way for Bruce to really enjoy his vacation. I feel really bad, because, she's just doing a good thing-- paying for Brandon and Leah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I think you should call Bruce and just let him deal with it, 'cause you'll get into a fight with Brody. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not even about the money. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This always happens. &gt;&gt; KIM: We don't want Bruce to be there by himself. And now, she's being painted as this villain just because she tried to do something nice. You know, my mom always gets the short end of the stick here, and I'm just not gonna let... allow that to happen anymore. Like, it's just time that everyone grows up, and Bruce needs to, you know, talk to his own son. It's his own brother. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It really sucks. Your mom always gets the short end of the stick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kourt. Is that your accessory for the day? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? Some Nillas? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's it to you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't know who you are, don't care. How does this person have my new number? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should I see? Hello? &gt;&gt; MAN: Hello, baby! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY (with French accent): Who is this? &gt;&gt; MAN: Baby! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You hung up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm busy with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You just hang up. They keep saying, "Baby! Baby!" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you having your Nillas? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why not? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, do you want any real food? You could have some of my Chipotle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh-uh. Just want a Nilla. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just a Nilla. Think they're the best ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a pretty divine snack. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. If I didn't know Kourtney was pregnant, I would have figured it out by now. The box of Nillas, just, like, chowing down. Dude, I know what's really going on. You got a bun in that oven. Do you let those, like, soften in your mouth? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I could tell. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I let 'em soak in, and like them when they're a little bit stale. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can just tell by the way that she's looking at me that she knows that I'm pregnant, and I have a feeling that Scott told her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know you did. A little too well. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How many rooms do you need? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are they monster suites or are they just deluxe rooms? Well, can you ask? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you joking with your attitude? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No! merci. Buh-bye, buh-bye. What's the weather gonna be like in Paris? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rainy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Awesome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... did you tell Khloe? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? What's is to you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, you should tell me! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't need to tell you, she's your sister. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right... so wouldn't you think maybe I'd want to tell her? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I'm sorry... I ruined your little surprise. should call everybody else in your squad... and let them know... so it's not some big secret. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was being so secretive, because you're having such a hard time with it, I don't want to, like, further depress you if anyone, God forbid, says, "Congratulations." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you mocking me while I'm down? I'm emotionally messed up. Why knock me while I'm down? You are not easy to deal with-- don't let anybody tell you different. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh... please. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think the most difficult person to deal with, that I've ever met, is you. difficult. Have you ever come across somebody more difficult than yourself? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I-I... You're up there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's happening? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think that the bride should be eating baked potatoes? Just trying to save you from yourself. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm all right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You'll thank me in the morning. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, what about a chocolate chip cookie instead? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brandoni. Plates are outside. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Are you excited for Paris? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. Is Rob gonna make it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just asked him today, "What do you think?" And he was like, "Think so." &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, I hope so. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, is Rob flying with us? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are my kids in the rehearsal? You still haven't told me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, they are, 'cause Mason really has a lot of work to do. He'll be the ring bearer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is gonna be so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Penelope has to throw flowers out. North'll be in front and P will be behind her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: P will be eating the flowers. &gt;&gt; KIM: We've tried to keep everything, just really a secret and just so that no information gets out and nothing has, so... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, what would it even matter if it did? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just 'cause we want things to be surprises for people. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are we staying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have you all taken care of. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is Brandon and Leah at the same hotel? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, they sure are. I thought you and I would share a room, is that okay? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hell, yeah, get your freak on in Paris. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm ready. I can handle you. Ta-da. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wanted to tell you... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...that... I didn't want to say it in front of Mom, because it'll hurt her feelings... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...but I think Brody's upset, because you and Mom paid for Brandon and Leah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. Brody can get a little huffy at times. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but I think he'll only listen to you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And he asked to bring, you know, his girlfriend, and I said no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, which obviously, that's not gonna happen. &gt;&gt; KIM: Once you get there, you'll see the location of what I'm talking about and then you'll see, so I feel bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I understand, I understand, it's your wedding, you do what you want. &gt;&gt; KIM: Brody has been saying that my mom is favoring Brandon and Leah and I just think that, like, this shouldn't be my mom's problem. So, will you talk to Brody? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I will. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause I just, I, it, I'm, like... just to be totally honest with you, I'm my snapping point, to where I will snap at him for talking about my mom. 'Cause I've heard it through a few people, that he's been talkingabout her and I've had it to the point where no one will talk bad about my mom anymore. My mom's always made to seem like this evil stepmom and never tries and never does anything, when she is the one that is, like, bent over backwards for everyone. So, everyone better get over their issues, because I'm just, I don't have time for it... and I'm not gonna sit back and let anyone talk bad about my mom. She's gotten the short end of the stick for years and everyone has disliked her, when all she's doing is helping. So, I'm to the point where I will go theoff on him. I know I told my mom she could plan a bridal shower, but I thought it was just going to be a little dinner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello... Scott was supposed to come home last night from Mexico. Now his phone is totally off and I have no idea where he is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, you leave Saturday? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I leave Saturday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom and I are on the same flight on Sunday. Um... so, I wanted to tell you something... At first, I didn't want to tell everyone, but since Khloe already knows, I might as well tell my mom and Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, God, what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That I'm pregnant. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. I haven't told Mom yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you going to? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's just annoying to tell things to. But I guess we should. &gt;&gt; KIM: A new baby is coming into the world and I'm so excited for her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim wanted to tell you something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know what to do, I'm freaking out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't tell me you're pregnant? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am. And if I gain one pound before my wedding, my dress fits like a glove and I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you really pregnant? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bible? &gt;&gt; KIM: No...! But... Kourtney is! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't believe you guys anymore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're pregnant? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is amazing! Give me a hug! Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks, well, I just don't know what to do, because... &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so good! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is, like, freaking out. He's, like, really depressed and just saying he can't handle it. He just doesn't know what to do. And he went to Mexico this morning-- he had an appearance in Cancun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because of what he's done in the past, I just could see him use this as an excuse to just... throw all responsibility away and just, you know, be a wild animal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott is not in a good place, which means he can't go to these appearances and get crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good... &gt;&gt; CAROLE: How are these staying put? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're little-- they're not as big as most people's. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I shaved my legs today for the first time, in like, two weeks. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: I shaved my legs this morning, too! I was like, "Oh,, I'm gonna have to put a dress on," and jumped in the shower. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: This is unacceptable, you guys are not grandmas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think my mom did a fantastic job of putting Kim's shower together. Everything looks amazing and I just hope that she loves everything as much as we do. Be quiet! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim and Kris are just pulling up. I don't know, do we like hide? I don't understand what we do. &gt;&gt; ALL: Surprise...! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Surprise, Kim! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look so hot. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know I told my mom she could plan a bridal shower, but I thought it was just gonna be a little dinner-- nothing like this. I had no idea that this many people would be there and that people were flying in for it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love that dress. &gt;&gt; KIM: I bought it like six or seven years ago. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I need one like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I never wore it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Today is the day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! My corset broke again. I'm safety pinned into this bitch; I have to sit like this. &gt;&gt; LARSA: I'm dying to see North. &gt;&gt; KIM: She says, "Bye." "Say, 'bye-bye'," she'll go, "ba-ba." &gt;&gt; LARSA: Ooh... I love her. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then she'll say, "Daddy" and "Dad." &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Do you want to have more than two though? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I, I'm gonna have another one and if it's a girl, I'm definitely gonna go for a boy and if it's a boy, I might be done. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah, you can totally handle three. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I kind of hope it's another girl and then there'll be two BFF's. And then I have a boy. That's, like, my dream. &gt;&gt; LARSA: They're gonna be so cute together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney has an announcement to make. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you, Kim. You know how I feel. And I'm not gonna cry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I just want to say that it just means so much to all of us that you guys are all here celebrating such a special time for Kim and the fact that... you know I cry at everything, so I'll just get it over with and bawl, but you know, I think that we all know... that Kim and Kanye have been obsessed with each other, and the fact that she's going off to marry the love of her life-- it's just the greatest thing in the world. And we all know the journey that she's had and been on and that she's brought all of us along with her and it's just a joy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, thanks for not going on this bumpy ride with me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: As Kim's mom, I could not be prouder of her and Kanye. And I am so genuinely happy that they have found each other, because I think they're pretty much a perfect match. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh! It's a little Eiffel Tower. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: That's so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: How cute is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe's always like, "You're the sexiest person, but you wear the ugliest pajamas." Like, Kanye threw away all my pajamas. I wear knee socks and ugly sweats and ugly pajamas with, like, patterns all over it, like hearts. I am so surprised and so happy that my mom really took the time to plan this shower and to make it so special for me. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Ready? One, two, three. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So cute! &gt;&gt; KIM: It's really good to celebrate with everyone, especially since some people won't be able to make it to Paris for the festivities. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'm hopping in. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Okay, hop in. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, ready? One, two, three. Scariest thing you've ever seen! Aah! &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: How do we get one of these things? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim's getting one in her house. Every time she leaves the door, she'll take a picture. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. Scott was supposed to come home from the airport last night from Mexico, and he never came home. I haven't heard from him at all. And I have no idea where he is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, Scott never came home last night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He landed from the airport at 6:00 and he wrote me, "I might go to dinner at Mr. Chow or Nobu with Sartiano." And then before I went to bed, I said, "Hello? I'm going to bed." And then he didn't respond. And then I woke up at, like, midnight, and he still hadn't responded, so I wrote Sartiano and he was like, "No, we never went to dinner." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's insane. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then I called him in the middle of the night, but he wasn't answering. And now his phone is totally off. I am worried. It's not like him to not answer the phone. And just knowing that he's so depressed, I just hope that he's okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll call him and text him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: His phone's off. I'm just gonna have to wait until he hopefully wakes up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is Brody still kind of upset about the plus ones? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I honestly haven't even talked to him about it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? It doesn't look like I'm gonna get any help from Brandon and Leah in trying to explain this to Brody. &gt;&gt; KIM: Brody is a little upset that you're paying for Brandon and Leah to go to the wedding and not him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's the reason he's not coming to a wedding? That's crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I kind of like keeping it long. &gt;&gt; PHILIP: Yeah, I mean, I do like things long... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; PHILIP: ...but there's a few that might be a little bit heavy. What we can do is just lighten a little bit without cutting the length. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. I'm going to my room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going up to the room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, um, I'm glad that you're home safe. But I just want you to know that, like, it's not okay. Like, you have a family. You can't just, like, say, "Oh, I landed," and then never contact us. Like, that's crazy. And not to mention I couldn't sleep all night. I was worried. I kept checking your room every second, thinking that you were literally dead. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I definitely feel horrible that I put Kourtney through a rough time, especially now that she is pregnant. But I honestly just didn't want to get back to reality and I didn't want to face anybody. It's just a lot on me right now, especially with everything else that I've dealt with in the past year and I should've made a responsible decision, but I didn't. I understand. I got issues I need to work out. And I'll do whatever I can and do whatever it takes, but I just don't know how to get to feel normal again and not be depressed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, whatever you're doing is not gonna make you feel better. You can't make an excuse to make yourself think that's okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, there's no excuse. I don't think it's okay at all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: At the place where Scott is right now, I know that he's so depressed and he really can't help himself. I want to be able to help Scott, but I need support, too. And I really just feel like I don't even know what to do at this point. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just a bad person. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're not a bad person, but I want you to fix this depression and I'll help you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just need to sleep. I just can't sleep anymore with my insomnia. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Where did our dog go? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just right there. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh. Hi. Hello. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: If you ever want to look, look down there... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Those are always good dogs when you don't even have to think about your dogs and all of a sudden you say, "I wonder where the dog went." And you turn around and there's the dog right there. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I know, right? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Brody's dogs on the other hand, they're... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I haven't, uh... How's Brody's dogs doing? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: They're good dogs and they actually, when they're around Gus... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, by the way, is Brody still kind of upset about the plus one? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I honestly haven't even really talked to him about it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, 'cause, I mean, it's... Kim's doing everything to keep it small and just bring immediate people. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'll let you guys figure that out. I'm gonna go jump in the ocean. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. I've worked really hard to try to get my relationship with Brody working well. But still it's kind of a work in progress. And it doesn't look like I'm gonna get any help from Brandon and Leah in trying to explain this to Brody. I'm gonna have to kind of go this one alone, you know, for Brody and I to continue to have a good relationship. Oh, come on, cut it with the pictures. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have blue hair. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you gonna have bl-blue hair for the wedding? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does Kim know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You kind of look like My Little Pony meets... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Katy Perry. You're turning into, like, punk-rock Barbie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Brandon! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Brandon! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You've got your wetsuit on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do. I'm all ready. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's on backwards. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I like your blue hair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It is? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's on backwards? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I have to go change it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: The zipper goes in the back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. Quick change. Nobody told me. I am really excited to be spending the day with Brandon and Leah. And I'm excited to learn how to paddleboard. But in true Kris form, I've already made my first mistake of the day, which is I have my wetsuit on backwards. Perfect. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Much better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oop! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's happened before, don't worry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys, this isn't funny. Be calm... be calm... be calm... I got this... aah! I'm not gonna lie-- this looked a lot easier than it actually is. And I feel... ridiculous. Aah...! Oh! Abandoning ship! Get off... oh! Whoa! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So Scott surfaced. I just told him that he has to go away to someplace and figure it out. I just need to make sure, like, the right place. I've been trying to figure out how to help Scott and I'm not sure if sending him away somewhere to work on his issues is the best thing for him. I'm not even exactly sure if Scott has an issue with alcohol, or if he's using it to numb his depression from losing both of his parents. I'm just trying to think of all of our options, so that we can make the best decision for him. Do you think that that, um, Arizona place is the best place? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. I mean, the only thing I wonder if he's the kind of person I think would have a problem sitting with a group of people... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and going, "My name is, you know, Jane, and I've got a problem." 'Cause he gets social anxiety if he has to talk to other people. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm selling that house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't think you should make a rash decision. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not really making a rash decision. making a rash decision by saying we're moving for the summer at this point in our life. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MASON: Hello! Oh! No! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sit on the floor, just like I thought. Get in there. Be the boy who lives in the cupboard. Good kid. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Mm! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want to go in there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello! Look, Kourt. There's some crackers in here. Do you want to get them? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Open the crackers. Oh! It's Mason crackers! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who is that? &gt;&gt; MASON: Ow, ow, ow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I was thinking of maybe staying in the Hamptons and renting a house for the whole summer. I mean, Scott always says he has all these happy memories there as a kid, and like, every time we were at his parents', we, like, feed the deer and then we go down to the beach and it's, like, the woods. But on the beach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're a trip. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom was right. Scott gets so anxious in new environments. So I really think that going to the Hamptons could be a great thing for Scott and our family for the summer. It's a really calm environment and it just might be a good place where he can finally deal with some of the pain that he's been pushing aside. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I think your first thing you have to do to decide what's happening is you've got to talk to Scott. 'Cause what if he says, "Absolutely not"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is a good plan. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is a good plan. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll talk to him... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you're a good girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and you let me know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you look great in yellow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, why, thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not everyone could pull it off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you? You look good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks, boo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Boo thang... you look as good as a chicken wing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. That's what I was going for. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is Kat invited to the wedding or not? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Sorry, 'cause... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...there's not enough room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: People are calling every day, trying to get their plus ones invited, and we just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...the venue does not have the space, like, we cannot add one more person. The pressure, the guest list... it's so, so, so tough. We want to invite all of our friends, but we just don't have the space for it. The venue is at capacity, so it's been the hardest thing ever. It's super stressful, because everyone's asking to bring people, so I just want to stay out of it, but it's, like... Brody is a little upset that you're paying for Brandon and Leah to go to the wedding and not him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just... that doesn't even make any sense. He flies all over the world and he has a ton of points. And by the way, I don't think I did anything wrong, except try to be an amazing stepmom. If that's the reason he's not coming to a wedding, that's crazy. He should just tell me and we'll figure it out. Here's the thing. This happens to every single bride. This is how weddings go. There's always going to be that one family member or relative who gets their feelings hurt. It'll be, "Oh, this person's in the wrong seat. That aunt is up in the second row, why am I in the back?" You know? I mean, that's just the way life is. It's like Thanksgiving dinner. You're gonna have family drama. You just are. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to be super fair and nice and always go with the flow, but I see how much, like, my mom takes from everybody. And she just is so calm and seems to let it not bother her, but I'm sure it does. She doesn't have to feel bad for doing something generous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are gonna have more drama than you ever thought you would ever sign up for. And that's just what happens at weddings, so get ready. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna change my e-mail. &gt;&gt; KIM: Guys, it is so hot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, what's going on? Did the air conditioning stop? When your mom's not here, she doesn't care. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. So... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...the Dash New York store is... going down. The rent's gonna go up in October when our lease is up. So I just feel like we need to find a new location. But I really think we need to go out there to pick the spot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I do, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I was thinking after Paris, we fly to New York and then... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And then go home from there? What's the point? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...we could stay for the summer in New York and get a house in the Hamptons. We've been talking about doing this for years. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like that's already gone and past. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just thought maybe it would still be nice to go out there. We could even stay at the house and fix it up, or... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't want to stay there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, then, we could stay somewhere else... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm selling that house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and decide if we want it. You are gonna sell it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think you should make a rash decision. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not really making a rash decision. making a rash decision by saying we're moving to the Hamptons for the summer at this point in our life. It's like, it would've been amazing to enjoy being out there while my parents were there. And now it's like, now we're finally gonna go, after they just died? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was thinking about the whole Hamptons thing that we were talking about. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right now, it's very difficult to look at the positives when I'm still so upset and still so angry. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I have this appearance in Huston and... I mean, it's probably not the best timing right now, but last thing I want to do is let anybody down. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Make some noise for Scott Disick in the building! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can I get a club soda and a lime? You know, I... probably don't deserve Kourt coming with me, but I do appreciate that she's kind of holding my hand for some support that I do need right now. It's going to be fun to sleep in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know! I might have to... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I might have to. I don't feel well. I decided to go to Houston with Scott because I just don't want him to be alone and depressed. It's definitely not my number one choice of things to do, but I'm just trying to be here for him and support him in anything that he needs. &gt;&gt; MAN: We're going to do a shot together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a shot of water. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks for coming with me to this thing. You're a fun girl... but could be a buzzkill to some maybe. But I needed a buzzkill and just needed to relax on this trip. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You definitely did. I was thinking about the whole Hamptons thing that we were talking about. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And that you just have more, like, negative memories that we didn't go visit. You had such positive memories when you were younger. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, look. I'd like to think of the place in a good light, not in a bad one, just because that's where my parents, you know, kind of ended their time, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to push you if it's too hard. It's hard for me to even go there knowing that they're not there, so I can't imagine what it's like for you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, for right now, it's very difficult to look at the positives when I'm still so upset and still so angry that I had to lose my parents at such a young age and them being so young and it's just so difficult to admit and believe that they're both gone and I'm never gonna see them again. I like it out there and I know it's summertime and we have a lot of friends and good support and... all that's great, it's just... it's so frustrating that every single year, my parents asked me and you... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...to spend the summer out there with them. Finally now we have the time to go... and they don't have the time because they're gone. I need time to, like, get my head wrapped around all that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We want him along for the ride, but I just couldn't do everybody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want Kris meddling in with the whole Brody thing. I got to go find him. I'm just trying to figure out the whole wedding thing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Brandon and Leah are there. That's all you care about. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have our passports, right? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes, I just took your passport. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim is actually leaving for Paris. And it's so exciting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you ready to go to Paris, cutie? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing here? And in lingerie? Are you about to hook up with someone? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm just trying on, like, what wedding lingerie I want for the week. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is this from your shower? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: You like it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie got me the robe. And Malika and Khadijah got me the bra and underwear. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does it go together? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, and it's, like, so important that I have all the right stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: How was Houston? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was exhausting. I was so tired and had to go to a club and pretend like I was having fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: Was he still, like, freaking out, though? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He was like, "So, if you do this, I mean, I'm just gonna have to leave and move to another country." &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe it's, like, too much change that, like, there will be this new person, and then he's totally leaving his parents and starting a full new life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because now he has this new baby that his parents will never get to meet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, then we sat down. I was like, "Okay, since I'm having another child, you are leaving? I just need to confirm." And then he, like, smiled. And then he started, like, softening up and being nicer and, like, I think he was starting to wrap his head around everything. &gt;&gt; KIM: Three kids is, like, the perfect family. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm definitely overwhelmed thinking about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would be, too. Well, he's gonna have to learn how to handle it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Or else I'm gonna be a single mom with three kids. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to babysit North for the day and see what it's like with three? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I wouldn't recommend it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, hey, supermodel. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How cute are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at your eyebrows. They're gone. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know, they're gone. &gt;&gt; KIM: They look so pretty, though. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I look crazy. You don't have good service. I can't see you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'm gonna call you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. So, she's trying to back out of a big gig. And she should do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I talked to her this morning, and she did sound down just because she's been on the road for what-- three weeks? Working her little butt off. I've done that where I've been on the road, you know, for, like, weeks at a time, and it's just like you're so... &gt;&gt; KIM: She gets homesick, but if she wants to be a model, models can't get homesick. You live in a suitcase. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Totally agree. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Totally agree. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like there's no crying in baseball. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sleep on the plane. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim wants you to come to the wedding, you know? Becau... I mean, I don't want to make you feel bad either by telling you all this, but, well, you know, we're gonna have an adventure and it will be really fun and we want him along for the ride, but I just couldn't do everybody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I hear Kris talking to Brandon and Leah trying to get to the bottom of the whole Brody thing. Kim was the one who, you know, came to me and said, "Please talk to Brody." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, I've organized dinners every night and, you know, we're gonna have a lot of fun. And it, and it's my pleasure, but tell him to get himself to Paris and we'll figure it out. I mean, if, and if you don't think that's the good way to handle it, but, and after thinking about it, then call me back and tell me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want Kris to kind of be the fall guy for this and I don't want her on the phone kind of meddling in with Brandon and Leah, uh, to try to, you know, calm this whole thing down. Honestly, this is my responsibility. I'm the one who needs to talk to Brody. Uh, so I got to go find him. I'm just trying to figure out the whole wedding thing. I got nobody to hang with. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You've been calling Brandon and Leah every day to make sure they're going. First I've even seen you come around and be like, "Oh, the wedding." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't hang that on me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brod? Brod... &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's all good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you feeling about your blue hair? Are you wearing it for the wedding? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's everyone's big question. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did Kim freak out? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I told her. I warned her before. She was like, "No, absolutely not." And then I was like... "Telling me not to dye my hair a color makes me want to dye it even more, so I'm just letting you know I'm going to." And she was like, "Whatever." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're such a brat. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And then Mom was like, "You look like a Skittle." And I was like, "I'm gonna have this hair for two years now 'cause you said that." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did she tell you the big news? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? You're pregnant? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Isn't she always? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're not pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bible. Pregnant. Number three. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Say Bible. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bible. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: B-I-B-L-E? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but don't tell Kenny. I want to tell her myself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that insane? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's so funny! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just think it's funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, like, wants to kill himself. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I can see he wants to kill himself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna be happy once the little person comes, but it's a lot to deal with. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do not have unprotected sex. You hear me? Even if you have to double up on birth control, just do it. Little pill. She evidently thinks that's too hard. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, when did you find out? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's known forever! She just didn't tell anybody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: P... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, it's Pooh-Pooh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi, P! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aw! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi, P. What's your name, P? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Poosh? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Dada. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'm Dada. What's that girl's name? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's my name? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Mama. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you say KyKy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm scared, yes, about having another child and I definitely didn't take it the right way... but God willing, like every other child I've had... they become amazing and blessings in my life. I just need to think of the positive, relax and enjoy... the third time around. Uh-oh, uh-oh. : Uh-oh, look who it is! It's a Mar-dee! Give me a kiss, Penelope. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's happening...? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I didn't know that was you... okay, okay. You're just creeping over like that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: On my way to the golf course; something you should be... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Course you are. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...something you should be doing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: See, here I am, playing with my dogs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Playing with your dogs. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, somebody's got to do it. I'm just trying to teach them how to... catch, bring it back. Tank, come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How do you tell the difference between the two? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Good boy. Different markings, you know? Like, see, he's got more black, like, just like me and my markings on my face now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, he looks more like you? &gt;&gt; BRODY: You know, so, I'm going to Cabo, so I had to... get ready for it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, you're going to Cabo-- is that your next trip? &gt;&gt; BRODY: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm just trying to figure out the whole wedding thing. You know, I heard you're not going, right? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm not going, no. I'm not losing sleep over it, I swear, like, I'm actually, I'm, I'm happy that I get this weekend off. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can tell from Brody's body language that, uh, you know... he's trying to brush it off, but I... he's a little bit upset here. It's not the plus one and all that kind of stuff, none of that? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I did say, "Kim, if I go, I would love to be able to bring my girlfriend along," you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, but it's not gonna be the same if you don't go. Have you and I ever been to Paris before? No... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Uh, not together-- I've been, though. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've got nobody to hang with... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, you do, you have Brandon and Leah... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brandon and Leah are going, they're gonna be out... &gt;&gt; BRODY: ...you know that's all you care about. Brandon and Leah are there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No... no... no... no. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's okay, you'll be, you'll be, It's all good, you'll be happy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not even close... &gt;&gt; BRODY: You've been calling Brandon and Leah every day to make sure they're going. I... have not gotten one... this is the first I've even seen you come around and be like, "Oh... the wedding." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brody, I-I think he gets the feeling like, oh, we love Brandon and Leah better than we like him and this and that-- which is a bunch of bull. Don't hang that on me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's fine... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Throw... throw. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's all good. You know, it's all good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want you to know, uh, as far as Brandon and Leah going, that was Kris's and my decision. I mean, you know, Brandon for the last year, really, he comes over all the time... to see how I'm doing... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I think... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...and so, because of that... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I mean, that's fine, but y-you know, it does, at the end of the day, it's like, you guys were focused on making sure Brandon and Leah went and Brody never received one phone call. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The bottom line is, I just want you to know that... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm not... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...I wish you were gonna go. I'd rather have you there. We could hang in Paris-- we've never done that before. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm fine, yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You sure? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Life goes on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can I send you pictures? Maybe a video of it or...? &gt;&gt; BRODY: What? Oh, I'm sure I'll see many of those... I can't get away from it-- I turn on the TV and I see stuff about the wedding. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, as long as you're okay. See how they respond to me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm good. How's that knee? Mine's, you know... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it gets a little stiff. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, mine, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brody is a very, kind of, sensitive guy. Maybe I didn't handle this whole thing properly; I have to try harder to communicate with Brody earlier, so, you know, it doesn't get to this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One... two... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Three! Go get it, go get it. Radar's faster than Tank, but... Good boys, bring it back, Tank. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Tank! &gt;&gt; BRODY: See that's... we're working on that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Aw... Tank... &gt;&gt; BRODY: That's why we're working on it, we're working on the... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're working on the retrieving thing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. How you doing? &gt;&gt; MOVER: Good, good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So you're going to take this today? &gt;&gt; MOVER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Gonna take the Lambo tomorrow? &gt;&gt; MOVER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Now, you guys going straight to New York, or you got a lot of stops? &gt;&gt; MOVER: Straight to New York. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, perfect. Sounds like a plan, thank you. Hey, doll. I'm almost packed up. I got the cars on the truck going to the Hamptons. Sent all my clothes, sent my cars, sent my sneakers, sent my shoes. I think I sent my watches... Yeah, I'm good. As nervous as I am about moving across the country... I know that once we get to the Hamptons and we're all settled in, I think it's gonna be good for everybody, especially my family. I just want to be there for them and, I guess, that's really what my parents would have wanted anyway. All right, I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Five, six, seven, eight... nine. &gt;&gt; MOVER: Nine? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think we're good. Uh, your cars are here. &gt;&gt; KIM: We know, Mom. We got it all handled. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys got it all together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Then I just have to put something else in one bag. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim is actually leaving for Paris, and it's so exciting. &gt;&gt; KIM: You keep our passports, right? &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Yes, I just keep your passport. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's going to marry the love of her life and it's going to be perfect. So now we just have to get everybody else over there on time, safe and sound. Kim, you look beautiful. I love you so much. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KIM: Please look for my Nori necklace. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's somewhere inside. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll scour the whole house and I'll bring it to Paris, don't worry. And if you remember where you put it, call me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. We are off to Paris and it's so crazy. I can't believe the wedding is right around the corner. Everything has happened so fast, and I am so excited. Are you ready to go to Paris, cutie? That big smile... I know you are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, Kim! See you in Paris. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're in Paris, bitches! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You look so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe the whole family's together and it's wedding week. I am so excited. &gt;&gt; KIM: The veil is so big he needs to bend down and, like, pull it up like this. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kanye actually wanted to marry Kim... five years ago. He was madly in love with her then. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hear, hear. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's exciting. The nerves are setting in. The music is starting! I can't believe that in a couple minutes, I'm gonna be walking down the aisle.
