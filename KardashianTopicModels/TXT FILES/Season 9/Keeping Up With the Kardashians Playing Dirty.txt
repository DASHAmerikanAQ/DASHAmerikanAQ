- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MASON: Grandma, Grandma! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hear my son down there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your son? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you talking about Robert? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My son! &gt;&gt; KRIS:Mason! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My son is here! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come here. Come over here. Oh, Ma... Oh, thanks. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Not so cool, Grandma. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Lay like this, like a baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys... &gt;&gt; MASON: I don't actually be like a baby. Dad always calls me like a baby. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're not a baby. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're not a baby. You're a big boy. Don't let anyone tell you you're a baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're my baby. Remember? You're my son, I told you that. &gt;&gt; MASON: You know what KoKo tell me one time? "I'm your other mom." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She did? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She told us that when we were growing up, too. &gt;&gt; MASON: KoKo, one day I'll come tell you how to play sword fight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! If you come and sword fight with me, I'm gonna beat you so good! &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm gonna kick your butt! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, let's go. Let's try it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? What? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, time! &gt;&gt; MASON: No! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, I'm naked under there. Do you want the whole world to see my goods? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guess what. &gt;&gt; MASON: What?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're going in the fireplace! &gt;&gt; MASON: I can't! Hey, KoKo, can I just stop? &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Can I just stop?" ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's up, Bruiser? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you've got snakes? &gt;&gt; MASON: I got them at the dentist. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, they're scary. You got them at the dentist. &gt;&gt; MASON: Dad, look. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's silly. Why? Was it thirsty? How was the weekend? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, the weekend was actually very good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Little paddleboarding, little golf. Life's good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're really utilizing Malibu. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm trying to. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I like it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All I want to do is get a little helicopter time in. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to go over there one day and watch. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? Fly it. You can't be a spectator in life. You have to be a participant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I also enjoy watching. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can watch and participate. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 'Cause I feel like I learn from watching. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can also learn more from doing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So let's do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's what I like to hear. Want a carrot stick, Mase? &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Celery stick? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh, celery bite! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So how have you been doing, considering the loss of your parents? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, uh... it's baffling that this is the life that we live and it happens to everybody, you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I don't think anything would get anybody prepared. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's devastating, 'cause that part of your life is over. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, it's the worst. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just hard when you pick up the phone and you go to make a phone call and... you just can't, you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Family-wise, you're kind of stuck with us, huh? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's terrible. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Out of the frying pan and into the fire. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, big time. It's a lot to handle sometimes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Absolutely. When you lose a parent, it's really tough. And I can't even imagine losing both parents within a... such a short amount of time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But... it's been good to have the support, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So... Thank God for everybody. But my... you know, the kids are the most important. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got our eye on you. Yeah, we're watching. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Want me to cut you a piece, Mase? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yes. Cut all of it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bite. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Aw, seeing Scott cut Mason's food for him does my heart good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's my boy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've come a long way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love this guy. He's my best friend. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: North was hysterically laughing today. Like, all... for so long, like an hour. We were just laying down on this mat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: But she has got to learn how to, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To crawl? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...to crawl. She just likes it when there's, like, a hard surface and then a mat. The rug, she, like, gets too sidetracked, 'cause it's, like, fluffy, so she... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...still gets it in her mouth, and she'll just go like this. Like different time, you know? Like, trying to get it out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim and I have decided to do a mud run obstacle course. It's supposed to be, like, a fun and, like, healthy workout weekend thing. Yeah! We're here! So Kim set up this hike today to prep ourselves. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's a beautiful day. Let's do this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, blaze a trail. &gt;&gt; ROB: Just go through here. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. Come on, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This girl thinks she fuego. &gt;&gt; KIM: Guys, pick up the pace. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're on a leisurely stroll. &gt;&gt; KIM: Guys, come on. Can you not keep up with me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I could keep up with you. &gt;&gt; ROB: You guys, this is the dumbest workout circuit I've ever seen. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna run into our asses. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He was thrusting us from behind. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone do a squat in between the stairs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You think you're hot , don't you? It seems like Kim set up this hike to kind of showcase her energy, 'cause she is moving and grooving. All Kim does is talk about fitness and what she's eating. I just feel like everything kind of is a competition. So, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm dying to hear about your psychic. &gt;&gt; KIM: The psychic told me... &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: ..."you cry yourself to sleep at night." &gt;&gt; ROB: Which is what she probably says already. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She could Google that. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it was really good. She said, work-wise, what's happening for me, and I'm gonna get pregnant really soon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ah. Am I gonna have any kids? &gt;&gt; KIM: She said you should get a sperm donor, but that will come later. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. That's what she said? &gt;&gt; KIM: I was like, absolutely not. She said you like North the best. &gt;&gt; ROB: Of course. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, she said you should get a puppy. And you're not bipolar. I asked her. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you find this as annoying... &gt;&gt; KRIS: She ruined it. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...or comic? This is called the Baby Shusher. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to get that for Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can't say "shh" yourself? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, not that long. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do it every night. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I'm sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, you have to be calming. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, it's more like "shh, shh, shh, shh, shh... shh!" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Has anybody seen the Wolf of Wall Street? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not I, said the cat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: First of all, I have a white Lambo, so that was exciting for me. But now I need to get a chopper in the backyard, just like they had. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's so dangerous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey! Hey! Hey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He almost crashes it into the pool... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But they land. He was drunk! You probably would like that I want to get a helicopter in the backyard, don't you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How sick would it be? And we could put a copter pad... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll put one in the back of mine... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Huh? We could fly over. I'm into anything luxurious, obviously, and I'm realizing: I think I got enough room for a helipad. I mean, who needs all the traffic? I don't need it. I'd rather just fly away like a little bird. That's what I need. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You going to fly it, or are you gonna hire somebody? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I have you! Bruce, did you not remember that you're a pilot? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You want me to fly for you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah! 'Cause for you it's a hobby, for me it's a luxury. So it works out perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got yourself a pilot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I'm talking about, Bruce. I'm gonna take my chopper everywhere I want to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't get carried away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob, do you want to come over? &gt;&gt; ROB: Great. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa. That is, like, really up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: When you know he's going home with Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all... Yeah, he's going home with me, he's not going home with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine. Khloe wants to hang out with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've been a bad girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop! Ow, Khloe, that hurts. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yeah. Khloe... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're such a... ow, wait. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh, that's my penis! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, Grandma, ow. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, Chicago! Oh, God. This is like jail cell &gt;&gt; ROB: Come on. Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not cool. &gt;&gt; ROB: She's just... Khloe, it's over. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not over until the fat lady sings. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, start singing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh! Burn! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you like the jumpsuit? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, it's cute. Where are we going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I want to go look at some luggage. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Um, so Scott will not stop talking to me about wanting to put a helicopter pad in the backyard. And I just feel like it's so dangerous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, I thought it was a joke. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to go by aviation rules. You have to get permits. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My neighbor told me that her husband wanted to get one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But it's your house. It's not an airport. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want him to get it, I'm saying... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not gonna have, in the middle of the night... It would wake up all the neighbors and your children and half of Calabasas. I just think he's got... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I also don't want to tell him no to everything, like you did with Bruce. You took away his plane, you took away his house in Tahoe... &gt;&gt; KRIS: The airplane was because we couldn't afford an airplane anymore. When Bruce and I started dating, Bruce had a lot of toys. He had Jet Skis and motorboats and snowmobiles and a house on Lake Tahoe. But the truth is we owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes. We didn't have any money. We had four kids to take care of and another one on the way. The fact that I was the one who went and cleaned up the mess, I should've gotten a medal for that. So I had to be the practical one and get rid of some of these crazy expenses. You're talking about a helicopter. It costs so much money in maintenance and hangar fees, and what about your future? You just bought a crazy 13,000-square-foot home. I think in any relationship, one person is sort of the voice of reason. And I think that means spending money on things that are beneficial to the whole family. So Kourtney really needs to take care of this helicopter pad situation. You have two kids to send to college. Think it's irresponsible and financially not smart. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Heliport Consultants. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Perfect. Come on down. I got to get this chopper pad moving along. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: When you're looking at the property, it's about the flight path, how to get out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think you're gonna make it out then in the middle of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think this is what I should wear to the mud run? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim just thinks she's such a hottie McFottie. I'm definitely gonna beat her. I'm gonna shove her face in the mud. I'm good at an obstacle course. Are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Showtime, baby! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruiser! What are you doing? Oh, the simulator? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Simulator. Yeah, you can't do this without a simulator. You wind up crashing all the time, this and that. But you start to get an idea of what it's supposed to do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'd like to get one of these all diamonded out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get the tail facing... No, the other way. Perfect. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you guys doing on that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're getting our heli on here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's it, that's it. Good, good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: As fun as these radio controlled helicopters are with Bruce, I'm not trying to get sucked into his weird fetish. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa! Oh, got a little excited there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying to get a real deal, big boy chopper that you can get in. And I want it in my backyard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good start? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. I think we're getting there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye. See you later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should we go outside? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why not? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. So, we're gonna take this hedge out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, please. It's disgusting. Just look at these decrepit little edges. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, be careful! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, seriously, I... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I want you to live on the edge. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just show... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, I just told you! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. Ow! What the?! This is, uh, this hurts. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It should. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna need two Band-Aids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You should take care of me now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All righty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, I was thinking that I would let you decide if you want to put your helicopter pad out here or not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you sure this isn't reverse psychology you're trying to pull on me? 'Cause you've done it before. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whatever. I'm just saying you could do it if you want to. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like you're trying to reverse, so now I'm not gonna do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to give you... It's in your hands. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you think it's a good idea to put a chopper pad in your backyard, go for it. Obviously I would care if we had a helipad in our backyard, but Scott has been really depressed. I don't want to, like, kill his joy, and I don't want to be the boss telling him exactly what to do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I appreciate you coming to your senses. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, if you're saying yes to that, I mean, there's some other things I'd like to get going, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-mm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll take the chopper pad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you ever done this type of workout? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have no idea what it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's like these... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wraps? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...wraps that are hanging from the ceiling, and you're doing, like, aerial tricks. I did it for this photo shoot I did for Lam. I just thought it was so fun. I don't know. Do something new. Kourt and I are about to take this aerial yoga lesson, and I heard it is amazing for strength training. When I work out, I'm, like, hard-core and full throttle. And I need anything that will give me an extra edge over Kim in this mud run. You know Kim and I are doing that mud run? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is a mud run? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like obstacle courses and you have to run certain amounts of time and, like, it's in the mud. It's like you get down and dirty, but Kim is getting so competitive about it. Shocker. Kim is being incredibly competitive, which is annoying me. She's just like, "Did you work out today? What did you do?" Like, she's egging me on, and she's just, like, taking this to a whole other level. I mean, I think Kim should know better than to mess with me. Now I totally have to kick her ass. I would love to see how you get down and dirty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aerial classroom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh! Ready to rock and roll. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; JESSICA: Hi! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: I'm Jessica. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Kourtney. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: We're gonna start learning how to climb. First, pick a leg, wrap it around the fabric. My other foot is gonna step up, pinching that fabric. From here, I'm gonna reach up. I'm gonna try and lift my knees up, knees, step on my feet, and stand up. Okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if we have no upper body strength? &gt;&gt; JESSICA: I'm gonna spot you. I'm gonna help you the first time. Then we're gonna try and add some tricks to it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want to do it first? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't do a somersault. I think I'm gonna break my neck. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: And try to find your balance if you're comfortable. You don't have to take your hands off, though. Okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so... &gt;&gt; JESSICA: Wrap your leg around, lift that knee up. Step and stand. Good! Keep this foot flexed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You could do it. You got to get ready to beat Kim. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: Push. Just a little more so it's not on your knee. Roll through. Can you find your balance? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You could do it. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: Good. Can you take one hand off? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My &gt;&gt; JESSICA: You want to get it, like, right between your boobs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lady, I can't do two. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: That's okay. You did it. You didn't think you could and you got it all the way through. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I did it. Sticky hand five. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: Reach over your head and split the two pieces. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Watch again, guys. Okay. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: So, we're just gonna do a little spin. That's it. Good. Plant your feet down. Make sure you're not too dizzy before you walk away. I'm gonna do a trick that's called "Man in the Moon." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's no way we're doing that. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: Climb. Yes, yes! Hook your legs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good job, Kourt! &gt;&gt; JESSICA: You need to hook those knees-- that's it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your butt looks so good. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: That's it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...you are with me. You are so good at this. It's so scary. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: Good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is my calling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: I'm gonna have you actually give me one leg, and you can... push off me to get your other one up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: Keep going. Good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:a duck. &gt;&gt; JESSICA: There you go. You got it. You-you did it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You've got something on Kim. She doesn't have any of this talent for the mud run. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This isn't gonna help for the mud run. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? I thought you said it's an obstacle course. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. Scott. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: I'm Ricarda Bennett. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Heliport Consultants. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Perfect. Come on down. Let's get consulting. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did you find it okay? &gt;&gt; RICARDA: I... Perfect, not... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You didn't get lost between all the mansions? &gt;&gt; RICARDA: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We just moved up here, so we don't have any furniture. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: That's... I understand. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I just figure, you know, living out here in the valley opposed to the city, it may be better for me to have a chopper to get to, you know, Vegas, Santa Barbara, Orange County, the airport. Nowhere far, obviously. I'm not trying to get... &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Are you, are you a pilot? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, no, no, no, no. I can barely drive a car. I would have a pilot. Yeah. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Okay. That's a good idea, then. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. We can look at the back. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, it's not every day that Kourtney takes the backseat into some of the crazier ideas that I have. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: I have some good stuff to show you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Great! I know I have a small window here, so I got to get this chopper pad moving along. Have you done a lot of home helipads? &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Actually some, but not a lot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Mostly, um, hospitals, corporations. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: So, first of all I want to explain a little bit about the flight path. They fly very much like planes. So, in other words, when you're looking at the property, it's how to get out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Okay, this is the helipad and over here is the transitional slope. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think you're gonna make it out then in the middle of here. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Exactly. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think we're gonna have to go more along the lines of here to get a straight path out. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Possibly. Possibly. We... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm fine with that. I-I would look out my kitchen window to a chopper. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, let's discuss this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: A good client is an educated client. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Educate me! &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Okay. So we have to have... This means... this is all obstruction-free. 'Cause that means... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll knock some trees out if I have to. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: ...no trees, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't give a &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Okay, so this gives... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That tree may have to go out, right? &gt;&gt; RICARDA: I think so. Yeah, and the... also... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruiser! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was summoned over here for what reason? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here's the man. He is gonna be my pilot. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Hi. Ricarda. Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bruce. How are you doing? Bruce. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Thank you, fine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So she does, uh, helipads. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah, helipads and stuff? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just can't believe Kourtney is gonna let you do this. This is amazing. I mean, I could never get Kris on board with something like this, especially putting this big helicopter in the backyard. It would... never would've worked. I'm kind of shocked. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: I think this is the best site. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's most important to find out first? FAA? Or should I call my homeowners' before I... I start plowing my dri... my lawn? &gt;&gt; RICARDA: I think the most important is dealing with the homeowners' association. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If you get approvals there, then you can go to the FAA... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...and say, we got this approval, we got that approval, the house is on a point. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: And you want to be prepared to tell them... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: ...why we want to do it, and that's... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think if they ask me why, I'd say, "'Cause I can." Is that gonna work? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That-that doesn't work, that doesn't work. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: That doesn't work. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wow, you gotta really grease these people up. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: Well, not exactly. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll walk in there with a bottle of KY, start squirting it everywhere. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no. &gt;&gt; RICARDA: We have to have a different approach. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to get this pad more than anybody. If I need to... What is this? My chopper's landing! Nope. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Calm down. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is that? I gotta get one of these. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Say "KoKo." &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: KoKo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yay! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: P, say "gotta go." &gt;&gt; KIM: Gotta go. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Go! &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at P! Look at P in her boots! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KIM: Those are good boots. You like it? &gt;&gt; MASON: Now put on this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know Kanye got me those? &gt;&gt; MASON: KoKo, putting on the shoes! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mase... Can you walk in those? Mase, you're gonna fall. &gt;&gt; MASON: Look, KiKi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good job, Mase! You can walk in high heels, honey. Show your mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase... &gt;&gt; KIM: Say "KiKi." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, look. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think this is what I should wear to the mud run? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you kidding? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why would I be kidding? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't wear that. Your boobs are out. Maybe that's your plan, is to, like, distract everyone? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have a question. Have you been training for this thing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I work out regularly. I, you know, go on runs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim just thinks she's such a hottie McFottie. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've been mixing up my workouts, really trying to get prepared for this mud run. I just want to prove that I can do this. I can beat her. There's no competition. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, I'm good at an obstacle course. Are you? I am very confident in my intense workout skills, so I'm definitely gonna beat her and I'm gonna shove her face in the mud. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying to buy a helicopter for my backyard. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Ah, lovely. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Holy... I want a whole fleet of L.D.-uniformed humans. This just makes sense. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've actually been waiting for this moment since I started the race, so I could go ham on this girl. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe... &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Good morning, sir. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm good, how are you doing? Bruce. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: John. We've met before. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where? &gt;&gt; MOWATT: At Van Nuys Airport. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, probably. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Yes, sir. I was fortunate enough to teach, uh... Brandon? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, did you work up with Brandon? Yes. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, okay, yeah. You're the British guy with the... yeah, you've been doing this forever, he told me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is like the same size as your radio-controlled. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: How are you, sir? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is Scott. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Good to meet you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying to buy a helicopter for my backyard. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Ah, lovely. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This thing is awesome. That must be a little nerve-wracking. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's like it's... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's got a seat belt. You're not gonna fall out. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Yeah, it's a motorbike. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Holy... Lord of the Rings. This is like Lord of the Air. Makes me think I want to hire more staff. I want a whole fleet of L.D.-uniformed humans. This just makes sense. That's a cutie. But I need something a little bigger, I think. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, Scott. This is the-the 44. They sell more than any other helicopter in the world. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is this good for a backyard? &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Well, I've got several people that land in, uh, Malibu. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: At their house? &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that's awesome. What are we looking at for this? &gt;&gt; MOWATT: This one, if you get a new one, it's 650, 700, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The real question is, how long it would take from my backyard to Vegas? &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Where is your backyard? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Calabasas. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Calabasas. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Okay. Oh, hour and a half. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Eh, hour and a half. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's not terrible. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Could you fly this, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, yeah, I'd have to get... get my checkride done in it, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's the chopper. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I agree. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's a lot of money to fork out, but in the long run, it pays off. I mean, it's a good balance. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Well, I totally agree, especially for me. Uh... No, honestly, Scott, I'm proud of you for kind of pursuing this. I love that Kourtney's going along with this. You're doing a good job. You know, Scott and his whole family situation, he's been pretty down lately. And it's good to see him get excited about something. Going over and looking at helicopters? Man, a guy who loves toys? Me and him? There's nothing better. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: How 'bout we have a demo fly and see if you like it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, let's go. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: I'm the one that'll do it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And by the way, you know, in London they call me Lord Disick. &gt;&gt; MOWATT: Oh... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Lord of the manor. L.D. Air is what we're gonna go for, here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ah, today is the day of the mud run. Ah! It's so nervous, 'cause I've never done something like this before, but I'm excited Kim and I get to do this together and I'm even more excited that I get to prove to Kim, once and for all, that she's not the only fit one in the family anymore. We're here! I am so competitive with you that you have me doing this &gt;&gt; KIM: It is freezing... &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Chest bump! &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, don't. Don't. Your chest is made of steel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've got bigger than me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my back really hurts. Ow. I am so prepared for this. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, I'm dizzy. That was a lot for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really do think that I have a chance to beat Khloe on this. I'm gonna write KiKi, you write KoKo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I'm gonna write KoKo. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, once you become a mom, you're just stronger at everything. My weight today: 125. One-twenty-five. Pre-baby, I was 130. My strategy was just going to be to get on your back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What am I, a mule? I'm not, like, a horse. Oh, my God, you burped in your own face 'cause of that thing. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Okay, girls, you ready? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Born ready. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Stand in line this way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Born ready! &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, stop. We're not doing that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, the race hasn't even started yet, and Kim is already crying. Wah, wah, wah. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: All right, I need you all to count down with me. You ready? We'll just go by five, all right? We're gonna start by five. Here we go, as loud as you can, all right? Five! &gt;&gt; ALL: Four! Three! Two! One! &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Oh, yeah, go, let's go... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Jump. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's see who can stay the cleanest. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Anyone else want to walk? I mean, I've seen Kim work out. I've worked out with Kim. Kim works out in a mild form, compared to me. Catch my breath a little. I work out with a vengeance, I have a purpose in there, and I love to sweat. So going into this mud run I knew that Kim is gonna be, like, very lax about it. Yeah... Oh! Need a break. Holyballs. I'll crawl down. And a mile in, I was right. She's already whining and wanting to cut through the course. Oh, my God, you are... &gt;&gt; KIM: Kind of tired. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My shoe came off! &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe lost her shoe in the mud and I hope this works to my advantage, because I need all the help I can get. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Got you the new pilot outfit, Bruiser, before we get the chopper up and running in the backyard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys could crash. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hold on. When we first got married and I had the airplane, you loved it. Are you saying I'm getting old and I can't handle it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think I'm controlling? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: When it comes to Daddy? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I can see where he's coming from, 'cause you have a really strong personality. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My shoe came off! &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe lost her shoe in the mud, and I hope this works to my advantage because I need all the help I can get. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But what do I do...? I've actually been waiting for her just to touch me in an inappropriate way, so I could go ham on this girl. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Man up a little bit, okay? That's pretty funny. Say "Church." Who's the best competitor in the world? Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: Get off me... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is it okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...you beast. Let's see this body builder. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She called me a beast. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have realized I just cannot beat Khloe. Like, there's just nothing that I can do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna get a serious yeast infection sitting in this wetness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your ass looks good in mud though. &gt;&gt; KIM: At this point, I just want to get through this race without Khloe body-slamming me one more time. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, keep going, keep going! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! We're doing our mud run there. Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't trust you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not gonna push you. I mean, we've already started the race, now we're both filthy and cold. There's nothing else we could do but, you know, laugh at ourselves and enjoy the race and have fun doing it. Oh, my God! Aah! &gt;&gt; MAN: Yes, yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's go, Kim! Good job, KiKi! &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The amount of dirt that's in my vagina... I'm so disgusted. What? We have to go in that pool thing? I really can't believe we got ourselves into this. This is, like, ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where, where are we...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Our competitive streak, like, went too far. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, Kim and I are so competitive with one another, but we don't do a lot of down and dirty stuff together. We're in it together, kid. &gt;&gt; KIM: Keeks and Kokes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, I'm loving just spending the day with Keeks and having some sister-sister time. How did we stop? I don't understand. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We did it! &gt;&gt; KIM: We did it! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That scraped my butt! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I won't, I won't. Me, too. Thank you. Okay, bye. Anesthesiologist. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: For what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: For my, um, I'm getting my teeth fixed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your seat? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, "my teeth." I should get my seat fixed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruiser! Just the man I was looking for. Excuse me, don't talk to my pilot like that. L.D. Air. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Got you the new pilot outfit, Bruiser, for when we get the chopper up and running in the backyard, helipad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Lord Disick Air? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. Did you get a helicopter? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're working on the chopper, but I figure if my pilot has his uniform, the chopper's got to come next. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe that Kourtney hasn't confronted Scott and talked some sense into him yet. You can't just fly him around in a helicopter that... You guys are gonna crash. I think when it comes to boys and their toys, the boys aren't always the most practical. And sometimes guys don't realize how everything adds up. Just a few things can be more than a mortgage every month. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I-I've gotten, like, 6,000 hours of flying time over my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In an airplane, not in a helicopter. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not a lot in helicopters, but I'll go back and get... All I got to do is the type rating. It's, like, 15 hours of flying and then you can get your rating. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're gonna get free rides, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel... I don't want a free ride. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hold it-- when we first got married and I had the airplane, you were, like, all over it. You loved it. You were flying everywhere. We were even doing stuff in the back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He had sex with me in the back of a plane and nobody was flying it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Autopilot? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nice, Bruiser. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That-That's not good judgment. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's the real mile high club. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is getting a little too intense, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You trusted me then. Why wouldn't you trust me? Are you saying I'm getting old and I can't handle it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, instincts aren't the same. Your reflexes might not... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everything's... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Watch me. See that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Quick as hell. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: See? I just go boom! He looks over. Boom! He looked again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is a dangerous job, it's a dangerous job. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: By the way, there was a more dangerous job that he took on a long time ago, and that was marrying... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That was marrying her! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Exactly! Hit me again, Bruiser. So, trust me... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hand hug? Hand hug! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hand hug! &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, well, have fun with your little costume on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: "Costume"? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe you can wear that on Halloween. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's calling it a costume. You're jealous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's crazy, right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It really is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Can I show you something outside? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me show you what the pool guy made for me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, that's it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let them enjoy their... She's so jealous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. Honestly. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I actually saw this last night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The little fence? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, and were these stepping stones always here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: For, like, the last year. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It looks good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why in the world would you let Scott do a helicopter pad on your property? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, we had this conversation. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Mama. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but I think it's so bizarre. I thought you were gonna tell him no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi! We had this conversation. I said I don't want to... I'm, like, I'm not making his decision. I'm not, like, being bossy like you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I mean... eh, it's not about being bossy, it's about making intelligent decisions, and it's a piece of property and an investment. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's an adult, and I'm not... Like, he's free to do whatever he wants. Like, he can make his decision on his own. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's gonna take up a huge amount of property in your backyard, and you're gonna look out there and see a big, you know, circle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just think that it needs to be his decision. I don't want to forever scar him and he resents me. My mom has been telling Bruce what to do for years and years, and it makes Bruce resentful. So I definitely don't want to be in that situation, either. I'm not gonna put limitations on things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's taking up a little bit more of the yard than I thought. Do you think things are gonna start getting thrown into the pool? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah. It will throw some things around. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is tough. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want to apologize if you feel like I shut you down on things that you wanted to do because I said no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruiser, I want to show you where the chopper pad's been marked off to. So, it's taking up a little bit more of the yard than I thought. Truthfully, I thought we were gonna knock this tree out, dig the property out a little, and put it over there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can't dig the property 'cause it's so steep on the other side. You got to keep it on this side. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You think things are gonna start getting thrown into the pool? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah. I would have a cover for the pool, you know? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. I mean, this would look mighty pretty with a chopper right here just living the dream. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Nothing better than a good helicopter, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But it could be a bit of an eyesore for the backyard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is tough. I just don't want it to affect the whole house, and then I'm thinking, "Is it gonna start spraying everything into the yard?" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it-it-it-it will throw some things around. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, seeing the plans for the helipad in the backyard is definitely giving me second thoughts. It's gonna take up, like, half my yard and it's probably hazardous towards my kids. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's got to be your decision on what you do, but could it be done? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here's the thing about the little kids running around. I don't know if I can risk it. Should I put the kids up for adoption? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'll take them. I'm good at raising kids. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Chopper, kids... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa, what's going on in here? I've never seen your room quite this crazy. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. I'm sorry. I'm packing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're, like, the neat freak. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. This isn't normal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hmm. You're gonna clean it up before you leave, right? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me ask you a question 'cause it's been bothering me all night, like, I was up in the middle of the night thinking about it. Do you think I'm controlling... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...when it comes to Daddy? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I can see where he's coming from when he says that. 'Cause you have a really strong personality, and you like to pe... you like people to do things your way, and you like to tell them what to do. I mean, that's fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm-I'm very definite for sure. I just think I figured it out, and I want everybody else to be on my bandwagon. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I-I think he takes me the wrong way sometimes. You know, I'm strong. But I can be very overwhelming. I know I can. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I... I need to work on that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is that why you think you two separated? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I think, I mean, he definitely knows the way I am and has lived with me for-- as he'll tell you... : ...over a quarter of a century. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I think that people just sometimes grow apart. We still love each other. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I feel you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we still are family. It's just that sometimes people need a break from each other. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney said she doesn't want to be like me. And she doesn't want to have that same relationship with Scott that I have with Bruce. You know, I feel bad about the way that maybe I came on too strong, and tried to swoop in and fix things. At the end of the day, I hope Bruce doesn't resent me for that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, okay, are you gonna show me? No... Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No! &gt;&gt; MASON: I'll come and show you how I slide down. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, okay, are you gonna show me? No... Oh, my God! That is the coolest slide I've ever seen. &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm going in. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you coming out this way? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yes! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you? So cool. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me see... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you in there, Mason? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yay! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa. Why don't you take the cardboard with you all the way up to the top, and then you put your butt on that and slide down on it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a great place for a slide. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, instead of the chopper, we went with a slide. A little bit more kid friendly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And a lot less expensive. &gt;&gt; MASON: Daddy! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you're not kidding. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, at the end of the day, it would've been nice to have the chopper pad and the heli that landed on it, but, you know, having children, sometimes you got to compromise. I'm actually happy that Kourtney let me make the decision on my own, and she didn't push me into getting rid of the chopper idea and getting some slides. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the coolest thing ever. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mom! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ah, I hear somebody. Is somebody in there? Is this the most awesome thing you've ever seen? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is incredible. This is great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you go down it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, but I went up and looked, it's steep up at the top. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mase, do you think it's too dangerous to bring North in? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yes, it is. Yeah, it's too scary for her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MASON: It's a little dark. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's get an extra tube and put it in the pool! &gt;&gt; MASON: KoKo, you want to go back up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can't we go this way? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like this worked out to be a little bit more practical than the helipad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Give or take. &gt;&gt; MASON: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You think? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Go! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go, go! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This was a really good decision and it's not quite as loud as a helicopter pad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so exciting, Mason. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mase, would you rather a helipad or the slide? &gt;&gt; MASON: I don't know what a helipad is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's where a helicopter lands. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's honest. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa! So cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at those, like, Greek pillars. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, this house here is a destroyed house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What happened to it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: N-Nobody has ever taken care of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? It looks like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's been sitting there for 20 years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe we could get it and fix it. That would be a project. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That'd be a fun beach house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ready? Jump. Nice day, huh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. So, speaking of fixing things, I had this conversation with Kourtney. You know how Scott wanted a helicopter and a helicopter pad in the backyard? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah, well, boy, do I? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I was like, "Shut thatdown. You know, don't let him have a helicopter pad in the house." And she went completely the opposite of what I told her to do. Like, Kourtney said, "I don't do things and handle Scott a certain way because of the way you were with Bruce." Do you think I'm that crazy controlling? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Of course! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel horrible that you guys think that I'm that bad. I don't want to be a crazy bitch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think I'm that crazy controlling? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Of course! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel horrible that you guys think that I'm that bad. I don't want to be a crazy bitch. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not that you're a bad person or anything. It's just you have a kind of a dominant personality, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I recognize it more when my kids pointed out to me that they don't want to be like me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it's not that nobody loves you-- they all love you-- but it's just the way you handle things, you know? Take the Porsche. I went to the Porsche place, I saw the car, I drove it out, showed it to you, you go, "Absolutely no." And I go, "I agree." I wasn't into it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wanted to surprise you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's you controlling things. You know? And I think that's what the kids are, you know, complaining about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I guess I just looked at it as a really fun, huge surprise, and I didn't think about it that way. I feel bad that I was a little strong and controlling. I still feel like I made the right choices but I feel bad about my approach, and I am mature enough and big enough to admit it. I just want to apologize if you feel like I shut you down on things that you wanted to do because I said no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You don't have to apologize. It would be good if you let go a little bit more and let people make mistakes, let 'em do it their way, all that kind of stuff. That's all good. I think in time it'll come as you get older. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, good. So when I'm 150, I'm gonna be perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, no, when you hit about 60. Yeah, yeah. You're gonna be mellowed out and all that kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But you're not a bad person. You have good intentions. You have good intentions. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel really guilty for things that happened in the past but I got to apologize, and it's really a relief to feel like Bruce doesn't hold certain things against me. I think that other things have caused Bruce and I to grow apart, but the good news is we'll always be really good friends. Well, I'm sorry if you guys take me that way 'cause I don't mean to be that way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just, you know... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We'll forgive you. Live with you? Eh... I don't know. Forgive you? Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS:Well, that's good. One out of two ain't bad. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's a father-son golf tournament coming up. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The thing that's been tough is getting Brody to commit to something. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You put the energy out there like I'm lazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been reaching out for the last few years, and it's easier with Brandon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to call the police immediately. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In the middle of my move, I just discover that someone took the majority of Lamar's jewelry. &gt;&gt; OFFICER: They were here? These two? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. I now have to question and look at the people that I let into my home. So vulnerable already. Who took my?
