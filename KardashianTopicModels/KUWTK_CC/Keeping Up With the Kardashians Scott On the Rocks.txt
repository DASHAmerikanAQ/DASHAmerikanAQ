- &gt;&gt; KIM: It's been a wild year for me and my family. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Will you marry me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: In case you hadn't heard, Khloe got married. &gt;&gt; MINISTER: From this day forward, you are husband and wife. Whoo! My older sister's pregnant and she's living with her boyfriend Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's our baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: And Reggie and I have decided to spend some time apart. I hate being single! Coming up this season on <i>Keeping</i> <i>Up With the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: Leave her alone! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's your baby shower and you're ahour late, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to have babies. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you trying to get pregnant? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you want your dress back, you will listen to the following instructions. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We used to have sex every single day and now it's like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I can't catch a break. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're not even into it yet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ugh, go in your room! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So I came up with this idea that we'll have a charity boxing event with the family. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? Bust if off! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not what we signed up for. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is about as dumb as you've gotten. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just can't believe she doesn't remember what we had. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll either call the police, or you don't spend time with her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, come on, he's brainwashing you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it, Scott. Stop it. I hate him. That is so beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, is this your wedding footage? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Didn't you just live this? You need to watch it already? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, I'm watching it. Get over it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not on it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When are we going to sit and open up all your gifts? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: As soon as I get a a house. Hey, Jooge. Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kimmie. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just got back. After the wedding, I've just been doing a lot of thinking about my life and my relationship. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's some food in the kitchen. Go grab yourself a plate. &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie and I broke up 'cause we were just having a really hard time trying to spend time together. Of course I want to make it work, but we both, like, don't know if we even have the time or we want to spend the time to commit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're a bold pregnant woman to be wearing sheer lace when you're jumbo. And those boobs are like uncontrollable. Control those suckers. What is wrong with you? Normally you would think that is like the funniest thing. Honestly you can't be this depressed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're depressed about Reggie? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kimmie, don't be sad. You're going to have a wedding just as pretty as this one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. &gt;&gt; KIM: I definitely feel a little bit of pressure now that Khloe's married, Kourtney's having a baby. You know, I've always had my plan. And right now, I don't have a plan. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I just think everybody has to not put so much pressure on Kim, Including my... &gt;&gt; KIM: You're the one that puts the pressure on me! You're the one telling me that I'm going to have a wedding just like this! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want her to be happy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But she's happy on her own. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't need to get married. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She doesn't need to get married. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm fine. You guys all make me feel like I'm the one that has to get married and have a baby. I'm fine! And can't we get rid of this wedding cake already? It's been here for a week. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not doing anything to you. Jealous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look what you did, you little jerk. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everything's not always my fault. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're just a desperate woman. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That pushes her children to get married. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's not pushing me to get married. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, well, well. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mrs. Odem. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. Sorry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, governor. Whoa. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. Gifts-- honestly, they do not stop coming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, they're everywhere. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you feel like this is frustrating for you, I live here right now. I'm claustrophobic. It's a lot. Lamar and I are living at a hotel right now, because we have not found a house together yet. Kourtney, please stop. Look at the comparison from her shoe to his shoe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're gonna get these gifts delivered. Put this stuff in my car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And all the future stuff is going to come straight to our house, and that's where your gifts will be until you guys find someplace to live. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is honestly-- this will help me out so much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, pay attention. Let's go have some lunch! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look who you're &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, I'm out of here-- let's go. You guys are giving me a migraine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love to cook, I love to bake and I also love just to like make a house a home. I don't want to be in a hotel. I want to build memories and be, like, this is our first dinner here. Like, this is the first time I did your laundry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to get organized and get house hunting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know; it just sucks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys have to find someplace to live. You can't live in a hotel for the rest of your life. Khloe's really young, and she doesn't necessarily know what she's doing. So I think that I'm really well qualified to help her find the perfect house. Why don't you and I go, and we'll pick out some things, and so he's got choices. And you can get organized. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys, can you all please be nice to Scott, 'cause this is, like his, giving you guys a chance. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm never too mean to him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're not, but... I want my family to just treat Scott with respect. My mom treats Scott like he is hired helper. If Lamar comes over, she doesn't ask him to do anything. It's only Scott. What are you making for dinner? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Spaghetti. Scott, you can help me over here. Who wants something? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, Bruce wants some. Rob, you want a little plate? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I'm on a diet. Do you want to waste food? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've seen this in the movies, how you take plates. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where's the sauce? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't mess around, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, but I've seen people do it. This is like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott I told you! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was trying to help. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Those are my new dishes! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was trying to help. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now the spaghetti's all over the kitchen! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, he's trying to help. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not helping, okay? I don't mean to be rude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are being rude. So whether you mean to or not, you are. You need to learn what the is important in life, and it's not about a plate. I don't think it's fair the way everyone treats Scott. You know, Scott is the father of my baby, so they have to get along with him, or else they're not going to be involved. If you guys don't start being nice to Scott, we're not going to come here. I don't need to come here. You don't need to see my child. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Scott. I lost my temper. I'm sorry, I really am. Thank you for trying to help me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scottie. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruce, how the hell are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. What are you up to? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's hot out. Have to take a little dip in your pool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, well, enjoy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I will. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just cleaning up my little helicopter. Where's Kourtney? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, at the office. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Working hard for her money. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Scott-- you know, nice guy, but he's not motivated and he doesn't have direction. He just kind of wanders through life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Trying to figure out why Scott's outside laying out by the pool oiling up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't figure the guy out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honestly, he needs to get a job. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I agree. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's really bugging me. You know, maybe he just needs jump starting his motivation. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You give motivational speeches for a living. Go out there and give him a speech, about how his... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not going to work. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...future grandmother of his child is going kick his ass if he doesn't get going here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Laziness is in his DNA. &gt;&gt; KRIS: As a mom, I just want the best for my daughter, and I think Scott really needs to step it up. I need somebody... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it's Kourtney's responsibility to talk to him, not mine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, obviously, Kourtney is a little preoccupied right now. She's almost nine months pregnant. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm preoccupied... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And the father of her child is out there laying in the sun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hon, I'm preoccupied, too-- I have to go work on my short game. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, great. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right there, baby. Just keep it on plane-- boom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're like the blind leading the blind. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guess I'll go back to work, since I'm the only one who does. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Kourt, I wanted to hang out with you, go to the movies with you the other day. I mean, you flaked on me three times, like, come on. Now that Scott's back in the picture, it's just not the same. I barely see Kourtney. I think Scott is threatened by our relationship and how close we are. So that's kind of frustrating these days. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo, just 'cause you and Lamar aren't together 24-seven, like we are, don't get jealous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I never see you anymore, ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, 'cause you need an attitude adjustment. Every time I see you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. I have the same attitude I've always had. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...Khloe, every time I see you, are you not rude to Scott? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will cut your balls off, capisce? He's a bull You need to break up with him. What have you done so far to prove that you are capable of having a child and taking care of another life? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't need to prove anything to any of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what, Kourt, I'm so disappointed in you. I think this is disgusting. I think he is disgusting. I want nothing to do with him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He deserves it. &gt;&gt; KIM: If I came around and I was just like, "Lamar, myleft" Like I hate you, and if I was to just gave Lamar an attitude, what would you do? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I'm back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, babe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't wear those pants every single day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, they're comfortable. Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to lunch with Lisa. We're going to go to Katsuya. Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I guess I'm here by myself, huh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, no. Scott's still sunbathing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just, I'm not a Scott fan-- at all. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott is the father of the child, so you'd better get used to that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not going to get used to it. You know what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're going to drive her away and your grandchild. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, then she's going to be over there with somebody who's not motivated, who doesn't have a job, who doesn't have anything to do in life, who doesn't get up every day and isn't excited, you know? And I'm-- why am I the only one that notices there's something weird about this whole thing? It's weird! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've just got to get used to it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's not motivated enough to take care of my grandchild, then he doesn't deserve that responsibility. He needs to get it together. And I don't have to get used to anything. Got it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have a nice lunch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where theis my car? &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, we're done, guys, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: The last thing I want to do right now is go and take pictures and try and be sexy. I don't feel sexy. I don't feel cute. I don't want to be here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not who you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not even funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't leave! I'm just kidding! No, just don't... &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't touch her! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? I like the entrance here, Khloe. &gt;&gt; AGENT: More parking spaces in the back as far as parking goes, which is great. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so excited to go house hunting today, but Lamar can't be here because he's in practice. &gt;&gt; AGENT: The house pretty much speaks for itself. It's just over 10,000 square feet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Very cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could you see yourself living in a house? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, but there's another person who is this high who needs to come and go, "Okay, I like this house, too." Oh, I'm so nervous! This is my first wifely duty, and I really don't want to disappoint Lamar. &gt;&gt; AGENT: The house is brand-new; it's just under 8,000 square feet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like the water climb. Trying to find the right home, I didn't realize how stressful and exhausting it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now which way do we go? &gt;&gt; AGENT: This is the maid's room over over here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Got it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have never bought a house before, so I'm relying on my mom who knows a lot more about house stuff than I do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This area is a little small. &gt;&gt; AGENT: Feels forced? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know it's out there. I feel it in my heart, like I it when I walk into a house, I'm gonna know when it just feels right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, I'm gonna find you the house of your dreams. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This place is a mess. Oh, Kim, it <i>reeks</i> in here. I walk into Kim's apartment, and the stench is ridiculous. And she looks like she's a mess. &gt;&gt; KIM: I put on makeup today. That's a first step. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look like a slob, to put it mildly, and this place is... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, what? I deserve to be a slob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, this is how people live when they're, like, really depressed. &gt;&gt; KIM: So maybe I'm really depressed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I appreciate that you're going through a rough time, I really do, but you don't miss business meetings. &gt;&gt; KIM: What meeting? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The meeting about your perfume shoot. Your fragrance that we've been working on for, I don't know, three years. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, I forgot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You forgot. This has been such a big dream of Kim's to have her own fragrance, and the one last thing that we have to do is shoot the fragrance campaign. It's a huge ad campaign, Kim. People are spending millions of dollars. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why can't we just postpone it? It happens. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This isn't like you. Of all the people in our entire family, you are the most business-oriented person and the hardest-working girl I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, well, I've just been, you know, taking these last few days off, trying to do nothing and just reevaluate what's important in my life, what's not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What scares me is you're putting all your happiness in your life on one person. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Santa and Reggie. &gt;&gt;: Reggie! Reggie! Reggie! &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Why don't you just move to New Orleans? &gt;&gt; KIM: In two months, I'll move here. I'll come to every single game. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay? I promise. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're just so much better than that. This isn't you. I want you to get up right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: When you've been together with someone for years, and then you take some time off, it's really hard. It's just a really tough time for me right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you don't get showered and cleaned up by the time I get back, I'm gonna be very, very disappointed, okay? So, come on, honey. Let's get it together. We've got work to do, Kim! I don't have all day to wait around till you show up to another meeting, okay? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What are we doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Charades. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: All right, guys... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No porns, Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Porn? Being around the family makes Kim really happy, so I'm having Family Game Night tonight to cheer her up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Movie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One word. <i>Scream.</i> <i>Arachnophobia.</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: Robert! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What? Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Boner. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How is that a movie? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's two words, and it's not a movie. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Isn't it one word? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. What up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are ya? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hello, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, I have some news to tell you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, my turn to do my charades. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello? We have some news. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, ready. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Classy, real classy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott and I are about to find out the sex of the baby in a few days, and Scott tries to share the news with everyone, and he is completely ignored by the entire family. &gt;&gt; KIM: Three words. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Second word. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kick. &gt;&gt; KIM: Punch. Beat. Tae Bo. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: First word. &gt;&gt; KIM: Choke. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kill. &gt;&gt; KIM: Dead. Deadbeat. Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott? Baby? &gt;&gt; KIM: Deadbeat dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Deadbeat dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're calling me a deadbeat father? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's putting in an effort, trying to be cool with everyone, and Khloe just always has to go there. And it's just not funny. We were coming here to hang out. He doesn't need to come here. This isn't his family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so leave. We're hanging out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So we <i>are</i> gonna leave. Why would he subject himself to you guys talkingabout him when this isn't even his family? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, don't leave. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, why are my gifts open? This is why I need my own house, pronto! You're stealing all my &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kim? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He doesn't need to come here. This isn't his family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so leave. We're hanging out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So we are gonna leave. Why would he subject himself to you guys talkingabout him when you're not even his family. Let's go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, it was lovely seeing you guys. I tried. I'll go be a deadbeat father elsewhere. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't leave. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're just a bunch of ass- &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See ya later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was thinking in the car, okay, "I just feel really bad that you always have to deal with my family." I feel like maybe it wouldn't be an awful idea to move to New York, you and I. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: At this time in my life, I just don't need this kind of negative energy around me, and I'm so done and over this, I'm ready to move to New York, where Scott's family is who's more than supportive of us, so happy, so nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're completely not thinking straight, and there's no way you can just move to New York and not be around your family all day every day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm saying we could have our own family there. Like, I don't need all of them to be... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know. Trust me, I would love us to have our family there, but I think you're overreacting, and I appreciate you being upset for me, but just because they disapprove of me can't mean you're gonna get up and move across the country. You've got a lot going on here and a lot going on with your family. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I went off to college. I lived away from my family then. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, but getting up and moving your life <i>now</i> is a big difference. You're not in college anymore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, we'll figure it out. I just feel like it wouldn't be a bad idea. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got to remember, I've also been dealing with this for years. And I do it for you, and I'll keep doing it for you if it makes you happy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Well, you order Chinese, and I'm gonna go shower. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom. Wait. Why are these open? So I come to my mom's house, and I realize that some of my wedding gifts have been tampered with. Mom! Mom! Why are my gifts open?! &gt;&gt; ROB: What?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are my gifts open? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Those gifts have been sitting there, Khloe, and nobody's paying it any attention. And we have to start... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, whose are these? I ordered these. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have the same glasses, and I was just gonna... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I just saw the Williams-Sonoma box out there. Why are these opened? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause I opened them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why did you open them? This is my wedding present. Why did-- what the? You guys are taking all my This isn't fair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Doesn't it smell good? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, give me back my waffle maker! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I told you so, I told you so. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is why I need my own house, pronto! You're stealing all my! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who else wants a waffle? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's get going. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...you're gonna have to buy, let's do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm bringing my Flip camera to go house hunting today. Since Lamar has practice, he can barely come with me to look at all these homes. So I'm gonna show him a private showing when I get back to the hotel. Double staircase. I like the high ceilings. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love this place. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you haven't even seen it yet. This is pretty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But that goes right outside. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that's so cute! That would be fun for naked nights. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Aw! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love the backyard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The kitchen is, like, a little old to me for such a new house, don't you think? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just have to imagine everything with nothing in it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, but there's already so much work I would have to do. Next house. Moving on to the next house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's see what happens here. So I like it already. Gated, on the corner. Kind of cute. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, my God, Khloe, this house is amazing. This kitchen-- are-are we gonna talk about this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I-- This kitchen is better than my kitchen, and now I'm pissed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, I think this is the house. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: The view. &gt;&gt; KRIS: From the bathroom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Baby, look at my closet, for me! This house is perfect. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: This is it, Khloe. I am so excited. This place is amazing! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Gated, there's security, has enough bedrooms, the ceilings are high enough. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is your house. Trust me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's empt-- it's empty, it's brand-new. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, give me the phone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's to die for. Hold on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, doll, it's Kris. Here's what I think. It is S-E-X-Y. Championship style, you know what I'm saying? A basketball player needs to live in this house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This house is perfect, except it's a little out of our price range. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, it's negotiable. But it's, it's around, it's around, no, it's, uh, I-- it's around the budget. It's around five. But it's a little bit more than that, but I think it's negotiable. Oh, my God, I'm, like, lying. I think there's a basketball court out there. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have a photo shoot today. And I'm really having a hard time just dealing with what's going on in my personal life, and I'm trying not to bring that into my professional life. I just need a little bit of time to go through what I'm going through. I'm just not in the mood for this photo shoot. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Real pretty legs and-- yeah. A little warmer in the expression. Try different positions. Try crossing it over. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kim, you look gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: And watch that hand. Like, cross-- can you cross both hands like this? Beautiful. I love that. &gt;&gt; KIM: The last thing I want to do right now is go and take pictures and try and be sexy. I don't feel sexy, I don't feel cute, I don't want to be here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your world is not over, honey. There's so much-- Look at you. Look what happens when you... &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to apologize to everyone. I'm just really not feeling good today. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, we're done, guys, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can only imagine what Kim's going through. And trying to work out things with Reggie is becoming even more stressful. There's a lot of stuff going on, and Kim's feeling a little lost. This is not who you are, okay? You are a-a wonderful girl, God has given you incredible blessings, and you need to appreciate them. You can't let this ruin your spirit. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just really don't care about my career anymore. I feel like it's cost me my relationship. I don't want to do it anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Close the door before another one will open. &gt;&gt; AGENT: Five bedrooms, seven bathrooms. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, it's like we're in Spain or something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today, I'm showing Lamar my dream house. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: This is incredible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This house is perfect except for one thing. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's the price? &gt;&gt; AGENT: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice seeing you. He said, "What's the price?" and I just started laughing. &gt;&gt; AGENT: Negotiable. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Negotiable? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today, I'm showing Lamar the house I found, and I hope he loves it, too. Lamar is so busy, I just want to take this off his plate. &gt;&gt; AGENT: Five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, about 7,000 square feet. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, it's like we're in Spain or something. &gt;&gt; AGENT: Yep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, it's Italy. This is a chick magnet. Too bad you aren't single. &gt;&gt; AGENT: After the games, you jump in the tub. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's a big tub, too. Looks like the perfect size for me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This whole side could be mine. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: And this is mine? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Humor. Look at the views. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: This is, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: This is incredible. It's a good way to wake up every morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In the kitchen, here you could sit while I'm cooking you food. &gt;&gt; AGENT: All the plasmas stay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a big, nice kitchen for me to cook and clean. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's the price? &gt;&gt; AGENT: It's 5.9 million. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I could tell Lamar loves this house just as much as I do, except for the one problem. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Low five, given the recession. &gt;&gt; AGENT: This was reduced about a million dollars. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It was 4.9? &gt;&gt; AGENT: It was, it was 6.9, now it's 5.9. But now's the time to buy. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Now's the time to b-- wow. Persuasive speaking, I'm into it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, who are you texting? Or is this texting or e-mailing? I'm sorry, I don't know the lingo. Oh, I know Kim's been really upset about Reggie. And, you know, sometimes it's good if you just get away with your daughter, just the two of us, and do a little talking. You want a doughnut? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No? I'd buy you a doughnut. See, I don't like the ones that are sharper. I still like this one right here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie likes these ones. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That was pretty good. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we walk into the Adidas store, and what do I see? A huge blown-up picture of Reggie. It's like, even when I'm trying to forget about him, he's everywhere. It's like, oh, is that a sign? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a sign. Everything's a sign. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really have a lot of respect for Bruce. He's an athlete, you know? He's had to be in relationships, traveling the world, not having time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let me give you a perspective from where he is, 24 years old. When I was 24 years old, I lived and breathed sports. It's all I did. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What he's doing right now, he has to be-- and like I had to be-- extremely selfish. If you want to get to where you want to get to, you have to be selfish. You have to be selfish with your time, you got to be selfish with your emotions. And the relationship part, God, obviously I've ended up in divorce, so obviously it wasn't too good. &gt;&gt; KIM: What Bruce said to me really, it has hit me hard. Maybe he's right. Maybe I need to just step back and let Reggie be selfish and focus on his career. And I need to really do the same for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's going on? What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're just talking about Kim and Reg. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What about you and Reg? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just finally, today... It, like, it all clicked for me, and I'm like, "It's over. Like, it's done. "I have to move on. I have to accept it. "I have to take down all the pictures in my house. I have to move on." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, you need to go through the process. Everyone needs to go through, like, the grieving, sad whatever. I think that Kim always was the one who wanted to get married first and have kids and obviously, you know, you can't plan your life out, and I think Kim needs to embrace that this is where her life is right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I was a little bit in denial. I need to take down all the pictures in my house. I feel like I've had them up for a long time. And just let go. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mama. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm getting my hair done. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's nice. Khloe, did you tell Lamar about the house? What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I showed it to him, and he loved it. Like, he thought it was to die for, but then, as soon as I told him the price, and it was almost $2 million over the budget, he gave me, he wasn't too thrilled about that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, I think that-- honestly, Khloe, you need to light some candles, honey. You need to put some rose petals in the bathtub. Sex him up a little bit and he will be happy to buy you that house at the end of the day. You guys are going to be really happy there. He just doesn't know it yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want the new and improved Heidi Fleiss? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You'll get that house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think you've definitely lost your mind. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I haven't lo-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I will trust you, and I will try it your way for one day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what to do. Turn it on, honey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My problem with Scott is, he is a con artist, and someone needs to beat the out of him. Don't touch her! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you kidding me, Khloe? Get away from us! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yo. Perfect timing. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He likes these. I really hope Kris's plan works because I just see us living in this home. So, like, my whole ass sticks out, which is really kind of cute. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He likes playing this game. We've already played it. Hide-and-go-seek. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah, so handcuffs, black... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Black, I agree. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You're good to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna change. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Okay, I'm lighting, and I'm leaving. Good luck, champ. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Peace. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How is the house hunting going? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, like, seriously? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your first house you're house hunting for. I love this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a nightmare. House hunting is not the most fun... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We found one that I really liked, but it was totally out of our price range like, beyond. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But he said he was going to think about it. From all the houses I've seen so far, I just see us living in this home. I have never felt that way so far. I hope he feels the same way and we can put a bid on the house. I should call and see if he's thought about it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is so exciting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, baby. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, have you thought about the house in Bel Air? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: $4.9 million is a lot of money for a house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Okay. At first, I'm a little disappointed, but then he talks to me, and he lets me know that the point is for us to build memories and have a family together, him and I, and I completely agree with him. That is way too much house for us. I love you, too. Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What did he say? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He made valid points. He just says this house, is like, 9,500 square feet. It's huge. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's like, "I mean, we're by ourselves." And when he's on road trips, he doesn't want to leave me there alone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm getting to like this guy more and more all the time. He actually is practical. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sometimes I let Kris, like, screw with my mind and let me think I need, like, some mansion. I think I just let Kris Jenner bite her teeth into me and I got poisoned with her money-spending-ness. I love Lamar because he brings me back to reality. Because my family definitely has no sense of reality. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't be into the overkill that Mom's into. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what Lamar said. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See that? We think the same. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. There's a difference. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We think the same. Lamar is... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You might think the same, but he actually acts... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Lamar is kind of a younger version of me, isn't he? That's why you like him. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, I found ten. So, this one... Look at the fountains in the pool here. And look at the pictures of this house, like, the foyer. There's a putting green. This has got 11 bedrooms and 15 bathrooms. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: But look at the pool. This is an Olympic-sized swimming pool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, honestly, you're going nuts. You are going nuts, okay? Seriously... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going nuts? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am trying to find you guys the best house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! Stop! Okay? Listen, Lamar and I, we don't need your help. Lamar and I are doing this on our own. We're done with you helping. Lamar and I are doing this without Kris. I cannot let her poison my mind any longer. We really want to stay on budget. We want to find a house that's us. It's our love that makes the house, not the house that makes the love. Aw. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For God's sake, I'm just trying to help! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can hear you all the way down the hall. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How do you feel about a house in Bel Air? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not good. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You excited for tomorrow, about the old baby visit, to finally find out if it's a boy or a girl? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but I hope they can tell. Sometimes, like, the baby crosses its legs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, the doctor said the next time, they would figure it out. Your parents will come, you think? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. We didn't even tell them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know, but... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And they wouldn't even listen when you were trying to, so why... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right, but I don't care. I feel like I'd give it a second chance and hope for the best. I'm going to try to do everything I can to bring this family back together and I think inviting them to find out the baby's sex with us is going to make things a lot better. You care if I call her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Do you want to use my phone? I am just over their lack of support. Scott is the father and they need to accept it or I want nothing to do with them. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Now, are we going to want to see--want to see the baby today? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am obviously upset that my family isn't here to find out the sex of the baby. It's just stupid. Like, this is a bigger thing that's going on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, it's Kris. Leave your name and number, and I'll call you back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Kris, it's Scott. I didn't want you to not be involved in tomorrow's doctor's visit. We're going to find out the baby's sex, so we really, really, really wanted you to be there. It's at 4:30 tomorrow. Take Bruce, take the little girls, whoever. Everybody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that Scott really wants to be accepted by my family. He genuinely loves them and knows how important my relationship with my family is. So it's important to him because of how important it is to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just hope everybody comes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We'll see. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why are you going to be so negative? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: One step at a time. ♫ ♫ Let's hope. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. You look like an old Hollywood movie star. That's exactly... &gt;&gt; KIM: I am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look like... &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom and I have dreamed of having my own fragrance for years now and it's here and I have to live in the moment and I have to soak it all in. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stunning, Kim. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Sure. I don't need a relationship to define who I am. I know no matter what, I'll be okay. I'm a <i>strong</i> woman. Mom, look! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that is incredible. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's all happening. All right, I'm back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Done. Love you. It's so pretty. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; Scott and Kourtney, how are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. How you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; Good to see you, too. So, actually, Dr. Crane's ready to see you, so you can both come on in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Oh, perfect. &gt;&gt; I'll get you into the room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am obviously upset that my family isn't here to find out the sex of the baby. It's just stupid. Like, this is a bigger thing that's going on. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Now, want to see the baby today? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The sex? &gt;&gt; CRANE: Yeah. The sex. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's just find out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Oh, wait, is that them? &gt;&gt; CRANE: Huh? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come in. &gt;&gt; Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes? &gt;&gt; Honey, your family's here. Can I bring them in? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, please. Hi. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is Kendal. &gt;&gt; CRANE: These guys look like twins, don't they? Hey, Kris, how are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I've been laying just right where you're laying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And this is Robert. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's all right, he delivered them-- he knows. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm very happy that the family is here to support me and find out the sex of the baby with me. I mean, this is all we've been thinking about. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Listen, we're about ready to tell you guys the sex. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ooh. Let's do it. We got a lot of bets going. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I bet it's a girl. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: We bet it's a boy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I bet it's a boy. &gt;&gt; CRANE: So, look it, here's the baby's face-- you see this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Aw... &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Wait, is that the heartbeat? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Its heart. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was so unexpected and really sweet that Scott invited us to come see the baby. I think that there's a side of Scott that maybe I've overlooked a little bit, and I'm beginning to really feel like Scott just wants to be about family now. He's gonna be a new dad, and he wants us to be involved. And that's making me really, really happy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See? I think... That's what I'm saying. Boy, Scott, you know, he's really trying, and that's important to me. He seems to be making a real effort-- bringing everybody to find the sex of the baby, doing things like that-- just trying to get involved with the family, and hey, that's a good thing. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Is that the uterus? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's the placenta, Rob. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a boy. It's a boy. &gt;&gt; CRANE: That's definitely... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wish Khloe was here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. Where is Khloe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think Khloe probably didn't show up today because she's still having a hard time with the whole Scott thing. It's actually really sad to me that she's missing out on such an amazing family moment. Hey, I want to apologize for Khloe, on behalf of Khloe, that she couldn't be here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, you can't apologize on someone else's behalf. Will you throw that away? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you all for coming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She really wanted to be here, Kourtney, I promise. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: "Odom" rhymes with "scrotum." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, that's great. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is Scrotum. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I-I've heard of him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I wouldn't talk, <i>Bush.</i> &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is this conversation? Bush and scrotum? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How cool was it yesterday when we got to see the baby? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney has a huge penis inside of her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you seen the penis? &gt;&gt; KIM: We did see the penis. It's, like, how weird is it to know that there's a penis inside of you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why didn't you go, Khloe? Why weren't you there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I don't support anything Scott does. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it's about your sister, not Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But it's Kourtney-- you can't not show up for her doctor's appointment because you're mad at Scott, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not that I'm not showing up-- I was busy, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you have to try a little bit harder... and get on the bandwagon, because he's, like, not all that bad. He's trying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott is not trying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's trying. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, he is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you guys serious? This is what he always does. I used to care a lot about Scott's feelings. Scott has screwed up too many times for me to care anymore. If Scott doesn't care, I don't care. Scott alwaysup, and he's good for a couple months after, then heup again. Do you guys, like, just forget about the cycle beforehand? Anyone? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we're trying to have a really... we're trying to look at the glass half full and not half-empty. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott is gonna be in our lives forever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, he's not. &gt;&gt; KIM: You'd think that after her getting married and understanding a little bit more, Khloe'd be nicer, but I think that she just has this, like, built-up anger against Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Listen, this is how I feel-- there's a lot of people in this family... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got to go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and we all have to get along, you know? We're all together all the time. And you're walking away. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think Khloe pretty much went through the breakup as much as you did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My problem with Scott is, he is a con artist, he's annoying and, I mean, honestly, someone needs to beat the ... out of him. Don't touch her! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: The whole family decides to have a little family dinner. We go to STK, and I'm really excited that Khloe's here. Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, doll. Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: The whole family's really gonna look snazzy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: I like that dress on you, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like my family's being so hypocritical right now. Just because Scott calls us <i>one</i> time to go to a doctor's appointment, everyone's supposed to jump and be, like, "Oh, Scott's so sweet-- he invited us." Scott is still a douche. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This shrimp, is that with the little skewer in the middle? What is the shrimp with the skewer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why do you have to do that whenever you say "skewer"? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got to get involved. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: After screwing up my sister's life, I'm allowed to despise him. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I would love you to be a part of my family, Scott. I think I'm the only one that really does like you, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's not true. I think Kourtney <i>kind of</i> likes me. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I think Kourtney kind of likes you. Bruce, I feel, is growing. Khloe hates you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe and I got along better when we went together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you think <i>I</i> feel for Scott? &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like you, you feel like Scott's a malice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. True. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then you got so... emotionally... into our situation that we had... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think Khloe pretty much went through the breakup as much as you did. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. No, I do. Like, Khloe starts getting a few drinks in her, and I could already feel the tension coming with Khloe and Scott, and it's just making me lose my appetite. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And the thing is, when Khloe and I make up, there's a big difference, because there's no make-up sex. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's hope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not at all. My problem with Scott is, he is a con artist, he's annoying, and, I mean, honestly, someone needs to beat theout of him. Well, this is a fun dinner. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Dinner wasn't... It was bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dinner was a real... You know what? You and I reminiscing on old times. Just, you know, admit it, you were a little slow at the party! You thought she was gonna slip away from you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course I did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's why you knocked her up with the old sausage. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I had to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You sperminated that woman! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I'm tired. I'm not in the mood to deal... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, come on, honestly, no, sit down... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm tired. Stop. I'm tired! I'm tired. I want to go. Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tell her to sit down. It was just a joke. Scott just used... He didn't want to use a condom one day; he just wanted to have a baby with you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're right, I did want to have a baby with her, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He wanted to keep her for 18 years and not let anybody else have her... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 18 years? Try for eternity. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, wait, I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm tired. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, we're just playing. Just sit. We're just playing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe, stop. Khloe, she's pregnant.
