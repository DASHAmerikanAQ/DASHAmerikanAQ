- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you know Kylie's having an eighteenth birthday party in two weeks with, like, 300 people or something? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't been invited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me, neither. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What a little Kylie is. I'm calling her now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. So I just heard you're throwing a huge birthday bash? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I am. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And Kourtney and I have not been invited yet. Is there a reason why? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. I haven't told anybody. I'm not gonna tell anybody until I for sure know where I want it and everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, don't you want us to hold the date? What if we're busy? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're never gonna be busy on my birthday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. August 10? I'm already busy that day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have an event on August 10. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Where? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: San Francisco. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can you fly back from San Francisco or something? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you beg me hard enough. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who would you want to come the most out of all your sisters? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Probably Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! Okay, I'll cancel my San Francisco appearance. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you really have one? Wait. Should I cancel my London, um, my London appearance? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You don't have a London appearance. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: So this is it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, they've really demolished. Holy &gt;&gt; KIM: And then we built that thing at the end to put art. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, I can't believe you guys moved fully in, and now this is happening. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's pretty crazy. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: When are you supposed to move in? &gt;&gt; KIM: December. We're remodeling our house. There's still so much that we'd want to do to it to make it perfect. This is what the kitchen will kind of look like. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is sick. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're hoping that it would be ready before the baby's born, so I hope that everything sticks according to plan. I just cannot wait to get out of my mom's. It's been great, but they are just so loud. Like, they don't even... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I know, but it's their house. It's not... You can't control it when you're used to being a certain level in your house. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love my mom, and she's so gracious to let us live there, but last time we remodeled our house, you know, we definitely had our differences. This one has a lock on it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: First, let's start out by saying this is my closet, and my drawer. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you really think that... that this is your house. &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot stay there for a long period of time, so I just hope that we can make it a really easy, pleasant experience. It's just really hard with, like, a baby, and, like, they just don't... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You know this already. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...have any consideration? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You know this. You've put yourself back into the oven. Like, it's crazy. Crazy, crazy, crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm 25 pounds up on the scale today. Aah! And I'm only halfway there. Last time, I gained 50, but I delivered six weeks early, and they say you gain the most at the end. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you do. If you were full term... &gt;&gt; KIM: I probably would have gained 70. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to remember that you're making another human being, and that you... you-you were able to really get in the best shape of your life after your baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. No, I know. I'm not worried. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And you'll do it again. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not worried about after. I'm just thinking about number three. Like, if I have three... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Number three?! &gt;&gt; KIM: ...then that's where I think your body really starts to slip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa. Can we just slow down and have number two? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I heard that, uh... Caitlyn is very upset... &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...that she wasn't invited to the graduation. First of all, it was a surprise graduation for the girls, and, yes, their dad probably should have been there, when I think about it in hindsight, but it wasn't malicious, and I didn't mean to hurt anybody's feelings. &gt;&gt; KIM: Also, you guys have separate lives now, and that's okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I feel really bad that Caitlyn wasn't invited to the graduation party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's talk about the graduation. Are you inviting Caitlyn? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think I'm ready. I haven't even met her yet. To be honest, I'm scared to death. I understand why she would be upset, but on the other hand, it's such a sensitive subject, and it's something that really needs to be done in private. I mean, I'm just, like, I haven't even met her yet. I don't know if I could handle it. I need to do it on my own terms. &gt;&gt; KIM: We've felt like he's had such crazy feelings towards you in the things that he's said. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I don't know how he thinks that it's... &gt;&gt; KIM: So why would he want to come? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I kind of think sometimes, she thinks that Bruce Jenner said those things, and Vanity Fair article. Well, now that he's Caitlyn, he still has to take responsibility for what Bruce Jenner said, kind of. You know, like... like, he really hurt my feelings. Why am I supposed to be so forgiving when we haven't even discussed it since? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know? &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't have to cry now. She's not even here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, and just thinking about it breaks my heart. I know. It just scares me a little. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but it's time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, but it does. It's like I just... I... I don't know. It's hard. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Did you see my Guinness Book of World Records? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: That's The Guinness Book of World Records official... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wow. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: ...officially sent me "The Fastest Ever" to a million followers on Twitter. And I did beat out, in the Teen Choice Awards, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and everything, for Social Media Queen. I need to be on my phone. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God, you're a changed woman. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: That's true. But, for me, it's a great way to communicate a lot of the things I'm trying to do. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can I post this? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Uh, sure. Let's get to the important stuff. What about your birthday? Want to have your friends over here for a party? I mean, I can throw something here. Come on, this is a great party house. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I've been thinking about it. I was just going to do something with my friends. I just really don't want to deal with the drama. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah, but it's 18. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, but... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You got to do something. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Between you and Mom... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Me and Mom what? We're fine. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You guys haven't even met. I want both my parents at my birthday party, but I know that my mom and my dad are both struggling with their relationship, so, I just don't really want to deal with the Mom-Dad drama. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You're 18. You can make up your own decision about what you want to do. Don't have your mom talk you into something. Okay? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. I'm not talking to either of you guys. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Uh, by the way, I have you a prezy. I-I only have a couple of these, and I'm gonna give one to you. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Can you handle this? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm. Stop. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: What do you think? My picture's all over 'em, and, of course, we do have the bottoms. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is way too inappropriate for me to wear. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I totally agree. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have my dad on my underwear? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Okay, well, I can give 'em to somebody else. Do you want 'em? I want them! &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, of course you want them. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Kris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Jonathan. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's up? &gt;&gt; COREY: Hey. Taking care of the women, man and the kids. That's about it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You guys look cozy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Welcome to the playhouse. &gt;&gt; COREY: Chillin'. We just... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I just got back from Italy, so I didn't get my sneakers. They're at my house waiting for me. &gt;&gt; COREY: You missing out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Jeally? Look at! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: A little bit, yeah. I'll have them tomorrow night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We got our Yeezys. We're excited. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Ooh, those are nice. Yo, what up?! &gt;&gt; COREY: How was the vacay, man? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This house is so much quieter without Kylie, though. This is weird. You don't have, like, 37 random kids running around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I just have Kim, Kanye, North, the nanny... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Right, but you know them all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...the housekeeper, the chef, the trainer. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: And with Kylie, you have 37 people you didn't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like... Dr. Zhivago? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, not this again. Dr. Zhivago? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She tricked me and took me on this trip, and she wanted to stay home and watch Dr. Zhivago. What the? That's crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop! What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Shh. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Huh? I'm telling... What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because North is taking a nap. This is nap time, prime time. Seriously, it's so rude. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're not serious? She can't hear us. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I am. She's taking a nap, and her room is right there. Yes, she can. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah, her room is... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, she wasn't upstairs? &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, you're not in the little room anymore? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, they took over three or four bedrooms this time. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh. And you're complaining? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then she yells at me in my own bathroom and tells me, like, what to do and... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You knew this was gonna happen, though. You allowed this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, but I said to her... I said, "I just..." &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She's the boss! &gt;&gt; KIM: Shh. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, sorry. Sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. We can't even, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. Have some respect. I'll literally kick you out of here. I love Jonathan. I love that he's, like, hanging out with my mom, but I have a baby in this house. I need no one to wake her, and they have got to shut up. Seriously, keep it down. &gt;&gt; COREY: What theis wrong with her? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Bend your knees, sink that seat down towards knee level. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. Hi, Heather. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh... &gt;&gt; HEATHER: Are you doing pregnant ballet? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're doing Pure Barre. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Pure Barre? I think it's great that Kim's working out, but I think it would be nice if she gave me a little heads up. What are you gonna do on your birthday? Why are you so funky? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, between you and Caitlyn, it's just, like, I'm not gonna not invite my dad. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; TRAINER: Before we get started, we're gonna just show you, like, some of the basic moves that you'll be doing throughout the whole class, so, if you're at the bar, or if you're seated, something we talk about a lot in Pure Barre is a tuck. It's basically tightening the base of your seat and your low abs, but you never want to arch your back. It's gonna be hard, but it's take it at your own pace. Bend you knees, sink that seat down towards knee level. Keep that tailbone nice and heavy. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I need a glass of wine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. Hi, Heather. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: Are you doing pregnant ballet? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, we're doing Pure Barre, a good workout. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Pure Barre? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think I want anyone to see me going into, like, classes looking like a huge cow? &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: I want to see you lift your leg. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, okay, well, I'm having some people over for dinner in, like, an hour. Are you gonna be wrapped up by then, or...? &gt;&gt; KIM: If I can get through it all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I think it's great that Kim's working out and staying healthy, but I think it would be nice if she gave me a little heads up, considering it's my house. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, yummy. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: So, they all moved back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All of 'em. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: But why couldn't they just go to another house? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Why would you? Look around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She has a house. She has her house in Bel Air. And then she bought this house and redid it, and then, she redid it again. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Mm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And so... &gt;&gt; HEATHER: And Kanye just, like, loves being here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. They both do. They're never gonna leave. I get yelled at in my own house. "Mom, you're making too much noise." "Mom, you're too busy." &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like to do things my way, so I like to set my music and have my candles and lay out my stuff and I don't want to have ballet class in the middle of it. I mean, is that wrong? I love my kids and I think it's really nice that they still want to come and even live with me, but sometimes Kim, I think, just takes it for granted. She needs to remember that I live here, too. Sooner or later we're gonna have to establish some boundaries. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: Khloe just bought the house in Tarzana, and you said... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; HEATHER: ..."I'm glad she bought the house in Tarzana, but I think she's gonna regret not buying in Hidden Hills." And Kim goes, "Oh, my God, Mom, enough with the Hidden Hills! Not everybody on Earth wants to live in the Hidden Hills. She doesn't want to live in Hidden Hills, that's why I lived in Beverly Hills, 'cause I don't want to live in Hidden Hills." And then she goes and buys a Hidden Hills house and then moves in with you, to Hidden Hills. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, she isn't going anywhere, honey. She'll be building on that piece of property, but she'll go, "Oh, I think I'll change the toilet "paper holder-- can I move back in with you?" I mean, that's how I feel that's going on over there. This is supposed to be a really bad rainy season. Like, crazy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm excited. Are you excited? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: For the winter, and winter clothes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. And fireplaces and hot chocolate. What do you want to do for your birthday-- you want to celebrate and do a party? It's a big birthday. We could do a family dinner if you want. Why are you so funky? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, between you and Caitlyn it's just like, I don't know, you guys are weird. And then I'm not gonna not invite my dad and invite my mom. Or vice versa. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think you have to worry about that. I think you have to let adults go through their thing and we'll figure it out. To hear that Kylie has anxiety over her dad and I-- it breaks my heart. Especially at her birthday. So I think I have to be strong enough to create a great relationship with Caitlyn, because my kids' feelings are more important than my own right now. Nothing will take the shine away from you at your birthday. We're not that selfish. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I still very much love Lamar, but I need to move forward. I don't think you really ever have peace from walking away from any situation that you wish, you know, ended up different. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce was always on time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who is an hour late? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, this is rude. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm starting to get nervous if she'll even show up. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I just realized I still have your name as, um, "Bruce" in my phone. It's Cait. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: How are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm okay. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: When are we gonna get together? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you have to come over for a glass of wine one evening. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I could come over there or you could come over here, I've got your wine here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now that I know how Kylie really feels, I think the most important thing that we can do right now is make sure that her dad and I get along so that the kids-- especially Kylie-- never has to worry about something like this again. Do you-do you want to join us? We're gonna have a little dinner at Nobu to kind of kick off Kylie's birthday. She just wants to have a little family dinner, just her siblings and me and then you and, um, that's it. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This definitely makes me nervous, but sooner or later I'm gonna have to meet Caitlyn and right now I think the time needs to be sooner. I just think that we have to find a way to just be together as a family when we have special occasions, and I think that Kylie's birthday would be a really good place to start. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah, I agree. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, um... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: We agree on something! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, sweetie. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How long have you had these allergies? &gt;&gt; KIM: This morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like you didn't have 'em, though, when we were doing Glam. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I did. &gt;&gt; COREY: Oh, she can't take none of that stuff. 'Cause of the baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but it's so annoying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, so I forgot to tell you, I'm having Faye's wedding at... in my back yard. I'm sorry. You were the one who wanted to move in. You can just go to Kourtney's house... &gt;&gt; KIM: How torturous. With your driveway like that? How can you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It'll be done. So we have to live together for quite a few more months. And we have to make it work cohesively, do you know what that means? With happiness... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not an idiot, Yeah, I do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to minimize the amount of human beings in my bathroom every morning. I think it's time to just maybe review some of the ground rules. Kim, but... there are definitely some boundaries. So what else do you think would help? I got to figure out where the nursery will be, 'cause I'll definitely have the baby at your house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What, you need another room? &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can't the baby sleep in your room? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I mean... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you asking me? &gt;&gt; COREY: The red room should be the nursery. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Clean that closet out... &gt;&gt; KRIS: How come everyone else dictates what I do with my closets? Do you know I haven't had my closets to myself in, like, three years? You guys know that, right? Like, I don't even know where my stuff is. If you gave me a million dollars to find something, I probably couldn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think you just got to get rid of some &gt;&gt; KRIS: This lunch was supposed to be about establishing boundaries, and every time I... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just a boundary. I'll take the small room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why do I have boundaries? It's my house. We have to work together. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not taking Kendall's room, 'cause that's your closet room. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Kourtney, hey, Kourtney, over here. Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, they have watermelon lemonade. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The pasta mama is really good, but I don't want to entice you to get a pasta. &gt;&gt; KIM: That sounds amazing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is so good. So, um, how is everything? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, with Lamar? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, I still very much love Lamar, but I need to move forward. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like that's a big step, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think you really ever have peace from walking away from any situation that you wish, you know, ended up differently. Do I know for a fact that I've done every single thing that I could to try to save that marriage, 100%? &gt;&gt; KIM: You've told him, like, "Come fix this marriage." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I don't think he understands, and that's what's so hard. Then I wonder, like, so what have I been fighting for? I think filing for the divorce is the worst thing in the world. It's the worst feeling. You feel like you're hurting everybody. But I need to live my life the best that I know how and do what I feel is best. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Tyga and I are together. I guess we'll just see where it goes. Mom invited Caitlyn to the dinner. I just hope that we can make it through the night without any family drama. &gt;&gt; KIM: Excited, nervous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A little bit nervous, but I feel like at the end of it I'll be really glad that I finally met Caitlyn. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, we are here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How did you injure yourself-- by working out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, it's really hard to get in shape. Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're like... I can hear your bones, like, creaking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And popping. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I have to cancel my workouts all this week 'cause of scheduling. Khloe no likey that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What happened with these divorce papers on Friday? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It takes a long time for things to go through the system and to get in the judge's hands. I told Laura, "Let's, like, tell the judge we need to speed this "along, I'm not gonna do this forever." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think of all the relationships that I've had the privilege of being around, the one that I thought would be forever tried and true was Khloe and Lamar. And it breaks my heart to see all of this go on. Khloe, I love you. I just want you to be okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How the hell do you wear these? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So why would you buy them? This is so pointless if you don't know how you're gonna wear it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. So... Mom invited Caitlyn to the dinner. They're both gonna be there and I'm... interested. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've never seen them interact together. It's gonna be weird. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. I want both my parents at my birthday dinner, but I'm also a little nervous because this is the first time I'm gonna see my mom and my dad together. I just hope that we can make it through the night without any family drama. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think it's our job to not make it awkward. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, duh. I need to find an outfit for Bootsy Bellows and Nobu. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bootsy, I picked out my outfit. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I didn't tell Dad about Bootsy Bellows, though. I don't think I'm gonna invite Mom or Dad because, I don't know, it's just stressing me out. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You should. It's just nice to know, like... I'd want that peace of mind, like, "Oh, I was invited." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know, it's just stressing me out. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do you have to take a? You're making a face like you have to take a No. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're so mean. Do you remember when we were younger, growing up, we both knew when each other, like, had to? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's why I know you have to take aright now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't, I swear to God. If I had to, I'm not... I'm not five again-- like, I would handle my business. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is it sunny in here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm just too... lazy to take my sunglasses off. &gt;&gt; KIM: Would you like me to take them off for you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You didn't hear back from Scott, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He said he was gonna come over last night, but then he didn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think you'll ever get back with Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I don't think so. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you miss him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, yeah, it's hard to, like, I don't know, just... especially, I feel, like, on the weekend, just to, like, do stuff as a family, but I think that his life, I just, far that he would have to go and, like, so much work to do and... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Can I tell you what happened to me yesterday? &gt;&gt; KIM/KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I looked down at my phone and it was ringing and it said: FaceTime Audio. It was Lamar, and he must have butt-dialed me and it went on FaceTime Audio. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, what was he saying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He was just telling somebody what to pack or put in his bag, and he was preparing a little mini wardrobe together. He's texted me a few times recently. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is he texting you about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, he talks about realizing past mistakes and wanting a fresh start. after the fact that Khloe filed for the fact that she's moved on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's so focused on moving forward and leaving the past behind, and then when I tell her that he's trying to reach out-- she waited for two years for him to reach out, and he's reaching out? &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't that always how life happens? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. It's so sad for me. It's almost like it pains me to tell her that he texts me. Because it breaks my heart. It's, like, she was in so much pain for so long and would have given anything for that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: You're wearing your ring? So lame. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was my 20-year anniversary present. &gt;&gt; KIM: Excited? Nervous? What's your vibe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A little bit nervous, but I feel like at the end of it I'll be really glad that I finally... met Caitlyn. ♫ ♫ Now that Caitlyn is coming to the birthday dinner, I really feel like I should go over and meet her, privately, in person, before I have to do that in front of the kids-- because that would be really awkward. I'm really grateful for Kim being here, because it prevents me from turning around... or not going up to the front door. I just need some closure on a couple things, especially the article. I want to get to a place where it just doesn't bother me and there's not this tension and it's, like, their side against us. I want... her to know that... she's... you know, been very hurtful. In order for us to move on, if she wants to be invited to stuff... just be a decent human being, you know? Just... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...be a nice person. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is closure for you. I think it's, like, a lot of things, what you need to do today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I can't lie-- I'm a little bit nervous. Bruce was super stubborn. But who knows, maybe Caitlyn's gonna be a little different. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, we are here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's the big night! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I love you, bitch! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm 18. I am so excited. &gt;&gt; DEEJAY: And we gonna go check out some more birthday gifts for King Kylie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just that first look at Caitlyn is so surreal. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Look who's here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello! Oh, my goodness. Look at you! Nice shoes! &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Do you like those? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. How are you? Oh... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, I'm fine. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm good. I brought you some cookies. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where do you want to go? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Sit down here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just that first... surreal, and I feel like it'll take me a second to get my bearings, but I've got to hand it to her-- she looks great. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: So... enough of the small talk. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm good. I'm really good. Just working. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, I haven't heard from you in forever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just felt thrown under the bridge. I felt like you were so excited to be going through this exciting time in your life, but I feel like... I didn't want to communicate with you and be angry and be... and be... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: What would you be angry for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm, it doesn't even think. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: 'Cause it affects the kids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One of the reasons I wanted to talk to you was because I don't want your feelings to be hurt, like when I heard that you weren't happy about not being included in Kylie's graduation. making making that decision. I was so disappointed in everybody. For 15 years of my life I carpooled kids every day. Some days I would spend three or four hours a day in the car. A slap in the face... when you don't even get invited to their graduation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's exactly how I Vanity Fair article, 'cause I... spent 25 years of my life and 18 hours a day and blah, blah, blah. was months ago. We're talking about what happened just a few days ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Listen, usually people that get a divorce don't do everything together. It wasn't malicious. It didn't intend to hurt anybody's feelings. feelings still weren't healed, and I thought, wow, this is the guy that... when I, you know... I-I-I told myself I don't even want to cry. But it just hurt my feelings. What did you say? I... I "mistreated" you. It was, like, mistreated you? Yeah, we fought like cats and dogs for the last couple of years-- but that's not what you article. : And it just killed me. Because it wasn't true. And that-that's just... you know, it was, like, what happened to... just the life we had together? It's like you don't... you just threw that away. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I don't want anybody to feel bad. I thought I was very kind and nice to you. I didn't say anything that was bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Never texted me, never said anything, never called. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I almost did, and then article, like, literally killed me. You're sensitive and amazing to all these new people in your life. You're just not so sensitive and amazing to... this side of the family that you left behind. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh... A phone call would have been great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was hoping for the best, but nothing really has changed. I don't think I've ever met as stubborn as Bruce Jenner... until I met Caitlyn. &gt;&gt; KRIS: These are, like, the last few things he sent. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ma, honestly, "This dude James, is that Khloe's boyfriend?" Mom, that'sup of you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're sensitive and amazing to all these new people in your life. You're just not so sensitive and amazing to... this side of the family that you left behind. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh... A phone call would have been great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My feelings don't matter anymore. It's not... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, don't play the martyr. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not. I just don't. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Don't play the martyr-- you don't feel "oh, poor Kris, my feelings don't matter anymore." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not "oh, poor Kris." &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: That's BS. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, I'm trying to be understanding of the way that you feel and the way that you've made this huge change in your life, and I try to understand you and be accepting. But you just... are more my point of view in that, you know, why that was hurtful. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I totally disagree with that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Some days are just... hard. And I know you say you haven't gone anywhere and you're still the same person, but sometimes they just miss having... Bruce around. We all do. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: How do we move forward from this point? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, obviously, it's really important for the kids to have you as a big part of their life. We just have to get used to our new normal. I just want to get to a place where it's comfortable for us to-to share celebrations together. I think that it might take some time for Caitlyn and I to see eye to eye and understand each other's feelings, but I think that this is a really good first step in the right direction just to a better relationship for the sake of the kids. Oh, my God, you want to take a selfie? Come on. Where's the best light? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Right here. Hey, there we go. Now, what are you gonna do with this selfie? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You got lipstick all over your cheek. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's all right. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, P! No naps today, guys? No naps today? I'm gonna go in the kitchen. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Penelope. &gt;&gt; KIM: You want some granola? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want some string cheese? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: You want to go with P and get a snacky? Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, you never told me about mom meeting Caitlyn for the first time. &gt;&gt; KIM: I had to leave before. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, why? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just 'cause I had to work. So I was like, "I'll drive you there." She was so nervous. We should call her. I'm really anxious to see how everything went and, you know, how my mom felt about, you know, seeing Caitlyn face-to-face for the first time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: What happened with, uh, your talk with Caitlyn? Like, how did it go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Well, she did not have one ounce of empathy for my feelings. Listen, I know you're very excited and happy about your transition, and we're happy for you. But you just have to give it a minute and not take it so personally. &gt;&gt; KIM: From my mom's tone, it doesn't really sound like they found the common ground that they were really looking for. I mean, I just hope that with Kylie's birthday coming up that they're gonna be cordial with each other, 'cause, you know, it's about Kylie, not them, and I hope they can just put their differences aside. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I'm trying to move on. I want her to be happy. And she seems really happy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Guess what. It's not your problem anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but when you really spend that much time and energy on someone for your whole life, you know... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, now you can get taken care of and you don't have to deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. So anyway, now you're downloaded. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was riveting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, guys, I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, if it isn't the birthday girl! &gt;&gt; KIM: Happy birthday. I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: I love it. Like, it's so cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want... Where do you want to put Kourtney and Khloe? I'll sit over here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Should we have Caitlyn and Kris next to each other? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's see. Kourtney. I'll sit here. Yeah. Caitlyn should sit over there. I'll sit here. And then Kourtney and Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, hold on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Happy almost birthday, my little munchy mix. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, Bruce was always on time, and Caitlyn is late. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's probably working on her hair and her look. Can I get one more of these? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I cannot believe my mom is acting like this. This is exactly what I wanted to avoid with inviting both of my parents. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What time is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce was always on time, and Caitlyn is late. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I ask you guys a question? Who is an hour late? Kim, this is not even fashionably late anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's arrived. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There you are! &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I'm back! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why were you so late? That is not like you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I know. I am so sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce was never late. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I know. Sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is Caitlyn more late? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yes, exactly right. That's it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You look so nice. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, thank you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You do look really, really nice. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Thank you. Well, I got to look good for my girl. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want a selfie with... the both of you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Come on, yeah. Where's Kanye? &gt;&gt; KIM: He's at the studio right now. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh. Working away? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Ooh, does that look good. Where did you get those earrings? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mine? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim got 'em for me when she... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: That was a million years ago? I didn't know if they were new or not. They look great. Kris, Chuck Burtzloff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is he out there? What'd he say? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Obviously, he hasn't met Caitlyn. He comes out of the bathroom, and there I am standing there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What bathroom do you use? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, what bathroom do you use? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, I ain't going in the guys' room. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I never thought about that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So do you go in the chicks' bathroom? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course. He's... She's wearing a Tom Ford dress. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to open a birthday present? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, let's start. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ooh. So cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't copy every pose I'm doing. Stick with the one pose I gave you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ow! &gt;&gt; KIM: Here, Mom, come here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, that's so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hold on. I want to get Mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so good. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: One happy family! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: What should I say with the two parents? "The parent trap"? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I like that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, it's funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So cute. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I would like to just have a toast to my little daughter. You're number ten. Kind of sad to see my last one become an adult, but I've been very proud of you and I love you and happy birthday. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; ALL: Happy birthday. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Happy birthday, baby. Yay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Make your wish! Yes, Kylie, yes. Slay, Mother, slay. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: It's Kylie's birthday. Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good job, everybody. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, do you know what you want your grandkids to call you? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I think the less fuss you make of it... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Only person that's gonna know anything is Mason, but I don't know if he's gonna go, "Wait, that's Grandpa." &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I think you just start off with Caitlyn, yeah. It's Caitlyn. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love the fact that Caitlyn is here at Kylie's birthday. Bruce has been in my life since I've been four, so I have a very strong relationship with him. And Caitlyn is still our father figure. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: How's Lamar doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He sounds good sometimes. I don't know. If he's not making any actual progress, then I have to move on. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I totally agree. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, it took a lot for me to, like, file for divorce, but I had to. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Sorry to hear it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but it's okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: These are, like, the last few things Lamar sent. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, why are you texting him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "This dude James, is that Khloe's boyfriend?" Then she said, "I don't think so. Don't believe... I don't know him, but don't believe all the you read." Mom, that'sup of you. Why would you say that about James? Are you okay? Seriously? You're like a psychopath. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Ooh... Things haven't changed. Well, it's so good to see everybody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so we need to know... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, no. Okay. What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why were you late? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Why was I late? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. A really good excuse. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Because it's a woman's prerogative to be a little late. How's that? Was that good? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo, do you want to go? 'Cause I have to go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I have to go, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna go to the bathroom. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, it's down to the two of us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How did we get to this point? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Our last one is 18, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yep. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Thank God. Well... Come on, we can shake up the paparazzis if we leave together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah. Should we hold hands? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe. Uh, Jenner, hold on to me. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: What's up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't walk. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Everyone got along at dinner. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Give me a hug. Love you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What better way to ring in my birthday than with my mom and my dad? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: See you guys later. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; DEEJAY: King Kylie, happy birthday. Everybody make some noise for King Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's the big night. I'm 18. I am so excited. ♫ ♫ Tyga and I have always been friends.

I literally had no idea. Tyga is just the most selfless, generous, nicest person, and I am so happy. For sure, one of the best nights of my life. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ah! Kendall! &gt;&gt; KIM: On the next episode... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Toast to adventures in Mexico. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know you get excited about doing some of these appearances, and I worry a little bit. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm about to do my first club appearance, and my mom just won't stop checking up on me about it. But I'm grown now. Oh, my God. There are so many people here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Sister, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you, Kenny. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe agrees to go in the cage.
