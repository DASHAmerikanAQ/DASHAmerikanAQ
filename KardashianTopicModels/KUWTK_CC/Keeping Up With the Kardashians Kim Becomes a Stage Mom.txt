- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; DIANE: Hi, Khloe. I'm Diane Paxton. Welcome. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is my sister Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. I'm Kim. &gt;&gt; DIANE: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm the wing woman. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so stressed out. I have to take care of my family, and I have so many things on my plate. Kimberly randomly suggests acupuncture. I mean, why not? I feel like I've been trying everything else. What does acupuncture hurt? Oh,my ass. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoa. Khloe, does that hurt? That looks like it hurts so bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, shut up. &gt;&gt; DIANE: This one is like a little Valium in your ear. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ♫ Ah... ♫ &gt;&gt; DIANE: Done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; DIANE: Try not to move around. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; DIANE: And I'll be back. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you feel relaxed? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not in the slightest. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? What? What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, Bible. I just moved my head, and the entire thing, like, was paralyzed. Do not make me move. Bible. Do not make me move. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't move. Don't move. Ow!! Ow! I just put it in me so hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, God punishes in many ways. 27 00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:10,103 &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; NICK: You're on fire. Excellent, Kendall. Oh, you're killing it. This is phenomenal. That's it. I love that. Make America fall in love. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I have been modeling for almost a year and a half now. It's something that I've always liked to do. I used to always take pictures, like, with my friends and stuff. &gt;&gt; NICK: Kendall, you really should consider doing runway. This stuff is just so fantastic. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Really. &gt;&gt; NICK: That's a frickin' Times Square billboard right there. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: That's for sure. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Runway modeling scares me just a little bit, because you're in front of so many people, and if you mess up, they can all see you. Yeah, it's really scary. &gt;&gt; NICK: You have almost no bad photos when we shoot, and that's very rare. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, hey, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Different doll than I thought. How'd you get in here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean how did I get in here? I have a key. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You have a key to my house?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a key to everybody's house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love Kourtney's mother, but it's my first home, and her having a key and being able to barge in doesn't make me fell secure. All I want is a little privacy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I came over here on a mission. There's, um, a bunch of baby-proofing stuff going to go on here today. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you should have called me. I took care of it all. Every little outlet is baby-proofed. You know, you have to scoot them over before you can plug anything in. When did you get the key, by the way? &gt;&gt; KRIS: When you guys closed escrow. Scott, ♫ La, la, la, la. ♫ You cannot have this like this, because there's water out there, honey. Oh, oh, there's a frog! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's a frog. There's a frog. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it's George. Hello, my friend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See, this is my point. If the frog drowns in your pool, then... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So could your kid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just saying. 70 00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:56,943 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love comparing my son to a frog. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hear Kimberly! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ew, get your feet off the table. Now they're on the table. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Seriously? I've got socks. They're clean. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, doll. Here, Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, it looks fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's really hot. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Kenny, how did that photo shoot that you did, that ad campaign? &gt; KENDALL: Good. &gt;&gt; KIM: How'd the pictures turn out? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have to show you. You have to come in my office. By the way, Nick was the photographer on this shoot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And he said she would be the perfect runway model. &gt;&gt; KIM: She would. : Look at that photo. Oh, my God. She looks exactly like Ali MacGraw. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Doesn't she right here? I got a call from Luke at Wilhelmina, and he wants to take her to New York, but I can't go. And I can't send her there by herself. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sure you can take out a few days of your busy schedule for Kendall. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't, Kim. I can't. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll take her. I mean, she has to go. That's, like, such a good opportunity. Guess who is going to New York City? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Who? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall J! &gt;&gt; KIM: You. I am going to take you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait, really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You'll go with me? You'll take me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely. I want to introduce you to the fashion world of New York. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yay! I am so excited that Kim's taking me. I can't wait to go and see all the cool places and the cool things that are there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just remember, she's 15. She's got her whole life to do this stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sorry, but in the modeling world, you don't have a lot a of time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're still modeling, and your 30. That's 15 years from now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I model because I'm more like a personality. She's like a real model. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Doll? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Will you come down? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've got a little bone to pick with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A bone? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't need your mom having full access to this house with her own key. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? We all give each other keys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'd feel more comfortable just not having keys out there to other people. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just think her feelings are going to be really hurt. I don't know what I'm even going to say. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're going to say, "Mom, I love you, but for right now, I want my house to be private for my family. Do you mind if take the key back for right...?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. I just don't know how that's gonna go down. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got to get some cajones. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love these chairs and that coffee table. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Excuse me? How much is the horse? &gt;&gt; CLERK: $7,000. &gt;&gt; KRIS: $7,000? You could buy a real horse. &gt;&gt; CLERK: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm definitely a little bit anxious to ask my mom for the key back, but I need to come up with something creative so that she isn't offended. So, um, since I am getting, like, my furniture delivered and stuff... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...I... need my key back, 'cause it's my only extra key, and I need to give it to... the guy for the delivery, 'cause I'm gonna be out of town. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here you go. This is yours. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. Who knew you would have it on you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely feel a little bit guilty, but I'm also just relieved to have it back, and I never have to go through this again. Oh, I've seen that chair. It's kind of cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Looks like a vagina. &gt;&gt; KIM: How excited are you to go to New York? We're going to New York. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: We made it to New York. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, we're in New York! Are you excited to be here? I should be asking you. excited to be here? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome to the Empire Hotel, ladies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am so excited to be in New York. I'm looking around, taking everything in. It's gonna be fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: New York City! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, you're... &gt;&gt; KIM: To modeling. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, we have to flip my mattress. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Huh? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're flipping the mattress. Let's go. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: All right. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm gonna break a nail. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Wait, wait, wait. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, wait. What? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: There you go. Wait. There you go. All up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now what? &gt;&gt; ROB: Let's lean back... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe, it's going to hit your mirror! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, don't... &gt;&gt; ROB: No, it's all right. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Get it off of me! : My fingers! This is the heaviest ever! Ow! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: There you go. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's heavy. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, we're good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Family fun day! &gt;&gt; ROB: Myis hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, I don't like when you look at me and say provocative things. &gt;&gt; ROB: I was talking to Lamar. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're here. We made it safe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you guys gonna be doing for fun? &gt;&gt; KIM: We don't really have any time for that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just remember she's 15, Kim. Don't work her too hard. &gt;&gt; KIM: We gotta go. We have so much to do. Bye. Okay, first of all, your nails are so disgusting. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ew! &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank God I brought nail polish and files and all that. Kendall doesn't quite understand yet that this isn't a vacation. This is a trip for work. This isn't to play around. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can we go to, like, someplace fun while we're here, like, Broadway? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think we're gonna have time for a Broadway show. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But Kim, I never come here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but we have a shoot really early. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Let's go do something fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall, I promise I'll take you to go see the Statue of Liberty tomorrow, but you have a shoot early in the morning. Come on. Put your mask on, shower, put your pajamas on. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall has to get some rest 'cause she has lots 202 00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:47,227 of big meetings ahead of her. Mask on, pajamas on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, bugs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Guess what. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I got the key back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're lying! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Went furniture shopping, and I just said, "You can come over anytime, but you don't need a key to just, like, barge in." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you realize how hot and bothered you're getting me knowing that our house is finally ours again? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All I want to do is get your panties off, get my panties off, and have a pajama party. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When you talk like that, you make me so horned up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You look like you could be easily horned. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here's the key. Does this turn you on? 219 00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:36,009 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah, baby! You little dirty key taker. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's Central Park, right? Right there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There's the Empire State Building. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't it cool? 225 00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,462 See? We get to sightsee. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: From in the car. &gt;&gt; MAN: Look who's here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. Oh, God, this is so funny. I'm at my Sherri Hill photo shoot, and this is so exciting and so fun. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kim, this is the famous Sherri Hill. &gt;&gt; SHERRI: Kim, I'm so delighted to meet you. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? You, too. Kendall is so excited. &gt;&gt; SHERRI: She's our dream model. Her body is incredible. Those long legs. Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; MAN: Look at your sister, what has happened to her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MAN: She grew up in New York overnight. She looks amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: You look amazing. Exciting! &gt;&gt; MAN: Go. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's exactly how you would walk down the runway. &gt;&gt; Yes. Smile, you're in New York, baby. Come on. Give it. Yes, yes. Gorgeous, beautiful. Beautiful. Wow. Wow. Gorgeous, gorgeous smile. Boy, you grew up. Beautiful. This looks like a perfect... &gt;&gt; KIM: Chin. &gt;&gt; MAN: Laugh. Smile a little bit. Yeah, perfect. And smile. Oh, love your smile. Love your smile. Love your smile. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: She looks so beautiful. It's so crazy how she's transformed. I mean, she looks like a grown-up. &gt;&gt; MAN: Good job. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow. Kendall, this is gorgeous. I don't like this one. I think your face looks, like, too dark. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SHERRI: Hey, guys. You're doing beautifully. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SHERRI: It's looking good. One of our biggest clients... is coming in on Monday. We usually do a little runway show when they come. Have two or three models. Do you ever do runway or...? Never? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've never done it before, no. &gt;&gt; SHERRI: Really? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SHERRI: Any chance that we could talk you into that? &gt;&gt; KIM: That sounds amazing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think I have, like, cheerleader practice on Monday. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, we'll get out of it. It's fine. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Runway is just not what I want to do right now. It's a little intimidating to me, and I'm about to politely tell her no, and Kim just jumps in and says yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: We'll figure something out for sure. &gt;&gt; SHERRI: Okay. Okay, great. Okay, thanks. &gt;&gt; KIM: That'll be good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How many times do I have to do it? &gt;&gt; KIM: You just to it once right. Kendall, where are you going? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim, I really don't want to be here right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop embarrassing me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You make me feel really bad. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're getting the wrong impression. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't want me to have a key, and you lied to me. 279 00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,861 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want you to come over. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just got off the phone with my boyfriend Kris, and he's on his way over, which I'm so excited about, 'cause I really thought that this trip was going to be all about Kendall and work. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's baby girl! : Oh! How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe, I got you cupcakes. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Nice. &gt;&gt; KIM: And red velvet cookies. In a long distance relationship, when you do get to spend time together, you really, like, cherish that time when you're together. Do you want a massage? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, I'm good. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've been going to massage school. Do you want me to show you what I've learned? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right, come on, show me something. Did you really take classes though? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I just really wanted to hold your hand. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: So tell me how much you love me. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Okay, that much. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you this much. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right. Oh. 301 00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,717 &gt;&gt; KIM: My butt's hanging out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is it good? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, pretty good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like we've never used these plates. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, 'cause you've never cooked. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who's here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just came by. I wanted to come see Mason. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's taking a nap. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The door was unlocked? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a key. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thought you had the key back? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I did. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I made a copy of the key. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have everybody's keys, copies of keys, and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Then why did you give one back? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause she said she needed it to let somebody in. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Now I'm starting to realize. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You didn't tell me you wanted the key back so that I couldn't have a key. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't know how to tell you. I didn't want to hurt your feelings. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is what you did to get it back? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. I am so caught in this lie, I don't even know what to say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really messed up that you don't even want your own mom to have a key to your own house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want you to just barge in. I want you to come over any... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Barge in? We all have each other's keys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're getting the wrong impression. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't want me to have a key, and you lied to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want you to come over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just tell me what the truth is! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can take it, Kourtney-- I'm a big girl, I'm a strong girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is a calm household, and you're over here screaming... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, I don't feel very calm right now... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...so I think I'm gonna go. I'll see you guys later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, you're not calm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, bye. Got to go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She is so dramatic. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Are you Lu? &gt;&gt; LU: Hi. Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; LU: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. I'm Kim. &gt;&gt; LU: Nice to meet you, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: You, too. This is Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; LU: Hi, Kendall. Nice to meet you. Wow! I knew you were tall. I didn't know you were so tall. Oh, let's work, let's walk. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Cool. &gt;&gt; LU: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: So for Kendall to be prepared to walk for the buyers of Sherri Hill, I hired Lu, an amazing runway coach. She can give Kendall all the tips in the world. &gt;&gt; LU: Let's see what we're working with. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Walk. &gt;&gt; LU: Actually, that's great... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LU: ...'cause you got a little swagger, baby. No. Tell me something, Kendall. When you're shooting photographs, if you had on a long, sexy dress right now, show me the face you would give me in the photograph. &gt;&gt; KIM: Pretend like you're modeling. &gt;&gt; LU: That's the face I want. We know you got the young designers. I want you to get the old money. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's kind of hot in here. &gt;&gt; LU: Let's try it again. And stop and pose. Good. Now, twist, keep turning. Don't pick your feet up, Kendall. Let's try it again. And... go. Okay, stop. Can you do it again for me? Please? Try it again. Keep the photography face. And... let's try one more time. Head up... No, no, no, no, no. Seriously. Seriously. Please. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I start getting a little silly because I'm getting bored, and I just kind of want to be done. &gt;&gt; LU: Can we try it again? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Sure. &gt;&gt; LU: All right. Great. Thank you. Go. Okay, stop. Don't... Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall, this isn't a joke. You have to start taking this really seriously. Come on. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. &gt;&gt; LU: I don't think she's into this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall, this isn't funny. Kendall cannot, from the start, act like this diva and really difficult to work with. No one's gonna want to work with her. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How many times do I have to do it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you not want to be here? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Uh-uh. You know from the beginning, I've been scared to do runway, and, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you scared? You love to model. This is just an extension of modeling. Kendall? Kendall, where are you going? Where are you going? Come here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim, I really don't want to be here right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Come here. Come here. Stop embarrassing me. &gt;&gt; LU: If she wants to take it seriously one day... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; LU: ...call me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; LU: All rightie. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you for understanding. &gt;&gt; LU: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: There are honestly no words to describe how mad I am at Kendall right now. What was that about? Why did you just storm out? Like, what are you thinking?! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim, you've known that I haven't wanted to do this... &gt;&gt; KIM: You're not taking advantage of your opportunities! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Honestly, I feel like you're doing this for yourself. Kim originally wanted to do runway, but ended up being too short for it, so I think she's taking her fantasy out on me. You have this crazy dream that you want... &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't understand why you're embarrassing yourself... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim, you are honestly not listening to me! I have told you 500 times that I don't want to be doing this right now, and you just keep going on with these crazy things. You're honestly crazy right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're acting like a brat, when you're not, like... You just walk out on meetings, and you're not even doing, like... giving it your all. A young model's career is done at 25. You need to start acting a little bit more professional. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I came here for one reason-- to go to the photo shoot, and now you took my fun away from me?! &gt;&gt; KIM: What about the presentation tomorrow? You have your Sherri Hill thing that you're walking in. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Cancel it. I'm going home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall?! You are being such a brat! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you in such a bad mood? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney and Scott took my key away. 427 00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,214 It makes me feel like they don't trust me. 430 00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:16,495 &gt;&gt; Need to hang it up. Go get me a hammer and a nail. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You, stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are, like, screaming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you in such a bad mood? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm in a bad mood because Kourtney and Scott took my key away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They want their privacy. Why should...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're asking me why I'm cranky? That's why I'm cranky. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom can be pretty overbearing, and sometimes, us daughters who are doing our own thing-- we don't want our mom all up in our business all the time. There's no rule that says you have to give your mom a key to your house. If she doesn't want to give you a key, that's not an attack on you. You got to relax a little. 449 00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:57,536 &gt;&gt; KRIS: It makes me feel like they don't trust me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who's here? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you gonna, like, put your bag upstairs? You're still ignoring me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Little Kimmy. Want some vegetable soup? &gt;&gt; KIM: Ugh! I am so annoyed with Kendall. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. Come on, you got to back off about Kendall. &gt;&gt; KIM: Back off? What do you mean? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall called me in tears last night. Before you left, I told you, don't push her. And what did you do? You went to New York, you wind up pushing her. It's not your job to push her. &gt;&gt; KIM: But it is my job as her big sister to, like, introduce her to new things that she's not comfortable with. At least if she can try it and tells me she hates it... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: ...she can move on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...it's my job to push her, not yours. This is exactly what I was worried about. She's in New York City with all these big modeling people. Who wouldn't be intimidated? You're like a stage mom, Kim. Just leave her alone. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to be a stage mom. Like, that's not what I was trying to do. I was trying to help her. Sometimes Kendall just seems so mature, I forget sometimes that she really is just a kid. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Put yourself in her shoes. She's 15 years old. What were you doing when you were 15? Running around in school, chasing little boys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Come in. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I talk to you for a sec? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just wanted to tell you, like, I feel really bad, and I'm sorry for coming off aggressive and super hard, like a crazy stage mom, and, like, push you into runway modeling. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I just wanted to say, I love you, and I'm really proud of you, and I'm sorry if New York was, like, so miserable. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, thanks, Kim. It wasn't miserable, but it could have been a little better, but... Kim went a little crazy in New York, but it's hard for me to stay mad at Kim, because I know she has my best interests in mind. &gt;&gt; KIM: No to stage moms, yes to long, sexy legs. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yay! &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Love you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Coming. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who's here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I just came to see what you guys were up to. Where's Kourtney? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kitchen. Come on in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? Thanks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I came over to personally take this key off my little keychain and give it back. I won't be barging in on you guys anymore, so you don't have to worry about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that the only copy that you made? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Only copy. I'm gonna smile and give them their key back, but this is the biggest mistake these guys could have made. They pretty much shot themselves will be a time when they need me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This kind of communication is really working for me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll see you guys later. Hasta la vista. Don't miss me too much. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; MAN: So, what brings you in today? &gt;&gt; KIM: My sisters have dared me to get a butt X-ray. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: People get kind of confused when they call here. I just think it might be a good idea to change my name to Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's such a little fame whore. You can't be a groupie. You can't be Bruce Jenner's sucker and now you want to be the Kardashian sucker.
