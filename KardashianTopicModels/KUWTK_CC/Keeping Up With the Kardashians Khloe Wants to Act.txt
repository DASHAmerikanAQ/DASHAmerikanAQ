- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How'd those work? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really tight? Try those, but I'll also grab you another. You want a darker wash? You know, I love the store. I'm so passionate about it. But sometimes it does get boring. ♫ Boring, boring My life is so boring. ♫ Hello. Dash. You want to buy it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're welcome. Kim's role at Dash was to be there with me every day and help me out. &gt;&gt; KIM: See you later. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But... &gt;&gt; Blow hair! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim is sitting doing photo shoots and lounging around and traveling from here to there. You know, doing really exciting things. And I would love to be doing that. I would love to just do something creative. So what I was thinking. I know some of my friends that go to this "acting class"... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, so you really want to take acting classes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, it would be fun. You don't think I would be a good actress as dramatic as I am in life? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I think you would be so good, but I've never heard you say that before. I think you should totally try acting. You would be really good at it. Let me show you something. Give me your hand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? For acting? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, it's an acting trick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, wait. Just watch. It's an acting trick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, stop! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow! Your love bracelet really hurt! Alright, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have you seen my sandals? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What sandals? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, those black ones. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce is the anti-fashion. He really is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'm gonna go run your errands. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't leave the house looking like this anymore. It's so embarrassing. You look like... a grandpa. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My style philosophy is whatever is on top of the pile, usually it winds up on my body. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look like you're representing the homeless community of Los Angeles. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll see you later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, Bruce, it's embarrassing. You know, there's only so much that, you know, I can take. Ugh. He's got clothes in his closet from the '80s. Ew. Yuck. Turtleneck. Wait. I could wear these. Nah, maybe not. Ah! beautiful. Hi, guys! Let's just get rid of it. Let's start over. You guys want any clothes? &gt;&gt; I don't know... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, not so much? I'm gonna hire somebody who I've heard a lot about, and I think that he might have a really good, positive effect on the way that Bruce dresses. Wouldn't it be great to have somebody totally dress you? &lt;&lt; BRUCE: I-I don't want a stylist. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not doing so good on your own. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't need a stylist. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you know what? Yeah, you do. Honey, you have a great sense of style. You just don't know it yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been thinking that I want to start take acting classes. Like, I'm at the store all the time and... I'm just getting bored there. I love the store, but it's like how long can I just sit in the air-conditioned box. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You would be a great actress. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just doing something that I can use my creative energy in, so I don't have to kill my sisters all the time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; ERIC ARCHIBOLD: Hello. How are you? How is everything? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You must be Eric. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yes, yes, yes, how are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Eric has dressed people like J-Lo and Puffy, and he's really a big deal in the stylist world. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is Eric. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Eric's gonna take care of me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, yeah. I-I thought that he could take you out and get you styled up, doll. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Where'd you get that shirt? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I like the shirt. &gt;&gt; ERIC: I can't seem to get past it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The shirt and the shoes match, see? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know how comfortable Bruce is gonna be having<i>anybodydress him.</i> &gt;&gt; ERIC: We got to lose the shirt, we have to lose the pants. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But then, on top of that, having this fabulous gay guy dress him... &gt;&gt; ERIC: All righty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where do we start? &gt;&gt; ERIC: I'll take your measurements. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Start with the neck. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yeah. You've got really long arms. That's sorta sexy. Are you relaxed? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think so. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want you guys to come out here and meet this stylist, Eric. He's fabulous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; ERIC: I need to get the in-seam of your pants. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; ERIC: I don't mind going down. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How 'bout those Lakers, Eric? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, hey, hey! Yeah, why are you so stiff? Calm down. &gt;&gt; ERIC: I'm old-fashioned. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need a shot before you do this. You really need to calm down. &gt;&gt; ERIC: You know, let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I really need to talk to you. &gt;&gt; ERIC: I'm going to bring you back a whole new man. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It'll be fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not going with this guy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We love to shop. You'll have a great time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE:How can I say this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, I don't want to dress too fluffy, and I think this guy probably would be a little bit on the fluffy side. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give it a chance. He's really nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Eric seems like a nice enough guy, but I don't think we're gonna be playing golf together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you, doll. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Thank you. It'll be great. It'll be great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have fun with them. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's just a little uptight. You'll be fine, baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Help. &gt;&gt; KIM: Want to see this new watch I bought myself? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You needed another one, didn't you? No, it's really nice. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't it, like, to die? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It<i>is.</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: Where is... Khloe and Kourtney? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Um, they're in Smooch. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're supposed to get this Web site up. That was, like, gonna be Khloe's responsibility, you know? Literally, I think it's been five months. I keep on saying, "The Web site will be up, the Web site will be up," and it's embarrassing and I'm, you know... We have been trying to get this Dash Web site done for so long and I, financially, am taking care of the Web site and Khloe's job is to make sure that everything's done. Khloe's really slacking, and we're really missing out on a really good opportunity to help our store. Do you have the phone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello, Smooch. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Khlo. Will you come over here, you and Kourt? I need to talk to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kimberley needs to talk to us, you and I. &gt;&gt; KIM: She just hangs up on me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do I look fat? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me see. It's like 20 pounds overweight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're such a skinny bitch. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm gonna stop before we go. I'm gonna make one stop on my way. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Are we making a pit stop? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am in<i>norush to do</i> this whole style thing and go shopping. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Not Beverly Hills. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll be back in a second. It's time to stall. Rich! What's happening? &gt;&gt; RICH: How you been? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love all this technology. I got to work on my setup. &gt;&gt; ERIC: This is weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's the emerge? What's the 911, hon? &gt;&gt; KIM: We were supposed to do this Web site, maybe six, seven months ago. It's really unprofessional of us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the final step. I've done everything else. &gt;&gt; KIM: To figure out what inventory we want on the Web site and to get pictures up on the Web site. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you want me to do, do that by myself? Kim, youthink that this is so easy and like, there's a lot of other work. It's not just like I have nothing to do all day long but a Web site. I have a ton of other things I want to do other than just sit here all day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, acting, hosting. I would love to be going to photo shoots all day long getting glammed up like you. &gt;&gt; KIM: So do it. No one's stopping you. Go do it. But don't act like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's going to watch the store? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll do it. Go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so go. I would love to see you do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. I'll gladly do it. I've done eBay for years. If it's too hard of a job for her, I can do it. It's not that hard. Go do it all. I'm more than happy for you to go and do whatever you want to &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would love to. So keep your ass here instead of coming once every two months. Why are you so lazy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not lazy. Itaught you how to work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come to the store more. I need yourhelp! &gt;&gt; ERIC: I'm calling Kris. &gt;&gt; RICH: Right on. Right on. &gt;&gt; ERIC: I've been in the car for 15 minutes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've got a tournament coming up. Come on, Eric, and I got to hit. &gt;&gt; ERIC: We have to go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Eric, if I'm going shopping, you're taking a swing here. &gt;&gt; ERIC: I'll take one swing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, full swing. &gt;&gt; ERIC: It's a photo shoot. Isn't that cute? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're not looking for cute. We're looking for... &gt;&gt; ERIC: Well, I'm looking for cute. Let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think I can get out of this thing, 'cause my wife won't let me and the kids won't let me, so... &gt;&gt; ERIC: We're here. I'm excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, the things you do for love. Right now there's a million other things I'd rather be doing. You know I'm uncomfortable. I don't want him to dress me like, you know... like he might dress, put it that way. &gt;&gt; ERIC: It's a great store. Men's collection is amazing. Let's start picking some things out. These are really great over dress shirts. That one's so you. Look at this trench coat. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Scarves are always great. How about this bag? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A male purse? That's more you. You would wear that. Come on, I can't see me in that. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Extra large in that. We're piling up. We're having... this is great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So it's your big night off. You want to go grab dinner? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, actually... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe a sake bomb? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I mean, that sounds really nice, but actually I found these... acting classes. I think with my night off, I just want to try acting. It'll be fun-- just go to an acting class. There is one tonight at 7:30. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you're coming. Sorry. Oh, God I'm dying... I'm shaking in my boots. &gt;&gt; BOBBI CHANCE: We have two new actors in class tonight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, I'm just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's here for moral support, 'cause I'm shaking in my boots. &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: All right, you should be, okay. So let's have everybody on stage, please. Find a place for yourself. What we're going to do is just to get a sound, okay? Just take a deep breath, and let out a sound. Ah... Okay. Okay, Khloe, I see you're already smiling. And, um, there's no smiling, okay? That sound, let's give it a word. Um, "hat." What annoys you? Give it to the word "hat," and let it come from here. Watch. Hat. Hat. Hat... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hat. Hat. &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: Hat. Stop laughing. Brynn, set an example please. What ticks you off? Look where she goes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Actors really, really take their craft way serious. &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: All right, go ahead. &gt;&gt; BRYNN: Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: Cut, cut. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They start shaking and twitching and having like anxiety attacks over the word "hat." &gt;&gt;: Hat! Hat! &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: Okay, cut. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't know it was that intense. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm tired of waiting for Khloe to do the Web site. And I'm going to take matters into my own hands. It's now my job and my responsibility to take all these pictures. I figure I can work a few hours and get it done-- once and for all. &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: This is what I would like to see-- as a love scene, as something very tender. Because you care about him and you waited for him all night. And you love him. Action. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where were you? You were supposed to call. I waited. &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: Get in there, get in there with him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're a liar and a horrible friend. I don't need people like you anymore. &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: Come on, Khloe, get in there! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And the boy sticks his tongue down my throat. Which is not an acting rule. Then if you don't do it right... she makes you do it a million more times. &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: Action. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you see me? I'm... &gt;&gt; Can you see me?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you see me?! There was so much adrenaline going through my blood. It's just crazy. Like I can't think about anything but being there. It actually feels good. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Is there a VIP changing room for us? &gt;&gt; Upstairs. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Thank you so much. Come on up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I get VIP? Whoa. &gt;&gt; ERIC: This is gorgeous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is nice. Hey, Eric. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No peeking. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Why would I peek? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Eric. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yes? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ready. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yes, reveal. You look amazing. Turn around so I can see those lines. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm looking in the mirror, and you know what? The old guy's looking pretty good. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Oh, wow. Now, that's what I'm talking about. ? Wearing all my pretty clothes... ? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, to new clothes. &gt;&gt; ERIC: That's pretty cool. I like that trench coat on you. We should get that. That looks pretty good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what? There's some pretty good stuff here. &gt;&gt; ERIC: That is awesome. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! I feel like a major movie star. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Rock with it, roll with &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is the new me, babe. I need this. Just shut those girls up. I realize, you know what? I really didn't have anything to worry about. Eric seems to know what he's doing. Let's go, Eric! We are outta here! &gt;&gt; ERIC: Ooh! We're going out. We're going to go to one of my spots to have a drink after this. Just to relax, you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Just a quick one. Then I gotta get home. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yes. I'll make sure it's quick. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yes. I'm good at quickies. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's good to know. That's good to know, Eric. That's good to know! &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: Kourtney, you want to try it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh! Go, Kourtney! Double action. &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: Okay. Sisters! Nothing better. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're doing it against each other? &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: Yeah, against each other. Really get into a place. Show her what you feel. And action. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop wearing my leather jacket! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your clothes don't fit me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop wearing my clothes! &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: Say whatever you want. Whatever is being felt, just make it real, okay? 'Cause what I saw was bull... Make it real. Maybe it's not a heavy enough topic. Make it heavier. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you work more at the store? This is going to be so easy for I'll pretend it's Kim. &gt;&gt; BOBBIE: Call her on it. Action. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you so lazy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not lazy. Itaught you how to work. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come to the store more. I need yourhelp! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have the ... store. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't work for a month, and disappear for two years! We've been open for two years! Oh, got nothing to say now, bitch. Come to work! All those people are there because they love it. That's their passion. And they do not think that-- you look silly. They're actually really supportive. You can let loose and be silly and... Kourtney and I had the best time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've never been here before. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Oh, this is one of my favorite places. This is The Abbey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, really? All right! &gt;&gt; ERIC: You're gonna have a really, really amazing time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, we'll sit right here. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yeah. This is my pit stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is your pit stop? &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. In all the experiences that I've been through in my life, I've never been in a gay bar. &gt;&gt; JESSE: Hi, guys. How are you tonight? My name's Jesse. Welcome to The Abbey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My name's Bruce. &gt;&gt; JESSE: Bruce, nice to meet you. Jesse. Bruce Jenner, right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; JESSE: <i>Can't Stop the Music!</i> Awesome! Give me some sugar. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: <i>Can't Stop the Music!</i> He's seen <i>Can't Stop the Music,</i> a movie I did years ago. A large gay following. I did it with the Village People. Yes, the star of <i>Can't Stop the</i> <i>Music needs a Corona.</i> <i>Can't Stop the Music has</i> become, like, a cult movie. It's like<i>The Rocky Horror Show</i> and <i>Can't Stop the Music.</i> They still show it in theaters. : <i>Can't Stop the Music.</i> Do you know what? Eric was a great guy. He's worked very hard. The scary part is I'm actually excited about going home and letting the kids and Mom and everybody see the new clothes I got. So, all in all, it was a fun day. Good seeing you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have a good day now. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Okay, you have a good evening. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am exhausted. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm trying to do the descriptions for our Web site for all this stuff and take pictures. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know... Am I supposed to, like, take down all the sizes that we have in the store? I don't really know what to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a lot of work because it's a great amount of detail. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've been in the store for hours. I'm exhausted. My feet hurt. Oh, this is just, like, a lot more work than I thought! It's just... it's a whole process. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One person can't take care of the entire site, especially when you're setting something up new. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, Mom, I have a really long night ahead of me. I'm going to get going. I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't forget... &gt;&gt; KIM: This is so hard! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why are they scattered around? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! The door was open. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is a disaster! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You tired? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: EXHAUSTED. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! Bruce! Look at him! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, meet me in the bedroom! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You really look like George Clooney! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I actually think, with the jacket, it's more Matt Damon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce looks so handsome, so fantastic, <i>NOT</i> fluffy, and he looks like he really likes the way he looks, so I think Eric did a great job. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then we went and got something to eat. We went to this place-- The Abbey. Do you guys know what The Abbey is? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a gay bar. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's kind of a gay bar, I didn't know what it was. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Kind of"? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But while I was there, at least I did get compliments on my shoes and my sweater. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We are, like, in shock. Like, is this the same Bruce ? I think that this new outfit gave him a new outlook on life. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Did you take some people home from the gay bar? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I didn't take anybody home from the gay bar. so cold, it's freezing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My God! Where are the mannequins? That's odd. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why are they scattered around? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! The door was open. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is a disaster. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and I are opening the stores, and it literally looks like we got robbed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, who closed up last night? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, did you leave the store like this, or did something happen? &gt;&gt; KIM: I've been trying to take pictures. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why would you leave mannequins' arms everywhere? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This isn't your home closet. &gt;&gt; KIM: I kind of have it a little confused, but I will figure it out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, we open in FIVE minutes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'll clean it up. I've been here since last night. It's taking me hours and hours and hours. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So are you admitting that it's not as easy as it seems to set up a Web site? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a lot harder than I thought. I get that. I'm trying my best. I'm trying to make it easier on all of us. Khloe works really hard, and I need to give her a little bit more credit for everything that she does, 'cause I certainly can't do this by myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I really appreciate you trying and trying to help take some stress off of us. &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't realize how hard it was. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is hard. I think Kim is realizing-- that it really is hard, and I'm not just bullher and making up stories on why the Web site isn't done. Now I feel like all three of us could do the Web site together, and we'll get it done right. Oh, baby, I did it! &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Khlo, how was that acting class you guys did? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The most amazing thing ever. I don't know. It's, like, it was the scariest thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I would die! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then... then she says, "Okay, let it out of you." Bobbie says, "Let it out." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, Khloe got so crazy mad, yelling at the person, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And everyone started clapping. They were, like, "Yes! We got it out of you!" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The acting teacher was "Yes!" &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe totally inspires I'm, like, proud of her, because I wish I could do that. I wish I had it in me. I just wish I could be like her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, say "hat," and be annoyed. Ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know if I want to do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And action. Hat! Hat! Hat! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hat. Hat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say it annoyed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, if we're, like,fat-assed whore! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Youbitch. Chubby! Come on! Come on, chub-chub! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hat! Hat! Good job. <i>Next on Keeping Up With the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; TRACY: Kris, this is Tracy from the Los Angeles Sparks Old-School Crew Dancers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to be a cheerleader?
