- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: "We're thrilled to invite you to your newest adventure in Greece." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Toga! Toga! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah! &gt;&gt; ALL: Toga! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brody wasn't invited to Greece? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every time I do include him, he is busy, or he flakes. &gt;&gt; ROB: Brandon and Leah are coming, so I know you're invited. Just haven't got the memo yet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got the flights for Brody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cool! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not the evil step-monster that you guys think I am. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Have fun with the crazy women. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott decided to stop in London and then meet up with us towards the end of our trip. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so pretty here! &gt;&gt; KRIS: To die for. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Rob gets me all fired up to come. I'm here now, and he's not. It's not like I was even properly invited. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: There's a lot that Brody and Kris need to hash out. There is a lot of history there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been trying to reach out to you, and you don't even respond. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am seriously concerned about how the rest of the vacation is gonna go. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... We want to name our kid with a "K" name, because Kanye and I are "K"s. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm feeling "North West." &gt;&gt; KIM: It's pretty and cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Allie sent me a picture of Scott leaving the club with some girls. It doesn't make me happy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are they hiding like that? That looks so bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, dolls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You got to look at me and go, "Baby, you look so beautiful." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't go that far. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please. Sexual favors! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I'll try. You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoa! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Brody takes me the wrong way. Like, he doesn't get my humor. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You oiling me up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, that is so weird. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Whoa! Hey! I have a serious issue, and I'll tell you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know you do. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I think it's time for Kris and I to actually have that talk that we've always needed to have. I don't feel like you've ever given twoabout Brandon and I. It's your family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't understand. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, no, hear me out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is one of the most 49 00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:50,344 hurtful attacks, I think, that has ever been thrown my way. â™« &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so cute in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The only thing, like, if I brought Lamar here, he just couldn't fit. On the beds. Preventative. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to try Lizard Legs? &gt;&gt; KHLOE:What is it? Lizard Legs? &gt;&gt; KIM: Stuff. You'll love it. Here, come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you get up? &gt;&gt; KIM: I go like this, in the middle of the night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You roll to the side? How fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, come here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's called Lucky Legs, not Lizard Legs. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I'm calling this Lizard Legs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:We can call it Lizard Legs. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, this stuff... "Lucky Legs." Okay. Give me your thigh. You'll die. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you feel it tingle? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It does, oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I put this all over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'd put that all over my body. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good enough for Kim, it's good enough for me. Why don't you lay down and I'll put it on your feet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. 75 00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,317 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't get horny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who are you calling? Rob? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Of course, he didn't pick up. Yo, Roberto. What is the deal, man? Why aren't you returning my text messages? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're such a bitch! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Come on, Rob. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Call me back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's so weird when he gets, like, Debbie Downer. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It upset me that Rob didn't show up, because we all want Rob there. Especially me. He's my wingman. I need Rob there to be a barrier between Kris and I, so... I'm a little nervous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, Rob claims he didn't want to come because he doesn't have, like, a good body and can't be around all of us. It's like, everyone has insecurities. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to be in a bathing suit in front of everyone. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Not only that, he didn't even need to be. He doesn't have to get into a bathing suit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: E-Exactly. &gt;&gt; LEAH: There's people snorkeling down there. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what you guys are going to do? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: 'Cause it looks so real. &gt;&gt; LEAH: We. We are going to go do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I can't do that. The last time Kourtney and I decided to do anything in the water, I had a panic attack. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Something just touched me! Not my idea of fun. Korky. Do you want to go on the boat? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'd like to get a tan. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. We could relax and lounge around at home. I want to be in "only live once" mode. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I for sure am not putting on a bikini. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So far, the Kardashian side of the family has just been, like, lounging, while the Jenner side of the family has been, like, rock climbing. While I'm here, I want to create some great memories. Okay. Swear on the YOLO pact that you're not gonna chicken out on me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. 119 00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,493 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: YOLO pact in full effect. &gt;&gt; RUSSELL: Look how much taller you are than me. That's amazing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know, right? &gt;&gt; RUSSELL: So, you're going to Greece tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. I am at Russell James's exhibit in Hollywood right now, and it's going amazing. It's so fun. The exhibit is incredible. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: On the cover. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; RUSSELL: Yeah, she's on the cover. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You are dressed in this, right? &gt;&gt; RUSSELL: Yes. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm very excited. Kylie, me and my dad are going to Greece tomorrow morning. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good job. &gt;&gt; RUSSELL: Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to work with your daughter. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: With age-appropriate pictures for my daughter, yeah. &gt;&gt; RUSSELL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: At the moment. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: At-- for the moment? Yeah, no, no, no, they're gonna stay age-appropriate. &gt;&gt; RUSSELL: All right, so I'll see you later on? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; RUSSELL: See you later on. Okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, see you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Off to Greece. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. And I've never been on vacation with Brandon, Brody or with any of them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It'll be a good trip. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I'm excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: All right, let's go socialize. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just don't be running 148 00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,787 around like that, all right? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: All right. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Look how pretty this is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So pretty. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey, what is that thing over there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's a mermaid on the rock. &gt;&gt; KATRINA: Oh, let me see them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, I like naked people. Can we literally drive by them and look? &gt;&gt; KATRINA: Uh, you want to see the size? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: That's so rude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, he's looking at me looking at him. &gt;&gt; KATRINA: Okay, I'm gonna give you the wetsuits so you can change. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, I forgot a hair tie. &gt;&gt; KATRINA: Oh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My big butt. It's very big. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KATRINA: This is funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The spear-fishing lady thinks it's, like, the most humorous thing that my butt cannot fit into this wetsuit. &gt;&gt; KATRINA: Do you mind if I touch you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you can touch me. Just push it in. She's, like, touching it like, "Oh my God, it's squishy!" &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KATRINA: I think I lost ten pounds. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: These people are half, like, mermaids. I don't want to go in there. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I got dinner! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Kourt, if you go in, I'll go in. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You just got to jump in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, hold hands. Hold hands. &gt;&gt; KATRINA: Are you comfortable? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hold hands, you moron. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Like, we've just got to do it. Like... we can't be, like, showed out by the Jenners. Like, we got to do this. We have to YOLO it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: One, two... three. The water is so cold. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna drown! Oh, my God! Kourtney! Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where's the ladder? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Emergency! Emergency! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've never experienced something so cold. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm proud that we did this. At least we had fun, guys. &gt;&gt; KATRINA: So you ready to go back? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Sure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's blow this hot 199 00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,375 dog stand. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Cool, I'm down, yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Whoa! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Holy It iscold. &gt;&gt; LEAH: So, are you okay that Scott's not here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You are? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. He gets, like, anxious, and he's like, "Oh, I can't spend that much time with your family." Like, he just thinks it's setting himself up for disaster. He probably would get annoyed and get anxious... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and, like, cuss somebody out, or, like... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who knows, like, what would happen? Part of me is like, I wish he would just come, but I'm... I'm fine; like, I like hanging out with everyone, and I... &gt;&gt; LEAH: I know, but it's also vacation, the whole family's here. It's about making the memories together, and also looking back at the photos and seeing everybody was there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Especially with the kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Mason and Penelope, and to have everybody together. Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ah, my entire face. &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's just a little salt water. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. It's good for you. It's good for my skin. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm staying in London a few days and see some of my friends. It turns out that I book a few appearances while I'm in London. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Scott! â™« &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course, I feel a little guilty that I'm neglecting Kourtney and everybody. But the truth is I don't also want to ruin her trip either, which usually happens on these long family trips where everybody gets on each other's 233 00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:27,894 nerves, and that's not what I'm looking to do right now. Buenos dias. &gt;&gt; LEAH: How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How'd you sleep? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Good morning. Every time I tried to fall asleep, I'd hear, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me, too, I said that, too. So, Allie sent me a picture of Scott and Chris leaving the club with some girls. This is Scott, I... I think that's Nate. I try to be very understanding with Scott being an only child and not being able to be with my family for too long of a period of time, but it's just disappointing that he let these photographs happen, even though I know he didn't do anything. Scott's just putting himself in a bad situation when he knows better. I was like, "Cool pics." And then he's like, "They're not good, they're horrible actually." And I was like, "Okay, that's good." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I deserve a couple days off in London, especially before I embark on the family dreaded trip. Oh, yeah, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I have a serious issue and I'll tell you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I worry about, like, how you feel about me now as a mom. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, that's-that's a lie. 258 00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,844 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Swear to God. I feel so defeated. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: This is Mykonos. Welcome. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How are you today? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We made it to Greece. The birthplace of the Olympics. I'm excited. I think it's gonna be a lot of fun. : Greece, baby. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know how you're, like, talking right now. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, what in the world? Mom, that's really scary. Mom, stop-- that's scary. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't like it. No, stop! This is just ridiculous and embarrassing. Wait, that's so scary. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How gorgeous is this? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My mom is crazy. Like, for real, that's really ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You look scary. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Jesus Christ. Who the hell are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. I want to switch things up a little bit, so I've decided to debut my gorgeous new Grecian locks to my family. Whoa! This would be so great in Greece. This is a whole new world of possibilities. I just thought I'd try something, like, different. No? You don't like it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What's up? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Whoa, look who it is! You guys are finally here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Finally. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The Brodster! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! Well, hey! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you comfortable? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm very excited that my father and my two little sisters have finally showed up. I don't think we've ever had that type of family-bonding trip in our lives. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yummy. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What's going on with your boobs? &gt;&gt; KIM: When your skin stretches, it, like, itches like crazy, but if you scratch it, that's how you get stretch marks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You learn something every day around here, don't you? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, my God. Really? It's that itchy? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, it's like... oh, my God. It's so itchy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, dolls. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow, you look so different. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know, it's crazy how different she looks. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are so ridiculous. She looks so crazy. I do not recommend this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your hair's kind of wearing on me. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Growing on you or wearing on you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's as far as I can go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want something to wear on somebody. I want it to be like bam! Got to look at me in the eyes and go, "Baby, you look so beautiful tonight I can't even take it." Okay, just say it. Just say it, come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just go. Please? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't go that far. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I'll say it. You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sexual favors! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew, Mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoa! &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't even really know what to think when Kris makes those comments. Kris and I never really connected, you know, growing up. But I don't feel comfortable enough with Kris to be able to bring these kind of things up to her. You like it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was just trying to spice things up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a different look. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Brody can appreciate my hair. 326 00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,287 &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's... yeah, it's... I don't mind it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Good night. I see you yawning, too, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah, that's a good sign. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm doing it. 331 00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,233 This is the sign. No dessert. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I ask you a question about Brody? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He takes me the wrong way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe if you're feeling that way, why don't you make a little extra effort? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like I have been, but he judges me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Uh, oh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yep. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You oiling me up? 340 00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:27,827 Kris is being overly nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so gross. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you like this bathing suit, or is it too boobalicious on the side? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I like it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why, thanks. You did the turban. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. I'm trying to be Grecian. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When in Greece. Hey, so can I ask you a question about Brody? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was just wondering. I feel like he's disappointed or upset about the fact that I didn't invite him on this trip. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who invited him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob, and then... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob invited him and then Rob didn't come? Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like he sort of judges me. I mean, it's always after a remark because I think that a lot of times, he takes me the wrong way. Like, he doesn't get my humor. We're so comfortable with each other, all of us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want him to, you know, be part of the family and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We haven't spent a lot of time with him over the years, so I feel like everyone needs to, like, spend time together and build that trust up. And those things do take time. Maybe if you're feeling that way, I think this is, like, the perfect opportunity. Why don't you make a little extra effort to really spend 367 00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,210 some time with Brody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Be nice. Having a blended family is never easy. And I feel like I have been painted as not exactly positive all the time in Brody's eyes. If one of us is gonna make a break here, then I've got to be the bigger person and really reach out to Brody. I want him to be one of us. Family comes first. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everybody, cheers to Greece. Cheers to Greece, everyone. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Cheers, everybody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: YOLO. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I know they're all planning to go on the boat, but I was wondering if you might want to maybe go explore the island? Do you think that's bad? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I don't think they'll care. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I would just rather see the island and hang out together. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'm down. I'm down. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Later on, everybody's going on the yacht. And I know it's a family vacation, but we haven't had, like, a second alone, and I feel like it would be nice just to go explore a little bit and have a little romantic dinner and have fun together. Would you guys kill us if Brandon and I didn't go on the boat? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you want to go on the boat? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Because we want to go have a little romantic day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are so cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, you should. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, take a couple hours and have a honeymoon. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If this was a family trip with just me and him and our kids, then Scott would be here. And I know that if Scott was here that we could've had alone time, but he didn't believe me. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Okay. So you guys aren't upset? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Brody is. You can tell how depressed he looks. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I know. Brody, are you okay? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'll be all right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Brody's like, "Don't leave me alone with them." &gt;&gt; KRIS: This doesn't get you out of the family video. &gt;&gt; LEAH: We will be in the video. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're doing a music video on the boat. Brody, you'll be the star of the video, so take your shirt off. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You can come with us if you want. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I have no idea why Brandon and Leah would do something like this. I need them on the yacht with me. Definitely my comfort zone. 412 00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,880 Oh, geez. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get ready. Oh! This is amazing! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. Bruce. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hello. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am shocked how big this yacht is. It's incredible, and I'm so excited to spend the entire day on it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go. We need champagne. 420 00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,705 Come on! Oh! Oh, yeah, Brody! I think it's difficult trying to figure out what your relationship is between a stepparent and a stepchild. You have to really work at it and have continual communication, which I haven't always had with Brody, unfortunately. And all I really want is for everybody to have a really good time, especially Brody and I. That's what's really important to me on this trip. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's Kim? Why does she miss all this? I'm gonna go get her. Kimmy, can you please come upstairs? You are missing out on the b... Kim, you have no idea of the views outside, upstairs. It's a whole rooftop deck. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just my back is killing me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll rub your back. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I've turned into a different person. I was never tired my whole pregnancy. Now I'm, like, exhausted. My feet are so swollen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think you understand what you're missing outside. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just feel like a huge roly-poly. And I have to move? It's just gonna be really hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you pretending to be asleep? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just so tired. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a world of gorgina. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Have you heard from Scott today? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I talked to him yesterday that one time, and I haven't talked to him since. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And, like, just to with him, I was writing text messages like, "You must feel really good about yourself right now." &gt;&gt; BRODY:You said that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is just so breathtakingly beautiful to be here on this yacht. And we were trying to book this yacht before we even came, and this is, like, the one thing that Scott was so excited about. But this is just another thing Scott's missing out on. Oh, I just got a... he just said, "Tried calling you a few times. Wanted to check on the kids to see how they were liking the trip." Yeah, you really cared. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I mean, honest opinion, I think that's... disrespectful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I can only imagine how much fun they must be having on the humongous yacht, but it's important not only to make those memories with the family but for us to have memories of our own in a romantic way. We're having fun, and it's nice to be alone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that the baby's name? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, you just come up, Kim, all of a sudden? Yeah, where did Kim just come from? I'm feeling North. North West. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me, too. Me, too! It's pretty and cool, and it's not just, like, tomboyish. It's just good. &gt;&gt; KIM: If we name our kid with a "K" name-- which is kind of what we want, mainly just because Kanye and I are "K"s-- but then our kid, if it's a "K," then they'll call us the KKK. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I mean, that's a little crazy though. Oh, she's-she's up. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. How long have I been asleep? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, three hours. Kanye and I, we're designing the baby's playroom, and our... Kourtney's like, "You need a playroom." And Kanye's like, "I didn't have a playroom. I just played in my room and then I cleaned it up." You know? Like, how much do you give them, you know? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. You're gonna be a good mom, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. I think Kanye will be really good with that. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He seems like he'll be a good dad. &gt;&gt; KIM: He always says, "There's nothing more that I love in this world than you and me and myself." So imagine the combination of the two. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do leave my ego at the door. And on this trip, I want Brody to be a part of my family. I hope to be able to let him see what I'm like when I'm having a good time and I'm bonding with my family. Anybody want any sunscreen? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Brody, you're getting all burnt. You want some sunscreen? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Am I burnt? No, I'm good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, no, you need some. No, you need some. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay. Uh, oh... You oiling me up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yep. You feel really hot, by the way. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's 'cause I've been baking in the sun. No, 'cause of the sun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, you can fry an egg on your back. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Epic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My family, we're very affectionate, touchy-feely. We don't have, like, boundaries with each other. But my mom with Brody-- that's not your biological son, and you guys are, like, trying to get out of this awkward zone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your dad has the exact same back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, that is so weird of you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Take a little... Oh! : Hey! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so gross. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I want to think that Kris is being overly nice. I don't want to think anything else besides that. 518 00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:20,326 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right, guys. You're a little crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo, do you want to jump off together? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Brody really just set the YOLO bar pretty high. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why did I even mention this? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Got a little awkward the other day on the boat. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Why do you think that happened? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I think that she doesn't think I like her. I might've thought that Kris was the reason that I didn't see my 528 00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:46,585 father as much and kind of painted her like a villain. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want my own. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm gonna go, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Kendall! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go for it! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris Jenner! Isn't Mom so insane? Like, what's going on with her? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have no idea what's going on with her. She's just... getting full of herself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love that my mom has this energy of being younger than her age, but then she starts acting more teenage-like with this wig on. If this is her midlife crisis, I just need it to be over. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim, will you take a picture of me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want me to join you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'll jump on the back! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Come on the back with me! &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm coming! Stay out of my way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you kidding? 548 00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,623 Got to get my camera! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is truly Bruce's son. Like, what freaks in the world. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo, do you want to jump off together? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you kidding? Would you ever? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, I would never from here. We could go down one more. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? He did it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Brody really just set the YOLO bar pretty high. We got to have a talk about this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why did I even mention this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This was your idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am sweating my balls off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How cold is it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's not cold at all! You only live once! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Come on, Khloe, that is your motto! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: YOLO! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You guys are so lame! It's so fun! Just do it! Just do it! You... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, Kourtney, Kourtney! Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? Hold hands. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and I, we made this YOLO pact. I don't know why I did anymore, because this is so scary. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Go! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Come on! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: One! Two! Come on. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Go, Khloe! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Three! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah! Go, Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Going alone is so much scarier. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Go, Khloe! One! Two! Three! 581 00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:26,712 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am so glad that we stuck to our YOLO pact, because it's so fun to do stuff that we wouldn't do every day. And that's why we're here on vacation. That's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That was so cool! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've never seen Bruce let Mom drive. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Her hair. Oh, my God, her wig. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She got so close... Did it fall off? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's right there in the water. Do you see it? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, God works in mysterious ways, 'cause that wig did not do her any justice. This is a sign. A sign from above. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Forget it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Grab it, grab it, 598 00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:21,066 grab it, grab it, grab it. Ew, it's like a drowned rat. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's to, uh, another good day in Greece, everybody. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Another tough day we survived. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you guys love that Mom's wig flew into the ocean? 'Cause now we could just rejoice in her short hair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys just don't get it. Sometimes you just got to do what you feel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're just so much prettier without it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: She does have a point. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, thanks, Khloe. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Here's salmon with vegetables. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's getting a little bit cold right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, we cuddle. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm getting jealous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, Brody, you can cuddle, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't worry, you have Kris to cuddle with. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's right. You have me, Brody. Lucky you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: My brother always kind of knows the right thing to say, but I'm definitely the more blunt. And I just want this trip to be fun, and I'm not trying to bring up any conflict. So I'm just gonna try to keep it mellow. &gt;&gt; LEAH: We're here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a bar. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Whoa, this is awesome! &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's pretty cool, huh? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Are we sitting inside or outside? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Just do inside. They have a Passion Fruit Viagra. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Is that true? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, there we go. Sneak Brandon one. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, right? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Please, do. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Brandon, yeah, Brandon, yeah. You need one of those. You need a little passion. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Don't be so excited, right? 'Cause then that'd make it seem like I... have to have a little, Leah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: That's the last thing he needs. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WAITER: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Thank you. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Ooh, thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Cheers. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Cheers. To a great vacation. &gt;&gt; LEAH: To Mykonos. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To Mykonos. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Thank you very much for everything, Dad. &gt;&gt; LEAH: To Mykonos. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I wonder which way the men's room is. It looks like it's downstairs. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't know. Now that he's gone... So, uh, it got a little awkward on the boat. &gt;&gt; LEAH: What happened? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Nothing happened, but... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm... I'm chilling on the top deck, laying out. Kris comes over and she's like, "Brody, want me to oil you up?" And I'm like, "Uh, okay." So I just chilled, and she started oiling me up. The rest of the girls were sort of making fun, and Khloe started saying something like, "Mom, you want to bang Br..." It just started being really awkward. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; BRODY: But then she threw out, like, uh... "Your back is just like Bruce's, back in the day." &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, no! No! Oh, my God, no! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's kind of a weird thing to say. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's a little strange. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Why do you think that happened? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I think that she doesn't think I like her. Over the years, growing up, I thought that Kris was the reason that I didn't see my father, and kind of painted her like a villain. I honestly think it's because she just doesn't know how to act around me. Or she's trying to be nice, but it was kind of an awkward way to be nice, you know? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's a little weird. &gt;&gt; LEAH: That was kind of strange. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is what's great about having Brandon and Brody on the trip with me, 'cause we get to do these fun things. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What about the putting green you didn't get? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ah, she'd probably kick me out of the house. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Got to fight these battles. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You got to fight them a little bit. It is tough to watch my dad get overruled, but he's just a very easygoing guy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It bothers him more than he admits. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is there enough wind for the kite? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bruce. &gt;&gt; ALEXANDRE: Hello. Hello, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRODY: How you doing? Brody. &gt;&gt; ALEXANDRE: Nice to meet you. How are you? Welcome, welcome. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are we crazy? Too much wind, or what? &gt;&gt; ALEXANDRE: No, it's perfect wind. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I grew up watching Bruce do all types of crazy sporting events. This guy was championship water-skier, race car driver. He was a very, very active person, so Brandon and I wanted to take him out, wanted to go kite-boarding. We got to get him out there. Let's go. Let's do this. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Sounds like a hurricane out there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Jesus. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's an impact vest. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are we going to war, or are we going into the water? That's the question. 702 00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,875 I don't think it's blowing enough. See, this is what's great about having Brandon and Brody on the trip with me, 'cause we get to do these fun things, like kite-surfing. Except I don't really know, at my age, if I should be taking up new things like kite-surfing. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: This is hilarious. My dad looks terrible. I think he's now realizing what he signed on for. 711 00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,953 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've had enough. Let's go! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So how are things with Brody? I just sense awkwardness. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is exactly what I told you before, that I feel like he doesn't get my personality. I don't like it when I feel like somebody doesn't get me or doesn't like me. I planned this trip so that we could all spend time together... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and maybe do a little bonding. And so when you do something like that and you put everybody together, and then you feel like somebody's totally taking you the wrong way... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe you just need to watch what you're saying more, because... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want to watch what I'm saying in front of my own family. It's my personality, and it's just the way I am. Those kinds of things have always come out of my mouth. Sometimes I feel like because I don't have a filter... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...you know, makes me who I am. But he's judging me, and I don't even know how to act or what to say around him. And I want to... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's probably judging you harder than he would judge another person because of our history. I know that my mom has struggled to find a relationship with Brody since the day that she met Bruce, but I feel like whatever's happened in the past, like, they just both need to make a decision to either make things work, or they don't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just be honest, and let's see what happens. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would just say-say something, though. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't just let it go, 'cause that's how we're here in the first place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I can't let that go; I can't let it go. 746 00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:17,549 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to say something. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One beer and a beautiful view. Life's good, right? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Good way to loosen you up, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; BRODY: So you got a place in Malibu. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I lasted there about... not even the first week. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, hold on. So you're back? Why did you do that in the first place? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 'Cause she wanted me to. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Why don't you have your own little space in your house? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, that's her house. She's already told me I've... I have no rights to anything inside that house. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What are you talking about? You live there. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't understand that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But I don't have any problem with that. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What about the putting green you didn't get? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The putting green-- okay, the putting green bothers me a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRODY: There you go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, okay, you-you hit a soft spot. When we moved into the house, in the backyard, we had a perfect place for a putting green. But it just didn't seem to pass with Kris, so... no putting green. I lost out on that deal. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why can't you put one in now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ah, she'd probably kick me out of the house. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You got to fight these battles. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You got to fight them a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's very easy for you to say. Sometimes it's kind of difficult to talk to Brandon and Brody about Kris's and my relationship because they may not understand it. The reason Kris and I have been married so long, I know the formula. You know, to be kind of quiet and, you know, when you have to speak up. I'm gonna go take a shower, clean up and get ready for dinner; let's do it. Look at that sun, it's going down; is that gorgeous? Look at that view. &gt;&gt; BRODY: All right, we'll see you at dinner. You see that? You see that? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I know, he got really weird... &gt;&gt; BRODY: He gets uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It bothers him more than he admits. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It is tough to watch my dad get overruled, but he's just a very easygoing guy. And I think that any relationship should be give and take, so if he wants a putting green, you know, at the house, he should be able to have that. We should get him a putting green. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Honestly, Kris would kill us. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Can I tell you what's my serious problem? I've bit my tongue for long enough. I'm gonna be totally, brutally honest with you. I think it's time for Kris and I to actually have that talk that we've always needed to have. &gt;&gt; MAN: He's so fat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, today's my last day in London, and I want to take advantage of the day and spend as much time as I can with my friends. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: I'm sitting poolside. &gt;&gt; BOTH: Poolside. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Especially before I embark on the family dreaded trip. Here. So, I figured what better way to spend the day with your boys than hit the steam rooms and saunas. It's like a Backstreet Boy video. Oh, yeah, baby. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: This is a nice view, isn't it? &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's insane. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at how weird that is that, like, the baby's, like, on that side. See? &gt;&gt; BRODY: God, that's so crazy to think about that, having a baby. When does the Lord get here, Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's meeting us in Santorini. Scott decided that it would be the smartest decision to stay in London while we were in Mykonos and just meet us in Santorini. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like an alien inside of you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That's literally what Aliens. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Does it feel like that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Everyone has their stuff, and I feel like that's one of our issues that we're just trying to deal with and make okay and make work for us. It doesn't make me happy that he'd rather be in London than be here, but, you know, it is what it is. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I feel like I've been here for, like, a month. I feel like I've been here for so long. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is cool. &gt;&gt; MAN: You ready to go? DreamCatcher. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get off the boat, we need a corkscrew. It's an emergency; we don't have a wine opener. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, &gt;&gt; LEAH: My top is going! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm doing a full-on photo shoot of myself. It's a little cray cray. I spent so much time on this vacation trying to connect with Brody and make a difference. And no matter what I do or what I say, I feel like it's just kind of falling on deaf ears. Brody, can I ask you a question? I kind of think that... ...I worry about, like, how you feel about me now as a mom, that like... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I have a serious issue and I'll tell you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know you do, and I feel it, like, I feel that, like, I can't change what happened between you and me years ago. &gt;&gt; BRODY: But it's not about that, it's not about that. Can I tell you what's my serious problem? I bit my tongue for long enough. I'm gonna be totally, brutally honest with you. I think it's time for Kris and I to actually have that talk that we've always needed to have. Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; KRIS: I kind of think that... ...I worry about, like, how you feel about me now as a mom, that like... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I have a serious issue and I'll tell you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know you do, and I feel it, like, I feel that, like, I can't change what happened between you and me years ago. &gt;&gt; BRODY: But it's not that, it's not about that. Can I tell you what's my serious problem? I bit my tongue for long enough. I'm gonna be totally, brutally honest with you. I think it's time for Kris and I to actually have that talk that we've always needed to have. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know that you love the lavish lifestyle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, definitely a bit of a diva. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay, exactly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not gonna deny. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You can't. You need to look at yourself and be like, "Are these things really what's important in life?" Like this, I don't give a about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, but this is how we came to this. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You're right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's it. But that's what I want you to know at the end of the day. &gt;&gt; BRODY: And I know, but I know-- no, no, but I do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not about the stuff. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know, I know, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's about all of you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: But really though? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, really, for real. When you were really young, I always thought, "I wish he liked me. If he knew me, like, he would love me." 'Cause I felt like you didn't know me. You didn't know all these different, um, layers of me... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I heard things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...or sides of me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, I heard things. What makes you genuinely happy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Having you genuinely happy. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, that's-that's a lie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Swear to God, it's not. &gt;&gt; BRODY: For me or them? &gt;&gt; KRIS: All of you. No, you, all of you. That is, as a mom or a stepmother, the most satisfying place you could live in in your entire life. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No because-because... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honest... but that's how I've always felt. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are we being honest? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Swear to God. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't feel like you've ever given two about the way Brandon and I have grown up. When she said I don't know her-- absolutely. I-I don't really know her that well. If she felt that she was never really able to express herself to me, she should've made more of an effort to reach out to me to have those type of conversations. Brandon and I are not Kendall, Kylie, Kourtney or Kim. We're not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, but you don't understand. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, no. Hear me out. Those are your babies. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is one of the most hurtful attacks I think that has ever been thrown my way. I have tried so hard for so many years. I just don't understand how we got here. 906 00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:10,855 And I feel so defeated. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sorry. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... Oh, my God, I don't like it, I don't like it! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Relax. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where did everybody go? &gt;&gt; BRODY: They're up early. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I haven't been included in one thing for this entire day. I might as well not be on this trip. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Go away! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to talk to you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm not doing this! &gt;&gt; KRIS: When I met Bruce, your parents had been separated. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, but where are we going with this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It wasn't like I was breaking up a marriage... &gt;&gt; BRODY: You need to look at yourself.
