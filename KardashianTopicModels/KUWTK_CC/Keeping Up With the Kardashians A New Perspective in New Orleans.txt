- &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you have to have surgery? Oh, my gosh. Reggie, his knee, he got an MRI, and he's out for the whole season. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you still get paid? That means you can't have the wild sex you guys normally do. &gt;&gt; KIM: You should have heard what Khloe said. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll tell him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hold on, hold on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Regina... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hold on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I said you guys can't have the wild sex you normally do, like on the washing machines. You guys... That means Kim could only... &gt;&gt; KIM: Shut up! Give me the phone! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hear all the stories about... &gt;&gt; KIM: Give me the phone! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...about your sex-capades. &gt;&gt; KIM: Give me the phone! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everywhere. &gt;&gt; KIM: Give me the phone! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: On the washing machines, in the cars. &gt;&gt; KIM: Give me the phone! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where you picked her up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Give me the phone! : Khloe, stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And it was wild and crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hang up the phone, baby! If you love me, you'll hang up! All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Enough! &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; Khloe, you want to twist a little? Can you come in, like, a couple of inches? Thank you. All right, you guys ready? ♫ ♫ All right, we're good. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, this photo shoot for <i>OK!</i> magazine is so exciting. We're in these gowns and these jewels, and our hair is done all glamorous, and the girls and I are just having the best time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're stunning. You make me sick how stunning you are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, you guys, Reggie is doing this celebrity charity pool tournament in New Orleans this weekend and wants us all to play in the tournament. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, that'd be so fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: And, oh, my God, Khloe, you're gonna die. Paul Wall is gonna be there, Shaq, Vivica Fox. So many different people are coming. New Orleans is such an amazing city. They have, like, the best food, the best shopping. And I'm really excited to be able to bring my family there and show them around. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so excited, and I need to, like, wear this outfit. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have to go to New Orleans dressed just like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I think of New Orleans, I think of Bourbon Street, Mardi Gras, and listening to jazz. I am so excited to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: New Orleans, here we come, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How's it going down there in New Orleans? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, amazing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, good. Not that I don't love you girls-- you girls are out of town. I got Kendal and Kylie on a school trip. I got the house all to myself. I'm trying to have a romantic night with Mom, okay? Only a couple of days a year, do I... get the house to just Kris and I. So this is what I did. : Tell me if you guys approve, okay? I got roses. I got a chef coming to cook. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who knew you had these skills? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, I have tremendous skills. You know, it's time for a romantic, erotic... few days with my wife. What do you think, is there anything I'm missing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think you're good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'm gonna get her nude and chase her around the house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good job! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Run that marathon, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good luck! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, thanks. Have a good time down there. All right! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. Smooch. CiCi?! Hi. What are you doing? You're on your way here? Oh, my God, yeah, we <i>are</i> home. My cousin CiCi is coming into town, and I am <i>so</i> excited to see her. I'll have you all to myself. I'm so excited. I don't get the opportunity to see her very much, because she moved away to Houston. Okay, bye. So her coming into town is really, really special. Hey, honey, it's me. I just called to tell you that I got a call from CiCi and she's gonna come spend the weekend with us. I'm excited! All right, love you. Call me. Bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: So, we get to Reggie's party, and... there has just been so much work put into this event. &gt;&gt; Explain what's gonna happen tonight. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Well, this is a celebrity pool tournament that we plan to hopefully raise a lot of money for the community, to give back to charity. &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie pulled an amazing crowd together-- everyone from Shaquille O'Neal and Vivica Fox and Paul Wall, Terrell Owens, and even the Black Widow, Jeanette Lee. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Tonight we get together, trying to rebuild the city that we all love. Please give a hand for Reggie Bush. Give it up for him, y'all, for putting this together to raise the money for New Orleans. Ladies and gentlemen, let the pool begin. Deejay, kick it out, man. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Reggie's party is definitely a success. We're having such a great time. It's always nice to be partying together. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: All these jerseys come in one pack. We're starting the bidding off at $10,000. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: $10,000. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Ten autographed jerseys. Do we have $10,000? &gt;&gt; KIM: All the proceeds that they raise for this charity go to Reggie's 619 Foundation, which raises money for all the people in New Orleans that have been hit hard by Katrina. You did such a good job. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! The chef is here! All right, tonight's the night. The kids are off on a school trip, the girls are down in New Orleans, I don't have to worry about being interrupted at all. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You made it. Good to see you, Randy. Come on in. : It's been so long since we've had a few days by ourselves, it's kind of tough-- okay, how do I do this? But I got to bring back my memory here and set the atmosphere for, you know... a great night. And remember... when we're done with dinner... get out of the house! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The famous Cafe du Monde! After Reggie's pool tournament, the next day I'm hung over, I'm tired, I just want to go get some beignets that we've heard so much about, and we just want to soak in the life of New Orleans. Do you eat it with your hand? Last night was so amazing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was the coolest thing, that all those people... Like, Reggie has to feel so good about himself, that he accomplished, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All these people came to support... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! Totally. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, this girl comes up to us and asks for a picture with us, and we're so flattered, and, you know, she tells us she's from New Orleans, and we meet her entire family, and they are so sweet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. I'm Kim. &gt;&gt; Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your daughter is so sweet. &gt;&gt; Oh, I think so. This is my princess. Well, thank you. You're in town visiting? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. We've-we've never been here before. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, this is our first time here. We love it. &gt;&gt; You guys have to, like, go to the French Quarter, travel around. Um, visit the Ninth Ward definitely and New Orleans East as well. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is the Ninth Ward, like, the worst? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's badly damaged still. Their houses are gone. &gt;&gt; It's almost as if time stood still. And it's almost three years later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did it affect you? &gt;&gt; Oh, we left two days before the storm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And as we keep talking to them, we find out they're actually not... doing that great. They've been living in a FEMA trailer for two and a half years. &gt;&gt; I think it's important that you see it, and it'll give you a better sense of exactly what New Orleans is about right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You should be our tour guide. &gt;&gt; I'd love to be you guys's tour guide. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you mind if you guys do that? &gt;&gt; No, I really don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I personally would love it if she... You'll be our tour guide? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, it's me. I just called to tell you that I got a call from CiCi. She's going to come spend the weekend with us. I'm excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am... devastated. It seems like every time I try to plan something, something goes on. There goes my weekend. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's so much history in this town. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, every place here is like, unique. L.A. everything like, looks the same and it's like a mold. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we're driving around in New Orleans and it's just really different for us and really interesting to see things that we've never seen before. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that true that the X's on the doors and the numbers is how many people that died? &gt;&gt; MARISSA: Mm-hmm. It's like how many people died or like, if anybody was found. &gt;&gt; ROB: The houses are just crumbled into pieces. It's literally just blocks and blocks and blocks of just trash. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at that house, you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. I want to go inside one. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we get to the Ninth Ward and it looks like... it looks like it did the day Katrina hit. &gt;&gt; It took over two weeks for someone to get here. You know, we had no electricity. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a complete ghost town. Not a soul lives there. All of the homes, if they haven't been completely destroyed, look like old haunted houses. Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. Look at the ceiling-- how it fully just flew down. &gt;&gt; MARISSA: This is similar to what ours looked like. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just really hard to believe that this is someone's home, and these are someone's personal belongings that are just blown all over the floor. &gt;&gt; LISA: I was told our house-- we only had a few shingles missing. But when we first got out of the cars, and got to the house, unlocked the door, the door wouldn't open. And when we finally forced the door open, the ceiling had caved in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is your roof fixed? &gt;&gt; LISA: My roof is fixed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; LISA: And before the roof was fixed, every time it rained, it rained in my house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; LISA: I would say about 80-90% of everything we had, we lost. Furnishings, clothing, pictures, everything. Everything. It took three 40-cubic-yard dumpsters to pretty much haul 20 years of us away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They lost everything. Now they are living in a FEMA trailer which is on the other side of their home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So your trailer is just right out front? &gt;&gt; LISA: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's almost like torture. You see your home, but you can't go in it, because there's nothing there. &gt;&gt; KIM: The whole trailer is... as big as probably my bedroom. &gt;&gt; LISA: Okay, look around. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. So how long have you guys lived in here? &gt;&gt; LISA: Next month, it'll be two years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. &gt;&gt; LISA: Two years. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's so odd that people aren't trying to like, help. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The whole day that we've been with this family, they have not once complained, not once did a "Woe is me," or a "We want help." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, come here for one sec. Rob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We really, really want to do something for them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's like, you know, a single mom with these three kids. &gt;&gt; ROB: We should help them get a lot of stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll put in money. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll put in... I mean, we'll all put in money. But I think you should call... Maybe Reggie has a contact from the charity. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I'll definitely make some calls. So I call Reggie, and I see if he has any connections through his charity. Hi, this is Kim Kardashian. I got your number from Reggie Bush. I'm working with a family out here in New Orleans and I wanted to see... You know, he's told me that you guys have worked with his foundation before. And I just wanted to know if there was anything that you can do to help us out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All right, guys. Here's our surprise. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, this is Kim Kardashian. I got your number from Reggie Bush. I'm working with a family out here in New Orleans. And I just wanted to know if there is anything you can do to help us out. Really? Okay, great. We'll come by today. This is so exciting. We now have, like, the greatest surprise for this family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We want to go to one more place. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh. Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So are you guys ready? &gt;&gt; MARISSA: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so let's go on a road trip. &gt;&gt; Oh, road trip. &gt;&gt; MARISSA: Saddle up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So here we are. &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, my God, look how nice the house looks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; CICI: Wow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just put your stuff there. &gt;&gt; CICI: Okay. Hi, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, hi, CiCi. Aw, man. There's no way to fight this one. Oh, well. Looks like table setting for three. &gt;&gt; CICI: Let's toast. We need to toast to Bruce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, thank you so much. &gt;&gt; CICI: This is so nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What a great dinner. &gt;&gt; CICI: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so glad you came to spend some time with us. &gt;&gt; CICI: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm excited. &gt;&gt; CICI: Thank you for having me. I need to go to the store, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, you've got to check Dash out. &gt;&gt; CICI: I have to see everything that they have for the new season. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to get your advice on stuff, because we've got the new Dylan's Candy Bar stuff in from New York. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: As usual, I'm being left out of dinner. CiCi, Kris, are just talking, talking, talking away. And nobody seems to be talking to me, even though I did everything-- that's kinda my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everyone keeps saying "When's Kim getting married? When's Kourtney getting married?" And Robert is going to be the first one that gets married. &gt;&gt; CICI: Yes, definitely. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Excuse me. Uh, I'm going to go to the bedroom. You girls enjoy. &gt;&gt; CICI: Thank you again, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll get this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually Randy will... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Randy's going to get it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks for having Randy here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You are quite welcome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's so much fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, guys. Here's our surprise. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we take her to the furniture store, and the look on her face is priceless. So Universal Furniture and us are, you know, kind of putting a little bit together and we're donating furniture. So you can pick out whatever you want and they'll hold it for you as long as you want until, you know, your home is ready. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are so welcome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just really nice that we all got to get together and help them. &gt;&gt; I like this. This is cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: This one is so cool. &gt;&gt; LISA: This is... Ooh! It's nice and sturdy. &gt;&gt; Whoo! &gt;&gt; LISA: I mean, really, this is... &gt;&gt; ...a dream come true. &gt;&gt; LISA: Just, I can't believe how amazing it is. It's got to be one of the best days we've had. And thank you, thank you, thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Being around you guys, I know it's only been a couple hours, but it's really just amazing, your outlook. Oh, Kourtney, I'm so happy! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Oh, my God. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How's your night going? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm sitting here by myself watching television. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, Khlo, it didn't work out quite the way I wanted it to. I'm ready to run around the house, chasing my naked wife, and, uh, guess who shows up. CiCi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I'm sorry, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. I tried. But Khloe, I gave it the effort. That's the most important thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, look how pretty. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, this is so lovely. Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; LISA: I just have to tell you all, we've been just so richly blessed. I mean, God does everything in His own time, in His own way, and He used you three lovely ladies and your brother to give us a really incredible gift. &gt;&gt; KIM: It also puts things in perspective, I think, for us, because we live in L.A. and I think that it is a big wakeup call for us. We're having the best time at dinner, and I'm really anxious because we have one more surprise for this family. Hi. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, you know, all that stuff yesterday, I had, like, the whole house to myself. So I'm planning this whole romantic night. &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really anxious because we have one more surprise for this family. Hi. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; MARISSA: I'm starstruck. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Reggie comes in to dinner, and Marissa's face is shocking. She's, like... like she can't breathe. &gt;&gt; MARISSA: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you like it? &gt;&gt; LISA: Thank you, Mr. Bush. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: No problem. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here you go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Finally, a smile. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: You been to any Saints' games? &gt;&gt; MARISSA: No. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: You ever been to one? All right, we'll get you to some games. &gt;&gt; MARISSA: Oh, my goodness. Thank you. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: You guys want to go, too? &gt;&gt; Mm-hmm. Oh, my goodness. I'm almost like my daughter. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cic! How are you doing this morning? &gt;&gt; CICI: Good morning. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. Did you have a good night? &gt;&gt; CICI: I had a great night. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; CICI: Thank you so much for having me. It's so good to see you guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's time to break the news to CiCi, uh, what my intentions were and what happened. Uh, you know, all that stuff yesterday, actually, what happened, you know, with the kids in New Orleans, the two little ones up on a school trip... I had, like, the whole house to myself, so I'm planning this whole romantic night. &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes. You know, what are you gonna do? &gt;&gt; CICI: I'm so sorry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, well, it's all right. &gt;&gt; CICI: Kris, I need to talk to you about something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? What's wrong? &gt;&gt; CICI: Well, Bruce just came to me, and you know yesterday? He was really upset. He had planned this romantic dinner... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; CICI: ...and now I ruined this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I told him you were coming. &gt;&gt; CICI: I feel so bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel so bad when I realized that Bruce really did have this wonderful romantic weekend planned for us. &gt;&gt; CICI: Let's think about Bruce now. I'm gonna take care of the little girls, you guys are going away for the weekend. He deserves it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, he does. &gt;&gt; CICI: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I deserve it! I deserve it! &gt;&gt; CICI: He deserves it. All right, I've gotta go to the grocery store. I'll see you later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Bye, honey. Thank you. Oh, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you hear how CiCi ruined Bruce and Mom's boning fiesta? They were having a sex-capade, and CiCi crashed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We come home from New Orleans, and we find CiCi at the house. Looks like this romantic weekend definitely went south. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Since I didn't go, girls, how was New Orleans? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, one of my favorite cities. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: While we were in New Orleans, we learned so much and we took so much home with us. &gt;&gt; KIM: When you meet people that are so happy to be alive, and they're not complaining that they're in this trailer and have been living in a FEMA trailer for almost three years. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A family of, like, four. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; CICI: Did you, like... Were you so grateful for what you have? &gt;&gt; KIM: It just puts everything in perspective, and it makes you realize that we're so blessed and so lucky to have what we have. Being in New Orleans and experiencing what we went through and meeting this family has really helped my whole family remember that we have good times, bad times. We've been through so many ups and downs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I pick you up and throw you down! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, no, no! No! No! No! &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Take these little things and maybe throw them away. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't do that, Mom! You're sitting there laughing! It's not funny! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not laughing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dad would never let any of this happen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I love you. Love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: At the end of the day, no matter where we are, what we're going through, we'll always have each other. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We are off to Santa Barbara. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, you guys. Tell CiCi thanks for watching the little kids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Theowes you one, baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kris wants to get a little <i>sausage</i> tonight.
