- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... Scott is being so selfish right now. And the fact that Kourt's so far along and pregnant, it's just not okay to do to someone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The doctor said the baby's coming early. Don't know if I could even rely on you to be there. Maybe I just need to wrap my head around the idea that he isn't going to be here. I can't deal with the stress. Our new baby boy, Reign Aston Disick, was born on December 14, and we feel so blessed and so excited to welcome him into our family. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How'd you get up here like this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have a new brother? Come here! Give me a hug. Up! Ooh, I like this dance. Kourtney has been hibernating ever since she gave birth to baby Reign, and I cannot wait to see him. He's so cute and chubby and I just want to see him. Lord, how's life as having, like, a five-person household? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No difference. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, people keep, like, just writing me e-mails and calling me and congratulating me like this is my first child. And yeah, it's nice, but I know what it's like to have kids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Normally, that's, like, a nice thing to do... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I don't want to be bothered. 'Cause then I have to write them back, which is annoying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott is now telling me what an inconvenience it is to write back to people who are congratulating him. I know he's been going through a really tough time, but this is definitely not the way to handle the situation. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You think I want to take the time to write you back "thank you"? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye and I tried to move a couch last night. Us, together, we could not even lift it one inch off the ground. We were like, what is going on? Isn't it weird when you had your own place, like, by yourself, the strength you have to move furniture when no one's around? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, for sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, I feel like I finally have my own space. Unpacking all these boxes and seeing stuff I haven't seen in a year and a half makes me so happy. How did I survive in Mom's guest room downstairs with me, Kanye and the baby... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...for a year and a half? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'd never move back home, ever. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just... I don't know why we didn't rent a house. Like, half the year was like a nightmare. Those last six months was really hard. We finally moved into our new home, and it is so exciting. We have been living in a one-bedroom room at my mom's house, sharing this tiny closet, and so it feels really good just to have our own home. I am so happy with the house. It's just, I don't want anyone to see it until... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fully decorated. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, fully decorated. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's how I felt about here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want, like, a perfect house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert threw a party here last night. Major whores. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew, really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Someone threw up in my house. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? Like, he won't leave the house or see us, hardly, but he'll have parties and see other people? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yep. &gt;&gt; KIM: His life is so bizarre. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, I really want to put an offer on this house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, but let's just figure out how much work needs to be done first, because you're the one who said you want this to be a good investment. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This would have to be painted, you know, white. Everything white. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Right. Whole house painted, done. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because it's yellow. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I like this color better than white. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. We'll pick a color. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Cool. I have found the perfect house, and I think you just know, when you're buying a house, when you go into it, if it's the one or not, and I just felt like this one was really the one. Wait, so what were you thinking about in here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This floor stays wood and everything painted white and change the door handles. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And suddenly, you have a kick-ass, gorgeous office. 'Cause this'll be like-- Haven't you seen those homes in, Architectural Digest when everything is white and then the dark wood floor? Like, you could do that gray fur carpet in here. I just found out a couple weeks ago that Kylie really wants to move out, ASAP. &gt;&gt; SALESWOMAN: Are you gonna have a new place pretty soon? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. I think I'm gonna start looking, like, this week. &gt;&gt; SALESWOMAN: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So the second I turn 18, I'll be all moved in and ready to live in my house. &gt;&gt; SALESWOMAN: Wow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie reminded me that she has a lot of projects she's been working on and she really wants to take that money and invest in some real estate. I think sometimes Kylie is really underestimated, because she's really a bright kid, and I just want to be here for Kylie every step of the way. My suggestion was she does a... like, a pole here and then maybe... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Curtain? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...curtains. Put them back like that, so, like, two hooks here and so you see this cute little room and there's just shelf after shelf, and this is accessories. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Purses and... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So... like a little store. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Very cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We are so smart. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think so, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I'm done. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Oh...a duck, bro. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? You just had a baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Everybody's mad at me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um... So, Lord, what is your plan for the day? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why? Y'all trying to go clubbing? &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Um, I need to remind you that it is 11:00 a.m., not p.m. No clubs are open. But I do suggest, like, a shower. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll go home right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not allowed there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Huh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott has, apparently, had a wild night last night and Kourtney has made it very clear that he is not allowed to go home when he is... like this. He was very wild last night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's ridiculous. This is what happened last time. It's like, I've set this ban here, and he just can't come here in this state. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I 100% want to respect Kourt's wishes, but I also don't know what to do with Scott. She wants to call the police on you. She wanted me to call the police on you, so... unless you want that to happen... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She said that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, plenty of times. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She said I couldn't go home? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, yeah, you can't. Yeah, she will have you arrested if you go home. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'm gonna go home. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nope, nope. Nope, nope, nope. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'm gonna go home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nope. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: No, you're not. If you take a shower, have a nap, have some food, maybe you could go home. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't go there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you sober up, you're allowed to go there. Until then, you got to chill. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you chasing the high for? Like, where are we going? This is, like, a boring day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's a good point. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not like anyone else is raging with you. There's not a party going on. Isn't it boring? Why don't we simmer down... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...and chill? Scott, in this condition, is not easy to handle. I think I have a lot of patience for people, especially in these situations, and this is a hard one. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is he getting up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: I hope not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm with Khadijah, here on speaker. We finally both wrangled him into his room. He's just not really slowing down, but... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE and KHADIJAH: Scott's here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sure he is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought you were gonna lay down, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can I come home? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're not allowed to come here in that state of mind. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you, and by the way, I know I've made you sick. I know I've made you... &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Can you just... can we go... can you go to bed? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, I just don't think any of this is, like, going anywhere positive. Give me the phone. Stay here. This is what he does when he comes home? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I'm doing it. I'm going home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you're not. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: No, you're not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: She doesn't want you to come home. You're not gonna... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She don't want me to come home? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up! You, shut up. Kourt, I got to call you back. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Can we sit and talk for a second? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott is determined to walk to his house. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At this point, I feel like there's nothing else I can do. He is on a mission, and there's really no stopping him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't give a about all of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know what else to do. Where you going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Myhouse. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't need this &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott. All right, I'm calling Kourtney. Kylie has been looking at houses, and I think she found one in Calabasas. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What is there to do in Calabasas? What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's gone again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kourt, like, kick him out of the house or what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott has been MIA, and it's been a few days now. Kourtney never knew he left. He left without telling her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, there you are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just so tired. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm stealing a cookie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course, that's what they're there for. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When I was talking to you the other day, you sounded down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The other day, we were on the phone and we're talking, and you just didn't... You know, "I'm working so hard." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It wasn't... had anything to do with me. Scott went, like, ballistic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why was he going ballistic? He's got the life of Riley. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The life of who? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's kind of a-a saying, "the life of Riley." It's like you're living this great life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't we change it to the life of Scott? 'Cause Scott has... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kind of does anything he wants to do, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. I was babysitting Scott because the whole night he was drinking alcohol. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I thought he stopped drinking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Every day it's different. At 6:00 a.m., a security guard brought Scott here 'cause Kourtney doesn't let him go to their house when he's, like, crazy. It was just such a draining experience. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kourt, like, kick him out of the house or what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He ended up around, like, 3:00 in the afternoon leaving here. He's gone again. Ever since Scott left my house, he's been MIA, and it's been a few days now. Kourtney never knew he left. He left without telling her. Everyone's worried about you, and the only person that you're worried about is yourself. It's pretty sad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not okay. It's not okay. If you're gonna do stupid like that, I'm not letting you in the house. You sleep outside on the front lawn. You can't be doing that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can I get the chicken wrap, please? Can I get a blueberry muffin, too? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't do that to me, Kendall. I'm not allowed to eat a blueberry muffin. Can I get pulled chicken with a side of veggies? &gt;&gt; SERVER: Yeah, sure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would love that. Thank you so much. So you're leaving tomorrow for Paris. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, I leave on Friday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, you leave on Friday for Paris. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: They're blueberry, right? &gt;&gt; SERVER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is it good? Shut theup. So, you know Kylie has been looking at houses, and I think she found one in Calabasas. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's too much work. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What is there to do in Calabasas? What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, I live there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And you get, like, a nice, big house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, but I wish I had a condo-- but if I was younger, I never would. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Exactly, exactly. I was about to do the same thing, ended up moving out here. So much more to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So much more. You guys have a social life. If you live in Calabasas, you would never. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Exactly, exactly. I think Kylie getting her first house is amazing, and I think she's just really excited to be able to have her own house and live on her own, but there's just a lot that goes into it. That was, like, the thing that surprised me when I bought my house, and I hope she understands. It's a lot of work. Yum. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. This is too good. It can't be, like, healthy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's all protein. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's only five grams of protein. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I ate perfect in New York; you would've been so proud of me. Hello? Hi. &gt;&gt; GRUTMAN: Hello? Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm with Khloe right now. &gt;&gt; GRUTMAN: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, gorg. &gt;&gt; GRUTMAN: So, I told him I was coming here; he said he was coming here, and it's been four days now, right? This is not one of those situations where, "Oh,, I gotup, and then I, uh, I sobered up, and I realized I gotup, and okay, I'm cool now for a week." You know what I mean? He needs help, he needs help. &gt;&gt; KIM: None of us have really heard from Scott up until I get a call from one of our mutual friends saying that Scott is in Aspen. You know, I always give Scott the benefit of the doubt, but in this case, I think Scott's just way out of line. I don't even know what to do. &gt;&gt; GRUTMAN: The good news is that they are gonna get a plane now, within the next hour, and get him out of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, yeah, go talk to him and then call me. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; GRUTMAN: Okay, I'll call you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So he just, like, up and went to Aspen? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He ended up not even telling Kourtney he left. She just texts me. She goes, "I'm not sure what to do. He's flying home tonight from Aspen. He basically said he knows he can't be a good partner." Blah, blah, blah. So what do I say to her? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If it was me, I'd probably have him come home, stay in the bedroom downstairs until he gets it together and we can figure it out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott has had a really hard year, and I understand that it's different this time. Like, his parents aren't here. But as a man, he's got to grow up, and he's got to be there for his girlfriend. You're gonna shoot a video with Daddy. Kanye is shooting a video for his song, "Only One." Aw, look at how cute she looks. This is so exciting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is not what I wanted to be doing with my life, but everything has taken a turn. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have three of the most beautiful kids in the world. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Everything just doesn't feel good inside. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're going out. You're gonna shoot a video with Daddy. How fun. This is so exciting. Kanye is shooting a video for his song, "Only One." It's really a song that he realized is his mother singing through him to him, and Spike Jonze is shooting this video just on his iPhone. I think it's such a cool, like, concept, and I know it's gonna turn out so amazing. I wonder if she needs me over there. ♫ ♫ It's so crazy how she, like, loves to be outside. She, like, loves the rain, loves everything about outside. Aw, look at how cute she looks. I feel like I should hide. Like, if she sees me, she's gonna, like, run to me and slip in the mud. Let's hide behind the bush. It's so special to have North in a video with her dad. I'll peek out again. Ooh. And I think she looks so beautiful. ♫ ♫ I feel so blessed that we now have our little family. It's, like, so amazing that this is my life. Hi! Hey, cutie. You did so good in Daddy's video. Are you cleaning out? What are these from? Looks like you literally hand-made this. Khloe, this you don't need. Come on, come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agree with that. &gt;&gt; KIM: You need to have, like, cool sequiny things. This one looks cheap, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what you could do is go through my dresses, 'cause I agree I don't need all that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know that Kylie is going into escrow on her house? &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. She really got it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Well, in escrow. &gt;&gt; KIM: No way. She's just, like, so advanced in some areas, but it's like, to run a whole household? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You literally have to get, like, gardeners, you have to get a pool man. You have to pay, like, estate tax. I don't think she understands, like, we have to pay H.O.A. fees, like... I definitely had to learn what to expect when I got my first house, and I'm still learning. And Kylie's definitely gonna need a cheat sheet as to what goes into owning a house. I think Kim and I are the best ones to give it to her, 'cause Kim and I have definitely had to learn the hard way with some of our houses. I just think I need to teach Kylie how to do this stuff. Like, we all have to learn to prove to Mom that she can do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I mean, I'm down. I'll help her, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, I just need to make sure she even knows how to do her laundry. &gt;&gt; KIM: A mummy for Halloween? Do you want it for a mummy costume, seriously? You want it. This is just, like, horrendous. &gt;&gt; KIM: You got to get rid of these cookies, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't eat them! Like, you're mad 'cause you ate three today? That's yourproblem. Get some self-control. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't have it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, that's not my problem. I want decorativein my house. And want a guest wants cookies, they can... &gt;&gt; KIM: I wish I could buy self-control. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The rebel's back! The last time I saw you, why I ought to. He was at my house throwing liquor everywhere. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Scott just got back from this wild weekend in Aspen, and he looks better after sleep, and I realize that we need to help out in any way that we can. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So how was Aspen? &gt;&gt; KIM: I heard it was wild, from numerous people there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was a debacle. I mean, I went out to dinner with all these kids that randomly were there from New York. Like, all my Syrian friends were there, so I went out to Nobu the first night. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do they think you're just a lunatic? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Most people do, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do they, like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But it's getting to the point it's not that cute, so I'm like, I just want to calm down. Beautiful town though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you remember? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, first day. We should really go there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think they will have you back? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would just die if I were Kourt just for the fact, you have a little baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How did she act when you came home? Were you on punishment? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Super bizarre to me that she's even speaking to me, to be quite honest. I just think, at this point, she's just feeling bad for me and herself. I feel bad for everybody, too. Obviously, like, this is not what I wanted to be doing with my life, but everything's taken a turn. I mean... &gt;&gt; KIM: But you have such a good life. You have three of the most beautiful kids in the world. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I get it. Everything sounds perfect, you know? It just doesn't feel good inside. It's just hard, and it's a struggle, and... You know, obviously, I can't blame it on my parents forever. Either I need to make a life for myself or, you know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I used to get so upset with Scott. I used to hold everything over his head. Right now though I just want to help him and get him to a comfortable place. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I have a family and all these things. I can't just be like, "Oh, my parents died. That's sad. I hate my life." Like, you know, it's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It'shard though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Having a house is a huge responsibility. &gt;&gt; KIM: You need to think about earthquake insurance. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Flood insurance. &gt;&gt; KIM: Homeowner's association fees. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rattlesnake fencing. Do you know how to do your own laundry? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He thinks this is his destiny. Certain things run in his family... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's an excuse. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know what to do anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Damn, Gina, you looking fly and &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guess what I heard. &gt;&gt; KIM: Huh? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you guys know what freezing is? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's, like, a form of witchcraft, and I heard some people around us are doing it. You write down names, and you, like, put them in the freezer and you, like, freeze them. It's like doing voodoo to you, and it's, like, a form to, like, freeze them so they're stuck in a place of, like, torment because, like, whatever. I'm like, "Why would anybody do that?" Don'tfreeze me. I'll freeze you back. That's so rude. &gt;&gt; KIM: No voodoocan tear us down. That's what Michael Jackson used to always say. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really? Maybe I'm reincarnated Michael Jackson. Okay, Kylie, so you're moving into your house soon. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. Having a house is a huge responsibility. &gt;&gt; KIM: A huge responsibility that I don't even think that you realize. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know how to do your own laundry? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you know anything about credit? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Not really. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know how to iron? What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie. No, seriously? I cannot believe you don't know this. Here's things that you need to think about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. You need to take notes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Earthquake insurance. We live in California. That is a must. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Flood insurance, fire insurance, especially up here. There was a flood in my house. I came home, the whole thing was flooded. My pool table room. &gt;&gt; KIM: Homeowner's association fees. H.O.A. fees could be, like, 1,000 bucks a month. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you hang something, it has to be bolted down to the walls. You have to have them earthquake-proof. You have to have rattlesnake fencing for your house for your dogs. &gt;&gt; KIM: You need to have a really good gardener. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Set up electricity. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kim and Khloe have made me aware that it's a little tough to own a home, and I really hope I'm not in over my head. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here's a list. Mom's not gonna do all of this for you, so, you know, I think this is really important. Now, there's a lot more we can add, but I think it's really important that you start to do those things and realize the responsibilities of having a house. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I agree. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. How's everything going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know, same old situation, different day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? Are you good with Scott going to Pismo and everything? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, yeah. I think it's good for him to do, you know, positive things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Me, too. After talking with Scott, I think he definitely needs some family bonding behavior, so I've invited Scott to go drive dune buggies with Bruce and I in Pismo Beach. Why do you think he's acting the way he is? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Honestly, I don't know. You know, and I do feel bad, but I feel like a lot of it is, like, he thinks this is his destiny. Certain things run in his family... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's an excuse. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and I'm like, "You have so many blessings." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. Ever since Scott has returned home from his bender, he's been really depressed, and I feel so incredibly bad for Kourt because I know she loves her family, I know she loves Scott, and I think she's at such a loss as to what to do with him that she's willing to try anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like I don't know what to do anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why did you want to stay in Santa Barbara last night? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wouldn't you rather be, like, home? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, I definitely go in and out of happy and dark places in my life, so the last thing I want is to hear some big lectures. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I was talking to Khloe and Kim, and they were just making me second-guess the house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We need to put "Kardashian Beauty" on here. Who's paying you for this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, what are you doing, buddy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're leaving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am going to be on a wonderful road trip with Bruce. Scott was supposed to be a part of our long road trip, but he is driving up to Pismo Beach on his own because he did not want to be stuck in a car with Bruce for that many hours. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Isn't this exciting? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Totally. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're going to Pismo Beach, Khloe, and it's gonna take us two hours and 11 minutes of wonderful conversation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Aren't you excited? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How often do we get two hours and 11 minutes with nothing to do but talk? ♫ Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum. ♫ Tell me when you get done, so we can... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, you have two and a halfhours. Relax. Seriously. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ♫ We're getting closer. ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ♫ Yes, we are. ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're missing everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I've seen grass before. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at these trailer parks. A whole town went by. That you never even looked up and saw. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you missed it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm okay with that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not. You missed that chicken. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not okay with smelling this... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See that chicken back there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not okay with smelling this tuna. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at that chicken back there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, Bruce, this is getting ridiculous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was a huge chicken. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You smell like &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do you have a second to talk? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, but aren't I gonna see you in five minutes? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Um, well... I was talking to Khloe and Kim the other day or whatever, and, um, they were just telling me all this stuff that's making me second-guess the house. And making me feel like this is a very big deal. I don't know if I can handle it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, first of all, you can handle anything that you set your mind to. Let's start there. Second of all, every single one of your sisters has gone through this process, and it's been a great learning experience. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So I was really excited, but they're talking about money. All the work and all the stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your sisters are probably worried because you're so young and they didn't do it quite as young as you. You've gotten a major head start, especially financially. And they didn't have that same opportunity, so they were a little bit older. Maybe they're worried about that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that what you're doing is really responsible, really a good idea. Besides the fact that we're gonna have a ton of fun while we're doing it. Maybe you'll really love to do this and you'll start, you know, buying and selling homes. Who knows what it could lead to, you know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think one of the reasons that I want Kylie to buy this house so badly is because I feel like it's a really good investment, and it's something that she'll be so thankful for years from now. Just know that I'm here to protect you, sweetie, I'm not here to let you fail or make a bad decision, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I'll see you in a few minutes, okay? We're gonna have so much fun. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right, I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, Scott is meeting us there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, what's the deal with Scott? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. Why don't you talk to him? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you think I should say to him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would... It's not what you say, it's how you say it. I think I would just say it like, "Hey, I notice you've been not around as much at the house. Like, is something going on?" Say exactly what you said to me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's get something to eat and go ride! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here we are, the Madonna Inn. Let's go find the Lord. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scottie. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What a miraculous restaurant. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have you ever been in a car for almost two and a half hours with her? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've been in a house with her for two and a half years at a time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why did you want to stay in Santa Barbara last night? It's just a three-hour drive here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know, I just felt like once everybody went to sleep in the house, I would just get on the road, 'cause I like driving at night better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But why would you want to sleep alone and not with your... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't sleep with Kourtney anyway. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But why don't you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She sleeps with the baby, in the baby's room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So does Kourtney know you slipped out last night? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Instead of doing that, wouldn't you rather be, like, home? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think for a really long time I've struggled with going back and forth from drinking and not drinking and going out and partying and not partying. And I came up here hoping to kind of relax a little bit, take some time off. So the last thing I want is to hear some big lectures. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do it! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, Scott and I are renting dune buggies, and I think it's gonna be a lot of fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The other day when we were over at the house, we kept looking for you. And you were, like, gone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've always wanted to change, it's just not as simple as people think. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, we're getting into the play park here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, wow, cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll take it off and bring it over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; GUIDE: What we're gonna do is take this back path and head south down the beach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am actually so excited to be dune buggying. Scott and I are renting our dune buggies and, of course, Mr. Bruce Jenner has to bring his own custom dune buggy and show off. Think this is gonna be a lot of fun. &gt;&gt; GUIDE: Oh, there we go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at Bruiser, he's ready to go. &gt;&gt; GUIDE: Whenever you guys are ready, just fire it up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce has a roof on his. Scott, we need a roof on ours. &gt;&gt; GUIDE: Oh, there we go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do it! Buggies out in the desert are, like, so much fun to drive. You got to be careful, because you don't know what's on the other side of the hill, but it's amazing how quick they go. Anybody can drive them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's got, like, 20 horsepower. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Take mine for a quick ride. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll go with you. I don't mind. I don't need to drive. I'll just hang with you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you having fun, babe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mine doesn't go as fast as yours, but I tried. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, because you went all the way through, that's all you need. Good job. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to say, this is actually quite fun, and I kind of needed this. Definitely not gonna feel guilty about this tomorrow, and it's like a breath of fresh air. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was so fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it was... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wasn't that fun? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did pretty good for my first time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You were ballsy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, yeah, Khloe, you were going for it. I can't believe you did that big banker one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You just hit the throttle on that one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's as fast as it goes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, those things... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, how are you guys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa, "Come and take it." Stop. That's what their flag says. "Come and take it." Who is that person? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They're just rednecks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna hit up that chick I'm seeing. Hey, buggle. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just feeding Reign. Mase is sitting with me, and Penelope's helping Grace make soup. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me say hi to Marty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to come here and say hello? No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh, hoo, hoo. Tell him I'm not happy about that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I love you, bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Freakin' put this on Instagram. Hey, everyone. Scott, what's my caption? Threesome. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. Triplets. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Two in the front, one in the back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did you put it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My caption for this picture... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What I'm titling it is "two in the pink, one in the stink." I'm gonna go... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, all right, let's go get something to eat. I'm hungry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I haven't had chips and guac in so long. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God, you shoved that thing in there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I had years of practice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! One of the few things you don't want to hear come out of the mouth of your daughter. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I meant eating tacos. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, this is awkward. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did Kourt tell you about Mase trying to do a dance party for Rob but, like, was so shy? And then P was, like, slowly rocking it out. So then he got jealous. So then-then he started doing it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Auntie Khloe is great, but... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...it's important that their dad's around. The other day when we were over at the house, we kept looking for you, and you were, like, gone. I go, "Where the hell did Scott go?" And Kourtney didn't even know, but I guess you had left. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you do that a lot-- just vacate the premises? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Try to, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have this great urge to get out of the house? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. You know, I definitely go in and out of happy and dark places in my life, and I wish that I could be a little bit more consistent, and I wish it was a little bit easier for me to be under control, but it's not, and, you know, it's something I've always wanted to change. It's just not as simple as people think. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have this great urge to get out of the house? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I always have an urge to get out of the house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just want you to know, because, you know, I've had... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You've been through it all. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When you're older, or you're my age, the most proud thing I am about my life is the great kids I've raised. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, no, I know that you've been through both. I mean, and you missed some times. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been... I've been through everything, um... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: With your oth... with the others boys, and now you know how important, but at least you're making it up now, which is awesome. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bottom line: that's what life's all about. Kind of that next generation. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know? And that's important stuff. And the little tidbits you can give them to help them, make them a better person. And you never know when those times were... are gonna come that you can do that, so you got to be around all the time. 'Cause as time go on, and the kids start growing up, it only gets more and more difficult. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I get it. I want to be there. And the kids are old enough. They know now, you know? You know, I definitely realize that this is one of the times that Kourtney needs me the most, and I want to give her everything that she deserves. It's just been a very big struggle with my own stuff. And I wish I could throw it out, but I can't, but I'm gonna do everything I can in order to get back to where I need to be. And I really just want Kourtney to be happy, because she deserves that. I thought it was gonna be, like, way crazier with three kids, so that's why I was running out the door, 'cause I was scared. But now I realize, it's not so bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And it's not just what you do. It's just being there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Like, Dad's here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, if it's only two and a half hours to get home, better I get home tonight than wake up tomorrow, hit traffic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I'll ride home with him. I live... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're gonna leave me just like that? You can't take another ride with me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that what you're trying to say? You didn't enjoy our ride up here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to drive me home? She could drive... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott can take you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT and KHLOE: Oh! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See how easy that was? Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Two in the pink, one in the...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sink, or whatever you said. I don't know what you said. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you're right. One in the sink. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's just so crazy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I came home last night late. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How was it? Did you go dune buggying? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, we rented, like, some little ones-- me and Khloe and Bruce. And, I mean, it was fun. We had a good time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's nice. I thought you were staying longer. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know how Bruce is. He was telling me that I need to be home more. And I did realize that, why am I gonna waste time spending a night in the middle of Pismo Beach with Bruce when I could be home with you and the kids? So I was like, forget it. I'll just drive home now than stay another day and waste time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's nice. It's really hard because Scott goes through super high highs and then really low lows. And, you know, I don't always know what to do, but I know that I don't want to leave somebody when they're at their lowest. And it's always gonna be a constant struggle. No relationship is perfect. But Scott is an amazing father to our kids, and I am going to be here to support him during this struggle. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, what's the plan for today? Should we go pick up Mason? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, that would be fun. He would be excited. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, come give me a hug. Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Welcome home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that fish? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, will you please put the lid on that if you're not eating it? It really smells a little &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I smell &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You've been with somebody withthat smells like straight-up cod? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You smell like cod. So, I was in a car ride yesterday, and I chose to go with Bruce. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yeah, how was Pismo Beach? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I had fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was two hours and 20 minutes, the drive. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It wasn't two hours, 20 minutes; it was three hours. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Bruce decides to eat a foot-long tuna sandwich the entire car ride with the windows... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That is the worst thing ever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...with the windows rolled up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew, that's so rude. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's so rude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was like, hmm, who should I ride home with on the way home? Scott, right? It will be way easier of a car ride. So I have no idea what was up Scott's ass... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't make it sound like a... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Literally, three hours of being fully interrogated. "So what's going on? What's happening with Khadijah and Bob? Wait, so Bob's starting a hedge fund? So does he change the kids' diapers? Does he take them to school and, like, does he actually play with them or, like, does he just put them in front of the TV?" "I don't know, Scott! Ask Bobby!" Then he's like, "So what's going on with French? Like, how does he get at his house every month? Do you hear he was looking at a house in Calabasas? It's really weird, huh?" And he's like, "So what does he do? Like, how many more albums does he have? Does, like...?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're the worst person to talk... She was trying to use her phone. That's basically what it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was trying to have a conversation with my sister. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But how funny was it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that weird? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How funny... Weren't we hysterically laughing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. Then she would be, like... she would get mad that I asked too many questions. She'd be like, "Please, please, please, please give me five minutes, give me five minutes. Can I have five? Can I have five? Can I have five?" I was like, "I'll give you four." She'd sit for one minute without questions, she'd be like, "I'm ready again." If you go to dinner or lunch with her, she's like, "Oh, , got to go. Bye. I'm going to Pilates, and I'm going to a workout class, then I got to meet Gunnar, then I got to go to an appearance, then I got to go to New York, then I got snowed in." And I'm like, "Dude, you know, it's a lot." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm busy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wouldn't it be so cool if North and Reign got baptized in Jerusalem? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That would be incredible. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, right? I'm gonna find out the baptism site of Jesus Christ. Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: "This is the official Web site of the baptism site of Jesus Christ, where 2,000 years ago, Jesus came to be baptized by John." I want a guy named John to baptize North. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure we can find you a John. How did Kanye's video turn out? &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you see it? Can I show you? This was right in the back of our house. ♫ ♫ He said it was shot on an iPhone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Awesome. ♫ ♫ Who shot it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Spike Jonze. ♫ ♫ It's so cool to have these memories of North being so young and being in a video with her dad. ♫ ♫ We can look back and have these moments to last forever. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think it's so cool. Did you know what Kanye told Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, how I got him those boots? &gt;&gt; KIM: He loves them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was like, "Kourt, do you know what an honor that is?" 'Cause he went and bought a second pair of the boots. It means he really likes it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, no. He went and met with the designer and was like, "You have to custom make me these in every color," and the guy did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a big deal. &gt;&gt; KIM: And he walked into the store, and they were like, "Ah, the guy who wears the boots is here!" And now they're rereleasing the boot because of that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He is one of a kind. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was such a good gift. &gt;&gt; MAN: Beautiful! Keeping Up with the Kardashians... What are you doing, you guys? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We could be, like, the ultimate design team. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is supposed to be a business project. I mean, by the time she gets done, I'll be losing money. You being the decorator just doesn't work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at Kylie's lips. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She got a little crazy. &gt;&gt; MAN: People were talking a lot about your lips. Tell me about them.
