- Previously on Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim and Kanye have been obsessed with each other and the fact that she's going off to marry the love of her life, it's just the greatest thing in the world. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. It is probably the most beautiful dress I've ever seen in my life. He's gonna love it so much. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: He is. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so beautiful. It's really a dream come true. You have our passports, right? We are off to Paris. I can't believe the wedding is right around the corner. I am so excited. Are you ready to go to Paris, cutie? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Where are we? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're in Paris. Officially. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's the Eiffel Tower. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: We're in Paris! ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe we're finally in Paris for Kim and Kanye's wedding. This is so exciting and it feels magical. I can't wait. Kourtney and I love Paris. It's always our tradition to hit the ground running. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY:We're in Paris, Mason. Do you want to just get vanilla? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at this. I mean, it's such a beautiful night, I can't even stand it. We're in Paris, bitches! Today's the day that we're going to see our dresses for the wedding for the very first time. And we're so excited. It's really feeling very real. Kanye, what are we doing? We're doing the lace? &gt;&gt; KANYE: Just pull up the bottom of the slip. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Like this? &gt;&gt; KANYE: I thought this was gonna be lower. Do you like where that's at? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I thought it was going to be lower. &gt;&gt; KANYE: You thought it was gonna be lower, so do you want it lower? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I think it might be better lower. Maybe ask Kim? Because I don't want to, like, make it too low and be, like, the tramp at the wedding. Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to look at the dress? &gt;&gt; KIM: Really quick. Do you like it or don't you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it's beautiful. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Even lower than this though? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, she needs a bra. &gt;&gt; KANYE: You see what happens when you have, like, straight guys in the group? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you like it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yours is pretty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is it? I just don't know about this. My bridesmaid's dress is beautiful, but it's somewhat suffocating, and besides my immediate family, nobody knows that I'm pregnant. So, I just don't if it's the best dress for concealing a baby bump. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. Hey, you're here. Hi, guys. Welcome to Paris! Kendall, Kylie and Khloe finally got to Paris. They're my bridesmaids, so we have to hurry up. We have to do our whole fitting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kanye, I love your place. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have so much to do. I'm just really excited that everyone's here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't... But these bumps will go away? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: No, no... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. And then this whole side? You're just gonna make it the same? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Do we wear this the whole time? Like, we don't change after? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I just have to get it definitely fitted a lot more. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like... but, like, they look phenomenal in theirs. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can tell that the girls aren't loving their dresses. It is really, really hard to find a dress that will fit all of my sisters' body types. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would just love to do a second fitting just to make sure. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Every single person has a different shape, height, whatever. When we first ordered these dresses, I had no idea Kourtney would be pregnant. I want everyone to feel really comfortable and just love what they have. It's really hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The countdown begins, Kim. The countdown begins. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yeah, let's go to the Eiffel Tower. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott just arrived in Paris, and I really don't think he's in the mood to deal with all these people and paparazzi. I'll call you once we get Mason. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I thought it was gonna be crazy, but I didn't think it was gonna be this crazy. &gt;&gt; MAN: Keep moving. If you block me, I'm moving. You got it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to get out of here! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Thank God you videotaped that. My first time at the Eiffel Tower. I'm so happy to get it on video. I've been wanting... This is so awesome! &gt;&gt; KIM: All of my friends are starting to arrive to Paris. And it's so much fun. I want to take everyone to my favorite restaurant, see the Eiffel Tower, see everything that's iconic in Paris. Just to kind of give all of our friends and family a glimpse of the life that Kanye and I live in Paris. You're at the Eiffel Tower for the first time with this lovely crowd. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Holy crap. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kim! Kim! Kim! Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: There's obviously a lot of people around and it's intense, but I want to have fun with my friends. I want to show them around. And I don't want anything to stop us. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're dirtying the whole carpet! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Look... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no! &gt;&gt; KIM: I have my final dress fitting. Audrey Hepburn has had fittings in this same room. And it's such a cool experience that I really want to just share with my family. And show them this amazing gorgeous gown. &gt;&gt; MAN: We are missing one, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KIM: I know Khloe didn't want to come 'cause she's not feeling good about herself. She was feeling really ugly. But I really wish she was here to see it. First of all, what happened was he went over there, I mean, just to be really honest, he went over... Oh, but you know what, no. I can't tell you, I can't tell you. I know, but no one knows so I can't. I just realized that. I almost blurted it out and ruined the surprise. The wedding is gonna be in Italy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, slip this little number on, I would love to see it. KENDALL: When does Dad come? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! Wow. That is beautiful. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: The train looks so good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Has Kanye seen it? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, he can't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, that's the tradition. I just wondered, knowing him. He's... It's so pretty, Kim. The train is beautiful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love the back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just beautiful. They did such a gorgeous job. We're gonna go, otherwise he's going to be late. &gt;&gt; KIM: When you go to Rob's fitting, you have to make sure no one follows you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I'm picking him up at the back of the hotel. &gt;&gt; KIM: But the paparazzi... &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're gonna drop me off in the front like I'm going in and then we will go the other way. I'm so thrilled. Rob finally made it. Got him to Paris. But unfortunately we had a little run-in with the paparazzi at the airport. And at this point, I feel like he just wants to hide in his room. &gt;&gt; KIM: I totally can relate to what Rob's going through and feeling attacked when everyone is just coming at you and kicking you when you're down and not feeling good about yourself. So, it breaks my heart and I feel for him. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, Kim. We love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See you later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna get you. Come on. Come on. We can get her in a little bit. Oh, will you take my phone and video her? Cutie! Can we try hers on? Come here, cutie. You know, the fact that we can have our daughter in this memory with us is so, so, so special. Like, she's gonna wear a matching dress made out of the same lace as I am. I'm just so thankful that she's gonna be able to share these memories with us. ♫ ♫ I can't believe the wedding is almost here. Literally, the veil is so big that when I get there, he needs to pick it up like this. 30 minutes to be ready. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's gonna take you more than 30 minutes to do your makeup. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. We just have, still, so much more to do. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: We can open the door. Paparazzi is, like, on a crazy hunt to figure out what's going on in our wedding. Usually, when I come to France, the paparazzi is not really that crazy. But it's wedding week and the whole family's here, so it is just amped up so crazy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, I took a video of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Keeks... &gt;&gt; KIM: You did? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...you look so pretty. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can wear this one day with your blue hair. We must talk. The blue hair, I've got to be honest, um... are you going to get clip-ins or something to make it not blue? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, uh, dark spray. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. I cannot stop staring at her blue hair. Like, why does she have to have blue hair at my wedding? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I can do clip-ins, too, and then... and then any blue that shows, I can... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...spray it. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's a good idea. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you look so dope. &gt;&gt; KIM: Olivier just came over. He dressed me. He designed... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He brought over that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. He brought over my party dress for the reception. Oh, my God, it's to die for. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do we have party dresses? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What kind of a wedding is this? I get nothin' for free. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tonight, my Aunt Shelli Azoff and Lorraine Schwartz set up this dinner for us. It's just all the girls that are in town, and then hopefully I can get all the girls to run around Paris for the night, and just show them all the fun places, and just have a fun night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are we doing tomorrow? Oh, we have to be ready by noon, or...? &gt;&gt; KIM: We have to be ready at my place at noon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So be ready by 11:30. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. And then... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: We'll all follow and we're gonna go... all go in cars like this. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I just have a black jumper. That's all I really have. &gt;&gt; KIM: Perfect. That's fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall, you're a high-fashion model. &gt;&gt; KIM: Supermodel. You can do anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You could wear a... I hate you, okay? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, can you stop talking? We told you to stop talking for, like, the weekend. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you're not allowed to talk anymore. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You can't embarrass us in front of Kim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, seriously, she looks like, um, a matador... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So she speaks... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...and I'm her bull. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...and says something good, then we have to... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Capisce? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yeah. Capisce. ♫ ♫ Okay, so this is it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How am I going to get out, 'cause my vagina... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe we get out on this side. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I was thinking that, too. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. I'm so glad you guys are in Paris. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi! &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God, &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The pictures of her are so cute. &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: Is she walking yet, or she's about to? &gt;&gt; KIM: She's about to. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: When I said that all the paparazzi... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...this is my first time taking her out in public shopping. She doesn't know what cameras are. Do not yell one word to me. And they didn't say one thing. They were so much more respectful. &gt;&gt; TRACY: Is she talking yet, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. She says "bye-bye." If you really are like, "Say bye-bye" and give your hand, she'll go, "Ba-ba." And sometimes she'll put her hand up and go "ba-ba." &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: By the way, guys, everybody has to think of a story that they have of Kim and make a toast to her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cute. Where is Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KIM: I wish Kourtney could be here, but her and Scott are busy taking care of their kids. They wanted to get them all settled in. Brandon and Leah just got in, so my mom planned a separate dinner with just them. So everyone's kind of all over the place, but my little sisters, Khloe's here and all my best friends. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: All right, LaLa knows the real dirt. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 4: LaLa knows it all. &gt;&gt; LALA: I mean, one thing I could say about Kim is that it's not a friendship that you would think, because we come from completely different backgrounds, you know? I grew up in the 'hood, she grew up in Beverly Hills, it's something completely different, but she's so generous and caring. I've been there through a lot of ups and downs with her. For a long time, I got so used to talking to you when things were... &gt;&gt; KIM: In the middle of the night. &gt;&gt; LALA: ...crazy and chaos and... my phone all day. Mel's like, "She called you 12 times. What's going on?" I was like, "It's some popping off right now." Now, it's-it's just so calm, and it's great, but it's-it's just great to see you so happy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Amen. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: Joyce! &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Let's hear Joyce's story. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Okay. One of my favorite stories about you and Kanye is that we went to the studio and he was so excited to play this song for her. The whole song was singing the word "awesome," like, over and over again. You know, like, wow, this guy is so passionate, 'cause he's playing this song that he's talking about is like this, really, really is like his love for her. You know, he just genuinely has a love for you and I just thought, like, I know in his heart, like, what he's so obsessed with. And it's really just who you are. You're, like, legit awesome. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you're awesome. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Wait, now it's KoKo's turn. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have a good one. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Stop it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I guess... Kanye's been in love with Kim... &gt;&gt; WOMAN 4: Forever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...since the minute he saw her. And I remember, I was there, and John Legend was actually at same party Kanye was at, and he was staring at Kim, like... &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: He's always loved her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...she was Cleopatra. And he could not stop looking at her, and any guy can look. He just always fought through that. He would always say to me, "I know this is something your sister has to go through, but I'm gonna be here waiting." And I would call Kim and say, "Kim, I love this guy for you. This guy is, like, your twin soul; you guys are two peas in a pod." And they're so obsessed with each other equally, and that's what the amazing part is. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 4: That's beautiful. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: It really is amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Amen. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 1: Cheers. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: Cheers. L'Chaim! &gt;&gt; ALL: Cheers. &gt;&gt; TRACY: So my story is... I want to say this was six or seven years ago. Kanye's manager e-mailed me and was like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; TRACY: ..."Kanye really, really wants Kim's number." And so then I hit her up, you know, and I was like, "Hey, like, do you want me to tell him, you know, tooff? Or do you want me to give... pass along the number?" And you were like, "Yeah, it's fine, give it to him." And I spoke to you, and you were like, "We were on the phone for eight hours." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: No, really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Eight hours straight. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: The first time? &gt;&gt; TRACY: The first... till, like, morning. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I didn't sleep all night. &gt;&gt; TRACY: It was, like, you know, when you first date someone in high school and you're on the phone the whole night? &gt;&gt; KIM: Then he called me in the morning and said, "So what are we gonna do?" And I said, "Well, I have a boyfriend, so we're not gonna do anything." &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: Aw... &gt;&gt; KIM: But we really connected when we talked, literally, for eight hours. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 1: Good story, good story. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: Cheers to that story. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 5: These stories are so interesting. &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: Okay, now it's my turn. : Can I tell them the Kanye story? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: What story? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: Kanye actually wanted to marry Kim years ago. &gt;&gt; LALA: I know. &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: He was madly in love with her then. He literally talked about her for an hour, about how much this woman means to him and how much he loves her. It's amazing what time does, and the right timing does. But this is the right time. They have the most beautiful daughter, Kim is the most wonderful... eloquent, elegant people I've ever met. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hear, hear. &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: And I love you both. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: That is so sweet! &gt;&gt; KIM: I know it's a lot, to come all the way to Paris, and it means a lot to me. &gt;&gt; RACHEL: We love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm really excited... &gt;&gt; RACHEL: We love you, that's why we're here. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...to, you know, just spend this time with you guys. 'Cause we spend so much time here in Paris, and it's really fun to be able to share these experiences with you guys. It really means a lot to me. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Cheers! &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: Thank you for joining in the fairy tale. So are you gonna go out tonight, or not? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's take a picture. &gt;&gt; PASCAL: Whoa, whoa! Please, can we just take the one picture? I understand the excitement, but please, they want a picture. That's why we're coming, okay? Guys! Please! &gt;&gt; KIM: Pascal, did you get it? &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: 1,600 other people got it, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're all blown out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tonight has been such an amazing memory with all my best friends, running around... &gt;&gt; RACHEL: Eiffel Tower! &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Oh, my God, this is amazing. &gt;&gt; RACHEL: Amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just, these are the types of nights that you'll never forget. All right! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm happy my dad finally made it to Paris. And I can tell he's definitely excited to see us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, slow down. I'm stuck. How long is this for? &gt;&gt; SHARON: As fast as we can get it done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, Bruce has to leave here in 45 minutes, so whatever you wanted him to do... Yeah, but I mean, just let them know... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They'll be here in five minutes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're here for the wedding rehearsal and the bride is late. I hope she gets here before Bruce has to leave for his tux fitting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're here. How you doing, babe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you look so beautiful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have a good day? You're almost married. ♫ La, la, la, la, la. ♫ &gt;&gt; SHARON: All right, shall we get started? Everybody... &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, let's line up the guys here. Okay, let's ask this. Babe, we have to ask some questions. Do you want to walk down the aisle or do you want to just come down from the side? I think you should just stand. Just come from the side. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Probably. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Okay, so it'll be you... First the pastor would come from the side, then it would be you and then you'd be there to sort of welcome everybody as they walk up the aisle, okay? All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I think it should be my mom... &gt;&gt; SHARON: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and his dad. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Would your dad want to walk down the aisle with my mom and then they cross to sit in their seats? That's proper. &gt;&gt; SHARON: That would be very nice. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Okay. Okay. And then we've got... We paired everybody up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so she was also saying that North, it's not safe for her to go in a carriage, and that someone should actually hold her walking down the aisle. Who should that be? &gt;&gt; KANYE: Well, who-who... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, Kimmie. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I get it. Wouldn't that be so amazing? &gt;&gt; KIM: What if she's under the veil? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want me to hold North? &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, can you carry her? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, shouldn't it be Kendall because she's last? &gt;&gt; KIM: Or Bruce could carry North walking down. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I could be holding her and the two of us could go around and grab you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's too much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, no, no, no. No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe she could come walking... &gt;&gt; SHARON: Can I say... I think that's a great idea. Don't get mad at me, but I don't like it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The baby should probably walk it. &gt;&gt; SHARON: I don't think it's gonna flow right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. The wedding is right around the corner and everyone is giving suggestions on what should happen, and... &gt;&gt; SHARON: There's too many people. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just need everyone to calm down and everyone to just chill out for one second. &gt;&gt; SHARON: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know you guys did not love the dresses... the first dresses. We have found another designer to bring all-new bridesmaids dresses. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I really like how this is sheer. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I think it might be risqué. &gt;&gt; KIM: At this point, if these don't fit right, there's not much else we can do. We had brunch at Valentino's home. He invited the whole family to this castle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's been one big surprise after another. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, either your dad can go by himself and then my mom can go and carry North, or... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Or the three of them could go together. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Yeah, that's cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That would be cute to me. &gt;&gt; SHARON: That would be great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Okay, one thing I'm gonna say is smile! No hands in your pockets. You can imagine what Kanye would say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No gum. &gt;&gt; SHARON: We have one chance to do this and we're gonna do it right, okay? That's perfect. Okay, so... &gt;&gt; KANYE: ♫ Da, da... ♫ &gt;&gt; SHARON: Slow, slow, slow... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll really do it slow. &gt;&gt; SHARON: And... smile, and now. And one... slow... And now. All right, now here come the kids. Slow, slow... slow, slow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe you should wear no heels. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'll just go barefoot. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe the wedding is almost here. In just two days, I'm gonna be walking down the aisle and I am so excited. I wish I had a veil, 'cause it's gonna be really hard to walk. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I'm in, like, row three, I'll come out. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Okay, and then... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Grab your arm. &gt;&gt; KIM: The problem is I have a huge veil on. I can't... You can't hold me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can he hold your hand? &gt;&gt; SHARON: He can do... what he can do is this. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's down to the ground. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Give me-- give me your wrist. Yeah. Just so she doesn't feel the pressure. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; SHARON: No. Open, open, not... Open, just like that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Just touch her. That's it. &gt;&gt; KIM: But-but then, my other question is... literally, the veil is so big, when I get there, he needs to bend down and, like, lift it up like this. And then put it over... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And we'll all... &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and they can, like, help grab it. &gt;&gt; SHARON: You can help, and then that's your cue to sit down. Okay, so, Bruce, Kanye... before he gets seated, you will give... you hug him. And then he takes his seat and then Bruce hands you her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Or handshake, whatever, like... &gt;&gt; SHARON: Whatever makes you comfortable. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Maybe I can hug like this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Yeah! We can just do a normal hug. &gt;&gt; SHARON: And now you're going to take your bride. You say, "I do." &gt;&gt; KIM: I do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're still in the middle of rehearsal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They didn't say "I do" yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say "I do!" &gt;&gt; KIM: I do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: I do. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I do. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Okay, and then you kiss. You take her arm and you go right back. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so happy. Everything is going perfectly, as planned, and we just all have such a good time. How do we plan to kiss? What kind of kiss do you want to do? Do you want to do this? But we have so much more to do. Just take a deep breath and everything will work out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you bring dress socks? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no. Not these with the tux. You need to tell... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I brought black socks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Black dress socks? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I mean, they're at the hotel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, yeah. But you have black dress socks? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Oh... my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, so... We have those bridesmaid dresses from yesterday that will be at the location. I know you guys did not love the dresses, the first dresses, so we have all kind of been in a kind of panic mode of what to do. I cannot believe we pulled this off. We have found another designer to bring all-new bridesmaids dresses. I am praying that my sisters like these dresses. At this point, if these don't fit right, there's not much else we can do. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's much better! Except it's very short. &gt;&gt; DESIGNER: Ooh, pretty! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But I just like this part. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys love it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it going to be lined? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, so how sheer is it gonna be? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's gonna be lined, yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: I say we do sheer on the nips. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love sheer nips. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love sheer nips. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But I like it sheer here. So it's not gonna be sheer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what she just said. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Can we... can I see what this is like when this is closed up, since this is...? I think it might be risqué. &gt;&gt; DESIGNER: Okay, I'll show you. &gt;&gt; KANYE: You can get all the sheer... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, but I really like, um, how this is sheer. Like, I like this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I actually like this. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I don't think it looks that bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I... maybe we just double-line this. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Just one more. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I like this all being the same, but if it's gonna be... &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, let's have Kourt try it also, 'cause they... everyone... Kourtney has the biggest boobs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kendall has the most perfect body, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, she's probably not the best example to try it on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, Kendall. you. Take the dress off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll try it on. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. But I like it, so... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do you like the slit? Is it too much? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like the slit, but I don't think it should be, like vagina slit. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KANYE: It's too much. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I like the slit, as well. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The slit's dope. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Once this is fitted, I think it will be fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your belly. It looks really thin. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: The girls all want a slit. &gt;&gt; DESIGNER: Okay, it's up to you, Kim. Whatever you guys want. I think Kanye felt it was a little too vulgar. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This second bridesmaid's dress is 100 times better than the first one. It fits better, it's simpler. I think everyone will look so much better. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so happy that the girls love their dresses. It's such a relief, and I'm so thankful that Kanye has these connections, that he was able to call someone and get a dress in, like, a day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See you. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Looks nice. But what did we decide on? I think no slit. I know everybody likes the slit, but I think it's distracting. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think, when trying to figure out the look, Kanye sees a vision and there's some things in Florence that he has even for a surprise for me, so I definitely want his input, 'cause I haven't seen anything in Florence. And he, you know, recommends that it's just more elegant without the slit, and of course the girls kind of want a slit... &gt;&gt; DESIGNER: Without? &gt;&gt; KANYE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DESIGNER: Okay. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Without. &gt;&gt; DESIGNER: Without the slit. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, sit down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut theup. I am so hungover, so trying to race and get ready for Kim's wedding is torture, at this point. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want some hair of the dog? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shh. Don't talk about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I told them tiny. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kim is nervous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Take this out. Like, all of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're hours away from her walking down the aisle, and I think Kim's getting a little bit overwhelmed. You ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: Ah! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye and I, we fell in love in Paris and then, for my birthday, he took me to Florence and that's where we conceived our gorgeous little baby girl. So why not bring everyone on our full love journey and bring them from Paris to Italy? How much fun was last night? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it was so fun. Last night Kanye told us we're all flying to Florence in the morning. To Florence. We're flying to Florence. It's been one big surprise after another. It was one of the best nights. Like, it was magical. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was the craziest day, yesterday. We had brunch at Valentino's home-- he invited the whole family to his castle. It was just a special day, having this brunch and looking out at the gardens. Valentino took us around, showing us his gorgeous grounds. It was just such a memorable day. And then, as a surprise for everyone, we went to Versailles for the night. We had people in every room dressed up. They would tell you all of the historic details as you walked through the palace. And then, downstairs, everyone was drinking and eating. It was one of the best nights ever. That was just so much fun-- fireworks in the rain. Now, like, we have, like, pictures of, like, Kendall dancing in the rain at Versailles with Olivier Rousteing and Alexander Wang. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every time I turned around there was somebody else's face and I was like, "Oh, my God, you're here." &gt;&gt; KIM: It was so much fun. Like, who shuts down Versailles? Like, they've only shut it down, like, once before. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: We had fun. I'm so tired. Just thinking about this day, I'm like... So much to plan in so little time. I just can't believe it's, like, we're already now on the plane on our way to Florence. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're hours away from Kim walking down the aisle, and, you know, I think Kim's getting a little bit overwhelmed. We have to be out of here at a certain time. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's definitely stressful. The ceremony is supposed to start, we have 30 minutes to get ready. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's gonna take you more than 30 minutes to do your makeup. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I'm not missing my wedding. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ready to go. Mommy and Daddy are getting married. Give me a kiss. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, sit down. Get up here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have a headache. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, get up here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut theup. Shut theup. Just touched down in Florence, we are trying to get to our hotel and I am so hungover. So trying to race and get ready for Kim's wedding is torture at this point and... I don't know, I just feel like I'm holding back throwing up. Drinking as much as I did last night probably was not smart. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; CONCIERGE: Hi, welcome to the Belmond, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kourtney. &gt;&gt; CONCIERGE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is Penelope and Mason. &gt;&gt; CONCIERGE: How are you, Penelope, how are you, Mason? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is so beautiful. &gt;&gt; CONCIERGE: Where's Daddy? He's coming? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, he's coming with all the guys. It's so beautiful, this view. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is where Kanye and I came for my birthday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I need a minute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want some hair of the dog? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shh. Don't talk about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you know what that means? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take the same thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I'm officially done. Look at this one. How cute. Kourt? You see Riccardo dressing me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me see. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You did it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's done. I love to make selfie books for Kanye and for his birthday, I made him a selfie book and he loved it. So for our wedding, I made him a new one. I hope he likes it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Eff France. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I like Italy better, too, so far. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, it's just, first of all, the food. And, like, this just couldn't be any prettier. I do love Paris, but this is where I want to move. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. It's incredible. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you seen my phone somewhere? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to be out of here at a certain time. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's definitely stressful. The ceremony is supposed to start and we have 30 minutes to get ready and we just have, still, so much more to do. The guys aren't even there yet. Khloe is sleeping while they're doing her makeup. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, hey, girls. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, have you even started your makeup? &gt;&gt; KIM: Nope, gonna start now. We have 30 minutes to be ready. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's gonna take you more than 30 minutes to do your makeup. &gt;&gt; KIM: We cannot leave later than 30 minutes, and I'm not missing my wedding. The music is starting. &gt;&gt; KIM: I gotta go. The nerves are setting in. In a couple minutes I'm gonna be walking down the aisle. I just can't believe this moment's here. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: How was your flight? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: How pretty is this hotel? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wish Rob was here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob ended up not getting on the plane from Paris to Florence, and he got on a flight all the way back to Los Angeles. I just can't believe he's gonna miss Kim's wedding. I mean, this is something you're never gonna be able to see again, and it's upsetting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mase. &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to go to Mom's room. &gt;&gt; KIM: When Rob flew to Paris, he read some nasty comments about himself and he just didn't feel comfortable and he didn't want to see all my guests. And, you know, it makes me so sad for him. It's just... It's heartbreaking, it really is. And I just... I don't even want to think about it. I don't want to talk about it. Today is my wedding, and I don't want to cry. I just want to, you know, have it be a happy day with amazing memories, and we'll talk about Rob when we get home. ♫ ♫ I wish we all got a little bit more sleep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow. Get your paws off of me, you little daredevil. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I told them tiny. I mean, if you could make it smaller if we have time, I'd like them both smaller. I like really... Yeah. Tiny. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay, half as small... smaller. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you think Kim is nervous? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Would you be nervous to walk down the aisle? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, I'd be... I think I'd be more excited than nervous. If it was the right person. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I guess... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'd be nervous if-if I didn't know, if I wasn't sure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's a lot of pressure on you and everybody watching you. That's one of the reasons, I think, me and my Kourtney don't get married. It's just too much. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, you guys should get married. For sure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just like... There's just a... All this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Too many people all trying to help. Like, "I'll grab it, I'll grab it, I'll grab it." And I'm like, "Leave my alone." I'm always like, "Leave me alone." Do you know how much drama I've been through over the last month about my hair? Ponytail? No ponytail? I mean, the list has gone on and on and on. Let's be honest, it is Kim's day, you know? Let her pick the guy who's gonna do the ponytail, the hair and makeup guy, everything. We want the pictures to be perfect. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He looks like one of those guys, like, from the Marie Antoinette days. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I like it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not to be crazy but does the part look a little bit too much to here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This could be you, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, thanks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie, let me see. Kendall, are you dressed? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Should I take some of these long danglies off so I match a little better? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's fine. Kylie's hair is still blue, and she promised me she would put extensions in to cover it. It's just not worth the battle and I'm just gonna let it go and she has blue hair at my wedding. I think we take this out and we do it more down behind the ears. Like, all of it. It's time to walk down the aisle. I can't keep people waiting. It's taking forever to put this veil on. It's so heavy. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: The veil is so heavy. It's gonna smash it around her face. It's gonna do different things. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I love this long, huge veil, but it's the only thing that would make me trip and fall right on my face. And it makes me so nervous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: So I don't know if I can wear it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We ready? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: One second. &gt;&gt; KIM: Walking down the aisle with this huge veil makes me nervous. It's the longest veil, I think, in history. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, love it. It's a miracle. &gt;&gt; KIM: The wedding planner goes, "She needs to leave in five minutes" with the fa... with the eyes like... So I'm like, "What? There's a surprise." So my guess is someone is singing as I walk out. I don't know who. I'll tell you who my favorite singers are. Andrea Bocelli and Kanye. Those are my two favorites of life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. Love you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Love you. Be safe. You know what to do. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Should we put the veil on now? &gt;&gt; KIM: The music is starting. I gotta go. The nerves are setting in. In a couple minutes, I'm gonna be walking down the aisle. For the months and months of prep that we have spent getting this whole day together, I can't believe that it's almost here. Oh, my God. It's crazy that, you know, Kanye and I have been so close for so many years. I finally feel like, you know, I'm marrying my best friend. ♫ ♫ I'm so just thankful to have him in my life, and I just can't believe this moment's here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MAN: Turn around and come this way, please. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Next season on Kourtney and Khloe Take the Hamptons... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is for the summer. This is our house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ah! I got to put a Lord Disick flag out there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's bigger than the American flag. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It should be. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here we come, Hamptons! &gt;&gt; KIM: This is so nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. : Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you have a girlfriend? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That would be such a bonus if you had a chef for a boyfriend. Who is that out there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to a fancy place called South Africa. That's so dope. &gt;&gt; FRENCH: That right there, bro. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to take a picture and send it to Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you think about French Montana? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just hope nothing goes wrong. She doesn't need any heartache. &gt;&gt; FRENCH: Looking at the baddestcouple in the land. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Watch that baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're finding out the sex. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is that Kourtney's heart or the baby's heart? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The baby's. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Reporting live from the marble bathtub! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Watch out! What's going on with your mom, by the way? Is she dating? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Be careful what you say to him. He very well could be our leak. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What do I get out of selling a story about a therapist? &gt;&gt; KIM: You were the only person that I told. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're a bitch. Goyourself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just want to have some fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You did it the entire trip in Paris. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And you're lucky I haven't done it here! I wish things could work, but we've been doing these talks for so many years. I'm sotired. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you're gonna break up with him if he wants to be a lunatic? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; GUARD: Your car is not allowed on the property. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Says who? Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Unless you want to be sober, then I don't want you here. And if you want to die, then you can continue to act this way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He took the entire thing, every pill. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He took all the pills. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: The combination of drugs is not a good mix. Let them wear their way out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott might be going to rehab. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know what to do.
