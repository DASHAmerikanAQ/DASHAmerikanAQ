- &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm gonna do my lipstick. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get it up there. You should want your nose to almost hit your lip, like... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's what I think. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There you go! Plump her up! You should go to the mall, go to Courrier and get one more bracelet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My mother says to keep it uneven, so I'm at seven now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your mother's going through a lot of stuff. She's, like, newly single. We got to get her in the playing field. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just don't know what kind of man she expects or is gonna want, at this point. Definitely African-American. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't think African-American. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 100%. Good looking, semi-funny, same age, all right. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think same age, but I don't think she thinks same age. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But she thinks "same age" is, like, 40. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And she's not really 40... she's older than that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She's definitely a cougar. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's definitely a "coug." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't want her to know that I'm, like, talking to you about it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It makes sense, it is a bit weird for you. I just feel like you're so grown up... even though you're younger than you look. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Younger than I look? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How old are you? 17. What do you look like? 25. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 25, you think? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Should I date your mom? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Probably. That seems like definitely where this conversation is heading. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just feel like that may make more sense. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: For sure. Younger... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Boy toy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who can we hook Kourtney up with? &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: It's been too long. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi! How are you. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Great to see you. Thank you for coming. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love that-- did you put that up just for today? &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Uh, no, believe it or not, that's there all the time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Cool! &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: And then we have the whole board room set up to talk through what we're gonna do with the game in the next few months. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! Those are so cute! I'm in San Francisco meeting with my whole Glu team to talk about new updates for my app. Kim Kardashian Hollywood. It's this fun app where you kind of want to make it in Hollywood. And I just love being of it and coming up with really fun, creative ideas. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: So, you remember a couple months ago, we were talking through Bono's AIDS charity. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: And we had this brainstorm with you over, co... you know, could this game be part of the next Red campaign? We are giving away all of the proceeds to from certain Red items. Your mom, I'm sure,is gonna make it in for this update, as well. &gt;&gt; KIM: She looks amazing. I love her character. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Well, so, Kim, let's talk about whether or not we can talk your, your sisters into, uh, into joining the party. And I actually think that we'll expand the fan base with that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Assuring that we have the biggest fan base, the only game that does this and I really appreciate, uh, you going to bat for us. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe would love to. Kourtney is just always difficult. But I want her to be in it, 'cause she's my sister. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: I think that's a powerful picture, uh... &gt;&gt; KIM: I do, too. I love that. I really want to add my family members to the game because a game is supposed to mirror my real life, so I think it's just a fun way to add more characters and I'm always with them. I think it could just be cute and fun. Are any of the people that work on my game here? &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: Absolutely. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KIM: I-I'd like to meet them. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: There's lots of people here. Lots of people here. &gt;&gt; MAN: We'd love to do a champagne and cupcake toast out there, if you don't mind. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would love to, yeah. Thank you. I just want to thank everyone that works on the game and for pushing yourselves and being inspired and I haven't seen a response from my fan base on a game that they've really liked like this in a long time. So, it's because of, really, all of you guys, so thank you. &gt;&gt; NICCOLO: The feeling's mutual. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna stay away from those cupcakes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Kyles. The Puerto Rican mama. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ah, my old bed! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Have you seen her do her lipstick? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, it's crazy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It takes, like, 40 minutes, and then there's, like, she, like, pulls one lip, pushes one out... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ew! That's not cute! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I don't understand why everybody thinks it's so cute to, like, duck it out... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ew! Kylie, stop! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, that's sick! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You look like a worm! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying to fill Kenny in on her mom. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think she's texting someone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A guy? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: A guy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wow. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, this freaks me out, though, you guys. Thinking of her, like, flirting with someone. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just see my mom giggling and laughing at her phone and I think... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's sexting? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think we have to go steal her phone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, I'm gonna go grab it. It must be very difficult to jump back into the dating world 23 years later, but if she's sexting with other guys, it's very odd because, 20 years ago, I don't think you were getting laid over text messages. Hello! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can I use your phone? My phone died. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You want to use my phone? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I want to text Kourt, so I can't use the house line. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. There you go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks. I'll be just right here in your room. : Oh, man! I scrolled for a second... wait. Look at thisguy. "Hello back, Kris. Nice meeting you last night." I don't know who's who. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is this really real? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is... No, this is real. I don't know if Kris googled "how to be sexy over texts," but she's doing it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He sends her, like, selfies on selfies. Look at him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And it's inappropriate and it's very uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, stop! Please! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're freaking me out! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, oh, no. Did we just get proper? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who's Corey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? What are you guys doing doing with my phone? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean? I was texting... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? You were supposed to text Kourtney. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I did and then I just fell into all these conversations you were having with 20-year-old men and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me my phone! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, if I open it... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me, give me the phone! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hmm? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who's Corey? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My... Just stop! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I had no idea I was hitting a trigger. I don't know who this is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop! Why are you doing this to me? &gt;&gt; LISA: These are the two prints we're thinking about. Either a larger scale one or a small scale one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that sweatshirt is more girly than that one. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like this, but maybe for a boy. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Okay, cool. &gt;&gt; LISA: Okay, good, so we'll start working on that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. These are cute. Do you guys like this print? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a little more boyish to me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's why I don't really comment for the kid's stuff, 'cause you guys freak me out. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: We're done. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to talk to you girls for a sec. My video game-- I wanted to see if you guys are gonna be in it. We made the characters. It looks so cute. Kendall and Kylie want to. Um, Mom... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just don't make me look like a beast and I'm good. &gt;&gt; KIM: But it's not about the money. It's just gonna be something you're gonna do or not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't get why they use our name and likeness and don't pay us. Kim's making it seem like she's doing us a favor by having us in her video game. All these other people are doing it. I'm pregnant. I have a lot going on. I don't need to put myself into one more thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: But, like, I have to literally get you guys to sign for your name and likeness. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm... maybe. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, why am I not shocked? Kourtney always is difficult. When we were first starting out our careers, I would do anything to help them out. Kourtney doesn't have to lift a finger, she doesn't have to do anything. She should do this for me, like, with no questions asked. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does that mean I can't do my own video game if I want to? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, you should talk to these people. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We should do, uh, Kourtney and Khloe Take the World. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's see how many people pay for that upgrade. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, hey, guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, this is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did you just get back from Paris fashion week? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People that wear coats caped over their shoulders in the house... &gt;&gt; KIM: Now, when else can I wear a Chanel holey sweat suit? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, I saw your chiropractor today. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you like him? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's so nice. Don't you wish he would date Mom? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait! We need to discuss that Kylie and I just saw these text messages with some guy named Corey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait a minute, what do you mean? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who is this guy? Does anyone know who Corey is? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't. &gt;&gt; KIM: I do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You do? &gt;&gt; KIM: I took with me to Ibiza for Ricardo's birthday party. Justin was there. Bieber, and he works with him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doing what? Security? &gt;&gt; KIM: A road manager. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is this guy Corey's last name? &gt;&gt; KIM: Corey... Gamble. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here's the picture of him. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Let me see? Hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's 33. There's only a 26-year-old difference. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's younger than me. My mom has been out of the dating game for decades, so I want her to have fun again and to meet someone, but I just hope that she really thinks things through and doesn't just rush into anything. You know, I hope she's having fun and I want that for her, but it's just, obviously it's weird if she's dating someone new. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who are you talking to, Shady? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just this guy. He texts me all the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you guys hung out yet? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, for a couple of dinners. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you dating him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is a cease and desist for the Kim Kardashian West video game. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who is that from? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Getting back out there in the dating world is going to be very interesting. &gt;&gt; COREY: I'm a lucky &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your fire is not large at all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who are you smirking at? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nothing. What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you smiling like that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. Sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who are you talking to, Shady? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nobody. Just this guy I met in Spain. He's the guy I met at Riccardo Tisci's birthday party, when I went with Kim and Kanye. He texts me all the time. He's cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, he's cute? How old is he? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh... I don't know how old he is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you guys hung out yet? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, just, like, for a couple of dinners and stuff like that. Super cool, super chill, really nice... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you dating him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. Just hanging out right now. Getting back out there in the dating world is going to be very interesting and, hopefully, a lot of fun. I was married for 25 years and that's a long time to be kind of out of the loop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I think it's cute how much you're, like, smirking and smiling... like, I get-- I know that look and that feeling. But, like, that leads me to believe that you might, like, be into him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you the dating police? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're the one who's been saying, "Mom, get out there, get out there." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. But it's definitely weird when your mom is dating someone. No matter who he is. It takes a minute. Gotta, like... ease into it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: To get used to it. I'm sorry. It's ultimately going to be the hardest thing for me to... date somebody, because we all have such crazy, big lives and I have a lot of kids. And my kids are all really protective, especially you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All I said was, "Don't get married." And you said, "Don't worry. I'm not getting married." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I never... I don't think I would ever get married again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can whoever you want... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...just don't get married right now. There's a whole plethora of people out there in the world. We should all just enjoy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll see. I don't have a crystal ball. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure you're going the right way? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Um, I really don't know. But let's hope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 1815... Scott and I have an appearance in Canada together for Halloween. And I'm bringing my bestie, Malika, and Scott is bringing Chris Reda. So I don't even have a costume. I also found out, in the final hour, that Brody is the DJ at this party and Brody's a drinker. So I just want to be there for Scott, for a little extra support. It's Halloween, we get to dress up, and I'm really looking forward to let loose, have fun and just enjoy the night. So I couldn't fit into my sailor outfit. It just didn't look as good as RuPaul. So I might just be a sexy kitty in normal clothes and just wear a mask. It is so sexy. We've taken Halloween to a whole 'nother level. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: All this, to be a black pussy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can't really lift my glass, 'cause my arms are tight, so I have to go... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, the Lord! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: This is the greatest I've ever seen. Period. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Very chic. How'd you come up with this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, I've always wanted to be a Saudi prince, so... when the lordship doesn't take you far enough, you have to turn to the Saudi... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you have to advance. Let's go, Mama Jo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Instagram! What do I title ours? I just wrote, "Sheik pussy." Great. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's gonna be some disturbing comments to that picture. And I'm posting some pics. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Appropriate as " "Wow, this is soup." "Wow, that's offensive. Can't expect anything less from Kardashians." Wait, what's wrong with it? I don't understand. "You really did it this time, damn it." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Damn. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "What ayou are." "Rude to the Arabs. How dare you." Nothing is nice so far! I'm like, what's happening? Is this that bad? "It's a culture, not a costume. So disgusting and disrespectful." &gt;&gt; CHRIS: What'd you say, though? You said, "Sheik pussy." Yeah, but now Scott's gonna get it, because Scott just posted this one. So they're gonna get off you right now. These comments aren't that bad, Scott. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Like, everybody dresses up as something funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are Scott's comments not bad and I'm getting literal hate, but without even posting hate? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You want to know why? Because they know Scott doesn't give a &gt;&gt; CHRIS: "This is why he's our god." "Let's be A-rabs." &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Clearly, they expect more of you than they do of Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. That's true. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm getting, like... My intentions was not to hurt anyone's feelings or to go against someone's religious beliefs, but I don't understand how I posted the exact same Instagram Scott did and I'm literally being brutalized, while Scott is being praised and... I feel like, why am I not allowed to say the exact same thing? I'm not in any Muslim nothing-- I'm not even in a costume. I have ahead thing on. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's your comments. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Have some respect, you ignorant" &gt;&gt; CHRIS: "You're a funny cool and the Lord be with you." Literally, my lifegoal is to be you. Long live Lord Disick." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on, my girls. My second and third wife. Oh, my God... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Get us a round of shots. Round of shots! Are we getting drunk? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what I was waiting on. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Mind if we order some drinks? Could we get 1942 shots, please? Don Julio, one, two... uh, two... Are you good? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hope that by me being here tonight, Scott will choose the smarter decision in not grabbing that shot. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Cheers! A lot to talk about. The Sheik and the Lord. Okay, cheers. Thanks for coming, guys. You know, it's Halloween, everybody's getting crazy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, it's never easy watching other people having a huge party night. &gt;&gt; FANS: Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The crowd is definitely getting a little rowdy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was crazy! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to be in your video game. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's ridiculous. All theI've done for her? I bought her acareer. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: So I have our meet and greet people in the hallway. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come and meet Scott Disick, everyone! AKA "the Lord." &gt;&gt; FAN: Hey, it's nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, you, too! &gt;&gt; FAN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; FAN 2: For, like, real, I want your butt. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You do? &gt;&gt; FAN 2: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can have it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, how you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like your costume. &gt;&gt; FAN 3: Do you know who I am? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Henry? You are? Stop. Yay! Love Henry. You okay? No? &gt;&gt; FAN 3: You just, like, mean so much to me and... I don't know. You just, like... I'm not comfortable about my weight, but, like, watching you guys just makes me feel, like, a lot better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think about mine all the time. It goes up and down and it is what it is. &gt;&gt; FAN 3: No, but... you joke about it. It means a lot to me that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course we do. &gt;&gt; FAN 3: ...you came here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Want me to take a picture of you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't worry about it-- it is what it is. &gt;&gt; FAN 3: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Got to embrace it and love it. Okay. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No pouting, smile big. &gt;&gt; GIRL: I love you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Happy Halloween, Ottawa! &gt;&gt; MAN: Khloe! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: This is scary. &gt;&gt; MAN: I love you, Khloe. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was crazy! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He... Yo, he tried to atta... like, knock me down. Some guy tried to tackle me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was scared for her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The crowd is definitely getting a little rowdy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was absurd. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got that turban off. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Way better. I want tequila, you don't have tequila. &gt;&gt; WAITER: You want Jagermeister, too, though? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Oh, no, what else do you have? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to say, for not drinking, I'm having a pretty great time, but it seems like everybody's drinking more and having more fun and more fun. I think it's time. Should we get going? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can we get going? Honestly, I'd like to just call it a night for the first time in my life, and get to bed and get home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm happy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's cute. That's cute. Do I keep this little T-shirt that says "Robert"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you naming your kid that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but it's cute. Maybe just for, like, chill clothes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Green pants? If I ever wore green pants, you would kill me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but for a kid? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, do you dress kids the same way you dress an adult? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I don't. Did you get this e-mail from Kim's attorney to sign this contract? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So did you read it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not just for the charity. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So it's giving your name and likeness for... basically, forever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim sent over some legal documents for us to sign, so her video game can use our image and likeness and Kim's video game is a huge, like, pop culture phenomenon, and I feel like your sister's asking you to do something, so do it. Yeah, but it's a free video game. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, she doesn't get paid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't think she makes money off of this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, she... she makes money. It's not like you buy a Khloe person, like, I'm just, like, a free add-on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but you're adding to the game. Are you gonna do it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I am, 'cause she just wants me to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She just said, "So and so and so and so is doing it, do you guys want to do it?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but I... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And in the moment I said, "I'll think about it." But then I randomly got this contract sent. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't mind doing it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do whatever you want, I don't care. I'm just telling you I am not going to do it. After my conversation with Kim, I thought I made it really clear that I wasn't sure if I want to be a part of her video game, so I'm just not sure why I'm getting contracts from my attorney. I just... I'm really confused. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're ruthless. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, how cute are these? &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Khloe, over here. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Khloe, here, straight ahead, straight on me. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO 2: Look up, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KEN: Well, you look beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; KEN: I-I just said that and, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stared at my? &gt;&gt; KEN: Yeah, oops. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's okay, they're a mouthful, so that's all you need. &gt;&gt; KEN: Oh... Hello, uh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right? Good morning! &gt;&gt; KEN: God, it's early. Um, what is this random Kim tweet saying she loves you and French together? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's cute, right? I mean, we all miss French, we love French. &gt;&gt; KEN: Yeah, but you're not dating him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm still friends with him, I talk to him, like, every day, I talked to him before I came here, but I'm not dating anybody. &gt;&gt; KEN: Okay, I'm gonna break some news to you that is actual dating news. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, tell me. &gt;&gt; KEN: Um, I confirmed, actually, as I was driving over here, I confirmed that your mama... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KEN: ...is dating Corey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um... How did you confirm, 'cause I can't be tricked into this. &gt;&gt; KEN: Uh, sources, I have sources, I'm telling you that as a friend, I did confirm this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. I pretty much feel ambushed at this point, because my mom apparently gave quotes about her relationship with her new boyfriend and I don't know how to answer this question. My mom is really happy. &gt;&gt; KEN: Good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I like to see her in such a positive, happy state. It's a good Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; KEN: You're beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KEN: Love you more. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom-slash-manager is supposed to be giving me the heads-up, like, "Oh, by the way, you might be asked a question or two" and she's pretty much denied that she's dating Corey every time I ask her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello, Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you feel like maybe warning me that you were giving a confirmation that you're dating someone would be good before I did a press day? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't have... I did not confirm I was dating anybody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you should... I, you say nothing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you not talk to Ken Baker? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I did not talk to Ken Baker, I'm not confirming anything-- I don't know what's gonna happen, I could be dating somebody else next week. I'm getting him on the phone right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, you could seriously take aXanax and don'tyell at me like that, because I don't deserve this &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please don't be mad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just saying, as a manager, I would just like to know, because I'm, like, ambushed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so sorry, and I never confirmed it. It'll be yesterday's news in a week. One Flew Over theCuckoo's Nest with you, dude. I posted something on Instagram. I wrote, "Sheik pussy." Is that offensive? &gt;&gt; DURRANI: I think it's... 'cause you're covered. &gt;&gt; NAZY: What's more, like, upsetting is the words. &gt;&gt; KIM: For Scott to call me and say, "You should buy her a pair of shoes"-- I said, "I-I'm not buying her apair of shoes, I bought her a career." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Puscani. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here real quick. We'll go out... Your-Your dad'll take you outside in a minute. So Malika and I, like, we're both obsessed with Tomer. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's the best. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then Malika's like, "If Tomer wasn't a redhead"-- or a ginger or whatever-- she's like, "I would" and I was like, "You would what?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Has Malika ever dated a white man? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nick Carter. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: From the Backstreet Boys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, no! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So how was Canada for you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I had a good time. I feel like everybody was pretty tame, I mean, you guys were drinking a little. I had, like... a half a glass of wine and that was about it. And just relaxed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But is it hard for you to be ar... Like, Brody was, like, wild, and all of his friends get really wild. And they're like, "Let's do a shot." Like, I'm like, how old are you and how long are you gonna do shots for your whole life? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I could probably do them till I'm dead. But yeah, I mean, I just feel like I got to pick my battles, you know what I mean? I mean, listen, doing events and parties is one of my jobs. So it's like I don't want to mess that up and I feel like I can't go to these things and act like an animal. I just don't want to not be able to drink at all, 'cause then I just... all I... all I think about is drinking. We'll see, I mean, I'm trying to give this a whirl, just being calm, but I don't drink at home or anything like that. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: I... ya, ya. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, these are sharp, so when you hit your head against this, it scares KoKo, okay? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I scared you, Pusci. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love this little girl. &gt;&gt; DURRANI: Hi. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Sorry, I'm losing my voice. &gt;&gt; DURRANI: I missed you so much. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I missed you, too. How are you? We're having major problems with our sales today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to a basketball game and I haven't been since Lamar and I'm, like, really scared to go. &gt;&gt; ROYA: No, you look so hot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I'm not really into these shoes with this. My hair is tight. I don't want my hair tight. &gt;&gt; ROYA: Just breathe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See, Malika, I shouldn't go to a basketball game with you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Do one of you guys know how to read Arabic? You do, right? &gt;&gt; DURRANI: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I posted something on Instagram. It was for Halloween. Scott was a sheik. &gt;&gt; DURRANI: Oh, I remember. You were a kitty cat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A cat. Thank you. I wrote "Sheik pussy." But is that offensive? &gt;&gt; DURRANI: To me, personally, no. And I don't think it's the caption. I think it's 'cause you were covered... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, so it wasn't what I said-- it was how we looked. &gt;&gt; DURRANI: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Wait, but I thought they were mad at the caption. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, that's what I'm assuming... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I thought they were mad at, like, everything. &gt;&gt; NAZY: I don't think that... the whole cover thing was an issue. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay... &gt;&gt; NAZY: Like, I think just, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think... Are you more offended by my words? &gt;&gt; NAZY: I think the more... what's more, like, upsetting is the fact that... just the words, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To put the words together. &gt;&gt; NAZY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: After talking with Nazy and Durrani, I'm really upset that I've offended anybody. I'm even more bothered that a lot of the commenters are thinking that I'm poking fun of their culture. Well, I just didn't realize how offensive it was. I was, like... I did not think I did anything wrong. And I don't want to offend anyone. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: If you had known, you wouldn't have done it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really have to just be more aware of what I write, even if I think it's tongue-in-cheek, and I have to be more sensitive to that. I'm so sorry for anybody that I offended. That was the last thing I ever wanted to do. Hey, everyone, what's the vote-vote? &gt;&gt; NAZY: First outfit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who wants the red jacket? &gt;&gt; DURRANI: I think that both of 'em look good, so whatever you're comfortable in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just feel like I'm a little bright in red, and I would rather not show my butt, either. &gt;&gt; DURRANI: Why? If I had your butt, oh, my God, I'd paint it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A little just large and in charge. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, Teflon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, I like Teflon. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that coming off? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not coming off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, it's really bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I forgot how much I missed you coming over. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, are you serious? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to be in your video game. &gt;&gt; KIM: I got it. You're not gonna be in it. It's ridiculous for you to just not do that for me as a favor 'cause I've done so much for you. And for Scott to call me and say, "You should buy her a pair of shoes to put..." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't need a pair of shoes. I can buy my own shoes. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I'm like, "Buy her a pair of shoes? All theI've done for her?" I said to Scott, "I'm not buying her apair of shoes. I bought her acareer." Kourtney should do this for me as a favor, but she's like, "I don't need a video game character. What will this do for me?" Sometimes it's not about what it will do for you. I mean, the game is supposed to mirror my real life, so I think it's fun to include all my family in that. I don't know why she's being so stubborn. It's just lame to not do me a favor. Like, I bend over backwards and do business deals for the benefit of you guys when I've had my own deals. And I'm not gonna be bending over backwards if I feel like people aren't gonna do me favors. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You never asked as a favor. Never once. So if you presented it as a favor and said, "Do you want to do me a favor and will you guys please do this for me?" &gt;&gt; KIM: I have asked. I have asked. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did she ask like that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You didn't. We were in our Kardashian Kids meeting. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so lame that, like, everyone else wants to be in it. The only reason you didn't is if I didn't pay you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want the money. I don't have to do anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you're contradicting yourself because before you said you just wanted to be paid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't care to do random things. &gt;&gt; KIM: You-you don't have to do one thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I don't care to do more than I'm doing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, you're too overexposed? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to be in it. &gt;&gt; KIM: We all do each other family favors. That's just what we do. That's who we are. So I just think of your character, it's pretty &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're, like, such a joke. People want different things in life. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I'm worried about Mom a little bit. I'll look online, and there'll be all these pictures of her and Corey. She doesn't listen to me when I'm like, "You know, you should really take it slow." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Didn't you get married both times, after a couple months? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you being so difficult? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, maybe you can tell her what would make you happy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You never asked as a favor. I have to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KIM: Australia, Dubai, and India. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You travel too much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think we all do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we all do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't. I try, but I usually am told I can't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're usually told you can't do anything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. I w... I was gonna go to Israel to see the motherland. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you trying to run away? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I wasn't gonna go live in Israel. Get back there, "My people, I've come!" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if you got there and you fell in love? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wouldn't come home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, I just feel like I'm worried about Mom a little bit 'cause I'll look online and there'll be, like, all these pictures of her and Corey. Just... she doesn't listen to me when I'm like, "You know, you should really take it slow." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Didn't you get married both times after a couple months? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's something a little awkward happening. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I heard he's ghost riding her whips around town. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ugh, the thought of it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, by the way, not only once in a night-- he goes for double-decker sometimes. Kim told me he went in for seconds. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all, it's disgusting. I don't need to hear the noises that... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She lives underneath them! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And she tells me about the squeaking and whatever. That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And he comes back for seconds, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Boom. And the bed, like, bangs up against the wall. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I, like, was literally trying to pass out, and I, like, woke up and I swear I thought I heard moaning and I'm like, "Please go to bed!" Like, I put the covers over my head. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's disgusting. I have the worst visual. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom has been out of the dating game for decades, so I want her to have fun again, to meet someone, and... I just hope that my mom really thinks things through because I just don't want her to rush into anything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Out of all the people in the world, though, how does your mom decide to date a 32-year-old guy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's younger than Kim and Kourtney. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's my age, pretty much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's creepy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, doll. Welcome to my studio. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just Kylie's world, and I'm living in it. I asked her to set up her studio for a YouTube channel. She took over my entire office, so I'm slowly being... &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, this lighting is amazing though. I need this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I read you a little letter that I received via registered mail today? To you. &gt;&gt; KIM: To me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: "This is a cease and desist for the Kim Kardashian West video game." &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: "This cease and desist order is to inform you that your persistent actions, including but not limited to asking me to sign over the rights for you to use my likeness, have become unbearable. You are ordered to stop such activities immediately, as they are being done in violation of the law." &gt;&gt; KIM: Who is that from? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney Kardashian. "I have the right to remain free from these activities..." &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. Stop. Is this a joke? &gt;&gt; KRIS: "...and I do not give you any rights. I will pursue any legal remedies available..." Your sister is serious. &gt;&gt; KIM: How do I work this thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this a joke that you're-you're sending me... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...a cease-and-desist letter? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just protecting myself. Now you know what it's like to get some legal paperwork. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you being so difficult? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like Obama has a character, and Kourtney Kardashian is being difficult? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, maybe you can tell her what would make you happy, honey. Looking at it from both sides, I feel like you should... &gt;&gt; KIM: They... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...definitely offer her compensation to be in your game because she is a public... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not what it's about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, tell us what it's about. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You never asked as a favor, never once. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I feel like she... what she's saying to you is she doesn't like your approach. Why don't we do this? Why don't you decide, Kourtney, if you would agree to be in her game, and how you would want your character to be presented? Give a little thought to that, quickly... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so over this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...so that we can make sure that you are-are... &gt;&gt; KIM: What's wrong with her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm trying to pick a Jack Skellington cake, so I have to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... Oh. have to go. She's trying to hang up on us? No. She sent the letter, we hang up on her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you should have a little chat with Kourtney, because she is going to have a baby very soon, and she's probably got raging hormones and very emotional. You can talk to her and be a little kinder, more sensitive to what she's going through, and voila-- life is beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're actually kind of cute together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're going to the wedding with Corey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Doesn't that send mixed signals? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am... I think I know what I'm doing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just tell me it's not your boyfriend, but you're with him all the time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't really care what anybody else thinks anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? Kourt? Ooh, what did she make? Sugar cookies? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. Are you ignoring me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: I came over to... basically tell you that I spoke to my video game people, and we... You know, I have a fee for you, and I know it's not about the fee. I get what it's about. Like, I should have, like, asked and not assumed. My mom was right. Maybe I didn't have the best approach with Kourtney. I mean, she's hormonal and all. So, hopefully, this approach will work better. I would really like you to do it for me, as a favor. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I know you're not into being in a video game, but I really... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, you did make my career. Nobody... &gt;&gt; KIM: Without everyone, we wouldn't be here. That's why it works. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause we're all here together. Of course if you guys had a project you were really passionate about and excited about, we would all, like, help. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I appreciate the apology, and I'm happy to do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. I'll get your check over ASAP. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not about the check. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's actually not. &gt;&gt; KIM: Come on, it is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, well, well, you're... &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you wearing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you wearing, first of all? All you do is wear whole clothes with a... &gt;&gt; KIM: Looks like a gown. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's actually a robe, you dumb, so get over yourself. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're so pleasant. I'm so glad I came over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He wants me to help him pick out a pair of shoes. &gt;&gt; KIM: The velvet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're cute, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Corey wants you to pick out a pair of shoes? Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because we're going to a wedding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who is? &gt;&gt; KIM: Whose wedding? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Lance Bass. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're going to the Corey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Doesn't that send mixed signals? Someone you're not dating? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, it's a date to a wedding. I'm not getting married. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't bring someone to a wedding if you're really not serious with them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I-I think I know what I'm doing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just tell me it's not your boyfriend, but you're with him all the time. I don't care if it is. Just take ownership. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I cannot do anything right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You got that hickey right, though. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not a hickey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Apparently, it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know the rules of dating. Maybe somebody should fill me in and tell me, like, what you're supposed to do. I haven't dated anybody in 25 years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, you said he's not your boyfriend, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't really care what anybody else thinks anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want to be happy.... and do my thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And have people leave me alone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you, boo. Do... you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's kind of hard to do you when everyone's a critic... and telling me how to do me. It's so annoying that my own family is being so judgmental, because all I really want to do is live my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't do anything without getting criticized. It's-it's uncomfortable. It's like everybody wants answers, everybody wants to know what the title is. It's like you're a bunch of haters. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel really bad that my mom feels unsupported by all of her kids. I mean, the truth is, I think we're all really protective of her. I think at the end of the day, we all want her to be happy, and if she is, then we're happy for her. Mom, we're not hating on you. We just want you to be happy and have fun. Well, how would you do you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. I'm just getting my sea legs. I don't know how to do me. I'm figuring it out one day at a time. &gt;&gt; KIM: We just want you to be happy... and have fun. Life is about having fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're in Vegas, and I'm really excited. Getting back out there in the dating world is going to be very interesting, and hopefully, a lot of fun. &gt;&gt; COREY: How y'all doin'? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, baby. Mwah! How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. Khloe, pull that down. There's a lot of shadows going on there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A lot of shadows? Myis coming out. That's the shadow you see. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, who remembers the night I was doing the keg upside down? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh, yes! &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, and somebody talked me into standing on my head... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and sucking down beers hard as I could. Theyou guys make me do. You guys didn't know I was so limber, did you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom really does seem so happy, and she's smiling from ear to ear. She really can't worry about what everybody has to say, 'cause people are always going to have an opinion. And just like, everybody has one. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're actually kind of cute together. &gt;&gt; COREY: I'm a lucky &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ultimately, I'm just happy if my mom's happy, and based off of tonight and seeing how my mom is dancing and just, like, getting her groove on, I am happy for her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tip your head over like... Are you watching? Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KIM: That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good as new. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Do you have a will or a trust? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Actually, I just changed it. When Bruce and I got divorced, I decided Kourtney was going to be the executor of my will. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm the only one here. She's not here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think you should be the one that would decide, if something went wrong. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott is so shady. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know there's a big truck out front unloading a car? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A car? What is happening? My mom and Khloe keep questioning me about what you're doing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't say like that.
