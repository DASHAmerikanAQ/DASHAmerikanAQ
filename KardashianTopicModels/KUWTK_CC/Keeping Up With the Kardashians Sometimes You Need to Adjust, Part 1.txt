- &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Mase, is this yours? &gt;&gt; KIM: Can Kiki have it? &gt;&gt; MASON: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: You want Kiki to take you to the candy store? &gt;&gt; MASON: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I wanted to tell you guys, um... &gt;&gt; MASON: Nikki have colors. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I just came from Mom's house. Did you guys hear about Lamar? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but I didn't hear all the details. &gt;&gt; KIM: He got released from the Dallas Mavericks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's insane. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lamar got released from the Dallas Mavericks. &gt;&gt; MAN: The Mavericks and Lamar Odom have parted ways. He's heading back to Los Angeles and will remain inactive for the rest of the year. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's coming back to L.A., right, Jeff? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Yeah. He wants to make this a basketball decision, he doesn't want to make excuses for anything that happened with the Mavericks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lamar not playing for Dallas is a mutual decision, but he still isn't playing basketball, which is his number one passion. I mean, I think, like, contractually he's still a Dallas Maverick, so he can't go to any other team. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: They come home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm excited that Khloe's coming home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hopefully, Khloe will be back to normal. Maybe she'll be, like, fun, crazy Khloe again. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She has been pretty down. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's just been moody. &gt;&gt; KIM: She'll at least feel like she's back to herself a little bit because, like, she's not overcompensating for Lamar being in a new environment and trying to make him feel comfortable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe has definitely been a little different since she's been in Dallas. I feel like I never talk to her anymore. I hope that when she does come back to L.A., that she can get back into her groove and become the Khloe that I'm obsessed with. What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you worried about having a girl that it's gonna be so different than a boy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just got to, you know, deal with what happens. &gt;&gt; KIM: A father-and-son relationship is way different than, like, a daughter-and-father relationship. &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm making a funny face. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me see that. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are? Let me see. Can you do this? That was a good one. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're funny. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Wait. Can I take a picture? &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it Thong Thursday? &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KIM: Or Titty Tuesday? &gt;&gt; ROB: Let's stop the Twitter reference. Don't worry, Bruce. You're not gonna be in it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to put it somewhere. &gt;&gt; KIM: But why? It's disgusting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're not walking around with a swollen bowling ball in your bag. You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have to go to Kylie's recital. All right, I'll see you guys later. &gt;&gt; ROB: See ya. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, Bruce. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think I'm gonna come with you guys to the club tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KIM: You should. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys believe that I got an offer to do an appearance at a Sweet 16 for a little girl's birthday? &gt;&gt; KIM: To do what, perform? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going there to say "happy birthday" on the loudspeaker, present her cake and be there with her and her friends. &gt;&gt; KIM: We all know Scott could get really inappropriate. &gt;&gt; GIRL: That was so scary! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's, like, no beer in here. &gt;&gt; ROB: He's kidding. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You cannot do that in public. A little discretion goes a long way. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I just hope that he really can keep himself together and just be normal at a Sweet 16. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Walking around... &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you sure you're appropriate for a Sweet 16? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No! I definitely don't think so, but they're paying me, so I'm not gonna pass it up. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Bruiser. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's going on with you? &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott got a offer to do some little girl's Sweet 16. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What type of parents would do that? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know, but he wants me to go with him, and Mom especially wants me to go with him 'cause... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's afraid? &gt;&gt; ROB: She's very afraid. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why would you ever invite...? I mean, I can see you maybe. You're kind of cute and adorable. That's absolutely ridiculous. It's not easy. &gt;&gt; ROB: It isn't easy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. It's been tough with Kendall and Kylie lately. They've been busy as heck working. You know, before, I'd do the carpool every morning, you know? I was with 'em. Now they're gone all the time. Every time I turn around. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's a good thing, though. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know if it's really a good thing. I miss my little girls. Do you know we were so much closer before. And now all of a sudden it's like I barely know 'em anymore. I've been raising kids for 33 years. A lot of kids, a lot of things have happened. I think it's the toughest with the last two, Kendall and Kylie. Maybe I should make a new rule: every Saturday we should go hit balls. Should I set that up? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, thanks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think, like, a spider brooch. You know, that you can wear. With little diamonds on it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I got one of those. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think it's time I leave. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's it? We're just coming up with ideas, and you guys are leaving? What is Chef Kylie cooking? Now you're not talking? Can anybody have a conversation in here or what? They're driving, I don't see 'em as much. They don't talk to me as much. And that's tough on a dad. You know, carpool at least I was with them every day and talked to them every day and this and that. And now Kendall's, like, you know, got the car. She drives Kylie. They don't want to talk to me anymore. If I get close, they take their BlackBerrys and they turn 'em away. They shut their computer when I get close. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's some things that you're not supposed to know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want to know everything. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, kid. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ah! [Bleep], that hurt. &gt;&gt; ROB: Did it really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I had 'em dangling there. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. That's hilarious. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone, I'm home! &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe's here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am back in L.A. and I am trying to coordinate our move back from Dallas. So a little bit of a whirlwind. But you know what? In my family, I feel like whirlwinds happen all the time. Who's this? &gt;&gt; MASON: Kendall. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. Who's this? That's Mommy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Welcome home! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my goodness! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! Everybody clap for Khloe! She's home! &gt;&gt; ALL: Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We love you so much. For the past few months there's been a big hole in my family because Khloe and Lamar haven't been here. They've missed Christmas, they've missed Easter, They've missed big family celebrations and birthdays and parties and get-togethers. And it feels empty here without them in Los Angeles. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's the deal with... on Lamar? Is he in town or what's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, he had a late exit meeting with some teammates. He gets back tomorrow around 10:00. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How does it feel to be back at home? Do you feel excited? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't even know. Like, right now I have so much to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's big grand opening of his restaurant is happening in New York. Scott thinks that we don't treat him as part of the family. I want everybody to come to New York to show him that we do care and support the things that he's doing. I feel like it would mean a lot for him whoever can come. I know Rob's gonna be there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It'd be really nice if Khloe could come, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're all gonna be there. Khloe, YOLO: "You Only Live Once." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I literally just got back to L.A., and I'm now being asked to go to New York for Scott's restaurant opening. But what my family doesn't really get is, like, I am going through a million different emotions in my head, and kind of the last thing I should be doing is leaving L.A. again right now. I'm not even out of Dallas yet. Khloe, you have to put a reservation or something on hold so you don't try to come at the last minute and there's not even a flight. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I know Khloe's really stressed out just coming home from Dallas. I completely understand putting your husband first, but I think Khloe takes it to a different extreme. And the whole family's going to New York, and we would love her there with us. And I feel like she should be there with us. But maybe she's just a little too stressed. 177 00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,889 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Will you try to come? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm gonna try to come. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: "Check out his mom 20 years ago." Hey, come here! &gt;&gt; ROB: This is exactly why he should not be hosting some Sweet 16. The dad of this 16-year-old's gonna throw you out of the party when he realizes he hired a pervert. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't pass judgment on me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you gonna come to New York? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What have I told you? &gt;&gt; KIM: You just say you don't know yet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like Khloe's having all these excuses that aren't real. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are just such haters. I am an Odom. Bye, Kardashians. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm pretty excited to be in New York with you, Bobby. I feel like we haven't had a boys' New York trip, city trip, in a long time. You feel me? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yeah, I feel you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Now that we're in New York City, I'm excited. I'm from here, so it's always nice to be back, and there's always a great vibe here. What do you want to do tonight? All right, let's go to dinner, and then we'll go out and pop some bottles. What up, honey? Her name is Ashna, correct? I mean, so what do I have to really do at the Sweet 16? &gt;&gt; MAN: You'll dance with her. She probably will run away from you 'cause she'd be, you know, shy. Just hang out with them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. I'm excited. I'll see you in a little bit. I'm flattered I'm in with the teen crowd. I mean, I know Kendall and Kylie like me a lot, and I don't consider myself one of those sagas, but I guess, I got some kind of following in the teen community, so why not? All right, so I'll meet you in the lobby. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. Text me before you bounce. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, chips. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Chops. Hit me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Enjoy your lunch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE AND KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott's excited about... soup, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. That'll be exciting. I can't believe that he's actually seeing this whole thing through from beginning to end. That's what's exciting to see him, like, create a business on his own. It's like when you guys first opened your very first Dash store, that's what it's like. This is a big, big deal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. My mom just can't help herself. Dropping all these hints. They're not subtle though. I first need to talk to Lamar about it because we're only in L.A. for a day, are you okay? Now trucking to New York for a little bit. This move from Dallas, like, I'm so tired. Lam. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hey. I'm okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Mwah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mmm... I'm happy you're home. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Are you? You look stunning today, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, man, look at this guy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Big man. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's up? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nice to be home? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't know. My feelings were mixed. So many people are saying so many crazy, crazy, crazy... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But why do you listen to that? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm not gonna say it doesn't bother me. They say what doesn't kill you will make you stronger. I must be a strong &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, fella, you gotta be honest. Your whole life is totally consumed by this, you know? Every time you raise the bar in life, it takes a greater commitment. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My goal in 1975, the year before the Games, was to break the world record, be the first guy over 8,500 points. I trained my ass off. I get to my first meet, scored 8,250 points. I worked an entire year and I just got back up to the same level I was the year before. Maybe that's as good as I could be. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The next half hour, I sat there just crying my eyes out, devastated. And I'm there with my good buddy Vince, he goes, "Bruce, is winning the Games the most important thing in your life?" You train six to eight hours a day. The food you eat-- the food you.... is to get stronger. Okay, at night, when you're at home, you keep a hurdle in your living room, and you do slow-motion exercise at night and stretching exercises. You really can't say, no it isn't the most important thing in your life, 'cause your total life is consumed by this. Obviously, it is, but what if you lose? Do you die? It means life over? I mean, how bad does that hurt? I had to say to myself-- I have to have enough confidence in myself as a human being that I could overcome failure. May take me a day to recover, may take me a week to recover, might take me ten years of my life to recover from failure... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Huge problem for me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...but you know what, I will survive failure. And then went to the Games six weeks later, won the Games, I 271 00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,596 broke the world record for a third time. The whole athletic thing is very difficult. There's winning, there's losing. Great lessons in life to learn but, you know, sharing some of the stories that I had back when I was competing-- some of the not-so-good days-- I think it's important to share with Lamar: You need to go through these things so you really appreciate the good times. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know if we don't let you talk, but that was a very good story. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I loved that. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's a test 'cause now I gotta just use my time wisely and get back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The good news is now you gotta play golf with me. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Now we gotta play golf. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My tire's flat. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No way. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So do you think you can... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I wonder how that happened. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Probably from parking at school in the dirt. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let me see. Oh, yeah, it is low. The car is tilting a little bit. Want me to drive you somewhere? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. Can we just fix it so it doesn't ruin my rims? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll drive ya. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, Dad, it's fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know it's small putting a little air back in a tire, but it was kind of nice to be able to spend a some time with the girls and teach them them a few things. I mean, I'm a dad. That's what I was supposed to do. Are you ready? We got power, babe. Go down there. You gotta get it so it's straight on. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is it doing it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yep, it's going in. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am surprised that my dad could just take his little air pumper thing out and pump up my tire, 'cause now I don't have to take it to the shop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Where are you guys going? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: The mall. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To the mall? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks, Dad. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You sure you don't need me to drive you? 309 00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:27,900 &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, it's okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are we going to do with all this? &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: So I took out one box of dry cleaning that we can hang. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So this is all cleaned. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: This is clean. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then anything that says like "Dallas Mavs" on it, let's put aside, and I'll see if he wants to keep it or not. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What I really need to happen, he wants to do, like, still stay on his workouts, like, right away. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I need to have Robbie Davis booked. I have so many things to unpack, and Lamar wants to continue training every day, which I have to arrange that and make sure that he's in tip-top shape. Like Bruce said, he has to get his mental game back, and Lamar's really determined to do so. And then we have to get all of our furniture and stuff from Dallas into the storage out here. &gt;&gt; ROB: How's it going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? It's great to be back in New York. We're going to go out to dinner. So I invited Chris and Tom. And I'm excited that Rob gets to see some of my old friends. Maybe we'll get into a little trouble. It's good to see you, bro. &gt;&gt; ROB: Cheers. Cheers, Tom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You cheers dot-com, baby. Would you take a picture with her for Twitter? And I'll say, check out his mom 20 years ago. It's hysterical. Looks just like Kris Jenner. Hey, come here! &gt;&gt; ROB: No, no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wow. That's cute. I'll send it to your mom. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: All right, guys. I hope your mother likes it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Same haircut. Hey, you all know that Scott is hosting a Sweet 16 tomorrow, right? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I'm still sipping mai tais in the middle of tatas. &gt;&gt; ROB: Do you realize that the dad of this little 16-year-old is gonna throw you out of the party when he realizes he's hired arabid little pervert? Scott's like in full-blown denial. He has no clue how disrespectful he can be, and that just worries me that he's hosting a 16-year-old's party. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't pass judgment on me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where's my car? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Karen didn't tell you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I told her to take it down to get the tire checked out. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I have to be somewhere right now, Dad. It's frustrating knowing that I'm not gonna have my car for a few days. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But in the meantime, let's just enjoy each other's company. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's all have dinner. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar's gonna be now training every single day. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was so looking forward to getting Khloe back, and it's just not like that. We just never see you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm upstairs in the bedroom. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where's my car? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Karen didn't tell you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I told her to take it down to Hank's Tire. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, to get the tire checked out and to rotate the tires because you probably haven't had them rotated. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why didn't tell me? I have to be somewhere right now, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll drive you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. That's annoying. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just like the old days. Love it! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think it's weird that my dad put my car in the shop without even asking me. And it's frustrating knowing that I'm not gonna have my car for a few days. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's kind of just like the old days, remember? I can remember carpooling you kids to preschool. I mean, I've done it all your life. The carpool action. "Man, how's it going in school?" That's what we used to talk about all the time. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And we would say, "Good" every time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Isn't your prom coming up? You gonna get asked? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Most likely not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? If I was in high school, I would've asked you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's weird, 'cause you're my dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm-I'm saying I wouldn't be your father, I would be like in high school. You'd go with me in a heartbeat. I was like the big jock star. I was Most Valuable Player in football, Most Valuable Player in basketball. You would've gone, "Oooh! Look at that guy!" &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're into yourself. Um, so how long is my car gonna be in the shop, exactly? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Exactly? It shouldn't be too long. But in the meantime, let's just enjoy each other's company. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so happy you are home. I got you a present. I think it's so cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you! Oh. Mighty heavy. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Khloe, none of us have even seen Lamar yet. Let's all have dinner. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think that an ambush of people. I just think he needs to lay low. &gt;&gt; KIM: An ambush? We're his family. We just want to say, "Welcome home." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my... I mean, I don't mean it in a negative way. I just think, like, there's so much going on, like, just let him get into his house and, like, digest what's going on. When Lamar and I made the move back from Dallas to L.A., one of our biggest discussions was continuing having a workout routine, because I want Lamar just to focus on training, and that's where his head is at, and I want his head to stay there. Lamar's gonna be now training every single day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Okay." &gt;&gt; KIM: We just never see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't had time to even think. I'm, like, exhausted. So, I've gots to go. Don't give me no, young lady. Caress in my breasts. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But... &gt;&gt; KIM: Remember, as a kid, we would, like, stand on Dad like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think your ass is too big for this now. &gt;&gt; KIM: He'd try and walk, and we'd be like, "Don't go!" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I literally can't lift you up. Does that feel good on your vagina? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. You're like a little Chihuahua, humping my leg. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, that smells so bad. Why would you have to fart like that? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Because... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, Lamar! &gt;&gt; ROBBIE: What a jerk. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's better, um, out than in. &gt;&gt; ROBBIE: One mile in, one mile out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; ROBBIE: Good luck. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I love California. &gt;&gt; ROBBIE: There's a lot of open land out here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just being back in L.A., Lamar is so motivated, and he's been training about six hours a day, getting his body in shape, making sure he stays in shape, and I love to join in on the workouts. I like being, like, a support system for Lamar. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I think I might start, like, going twice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Two-a-days? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, probably just like, something light... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: And then going to find a gym, and then going to lift and shoot at night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that's good. That would be fun. 451 00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,547 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, dude! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Why? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi! &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So loud over here! Yeah, we have a noise complaint for next door. Would you guys mind keeping it down a little bit. Rob and I are on our way out to go to the Sweet 16. In the room next to us, it's like some big bachelorette party going on. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: I need the bachelorette. Meg! Where are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT:it, why not? Rob and I will make a quick appearance here before I go to my appearance, just to get warmed up for my hosting appearance, of course. All right, where's the girl? Let's do this All right? Oh! Robert, come on down. Let's do this Oh, yeah, money! &gt;&gt; ROB: We aren't even to the party yet, and Scott's on a table at this girl's bachelorette party, pretending like he's a stripper. This is exactly the type of behavior... of why he should not be hosting some little girl's Sweet 16. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Congratulations! &gt;&gt; MEG: What are you here for? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm here for your bachelorette. I was hired by your friend Jennifer. &gt;&gt; MEG: I don't have a friend Jennifer. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, congratulations. 480 00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:35,688 &gt;&gt; MEG: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bye, guys. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. How you doing? Happy birthday. &gt;&gt; ASHNA: I'm great. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's everything? &gt;&gt; ASHNA: It's really good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My brother Rob. &gt;&gt; ASHNA: Hi! &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, how are you? I'm Robert. &gt;&gt; ASHNA: How's it going? &gt;&gt; ROB: Happy birthday. &gt;&gt; ASHNA: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just learned how to write, like, for the first time, 491 00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:04,917 last week, so... just give me a minute. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're here at Ashna's party. The DJ's playing great music. Seems like everybody's enjoying me being here. But then again, who wouldn't? I'm about to get this party poppin'. 13? How do you like being in a nightclub? You've got a couple years until you're allowed. Yo, yo, chill, bro. Shut up. All right, what do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; ROB: Just give me a code word. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Red eagle. &gt;&gt; ROB: "Red eagle"? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob felt that it was extremely necessary to come up with a code name, and any time he says it, I need to check myself and realize that I was about to do something a little outlandish. Oh, they're trying to get their drink on, these kids? &gt;&gt; ASHNA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Red eagle. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I get it. I think it's a bit over the top, but Rob thinks that it's a must. Oh, pow! &gt;&gt; ROB: Red eagle. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my. &gt;&gt; ROB: Red... eagle. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Eagle. &gt;&gt; ROB: So literally we've only been here for ten minutes, and Scott's already just doing all kinds of inappropriate things. SCOTT: Ah-hey! &gt;&gt; ROB: Scotty! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't believe they

- - &gt;&gt; ROB: Red eagle. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ♫ Happy birthday Happy birthday... ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad? When's my car supposed to be ready? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They said it would be ready in a day or so. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Really? 'Cause I just called them. It was ready about two days ago. &gt;&gt; KIM: You should come to New York. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will talk to Lamar and see what I could do. &gt;&gt; KIM: It seems like Khloe is just trying to make Lamar's world so perfect. So that just makes me frustrated. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's a lot of pressure on me right now. I can't commit to going. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Even though Scott's chilled out a bit, I still feel like I do need to, like, watch out for him, so he doesn't look like a... like some weirdo at a Sweet 16. &gt;&gt; AMIR: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; AMIR: That's my other one. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Really? &gt;&gt; AMIR: Yeah, Ariya. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you? &gt;&gt; ARIYA: Good. &gt;&gt; AMIR: She's a fashion designer. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. Give me a hug? &gt;&gt; AMIR: She made this dress. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh, you made that? &gt;&gt; ARIYA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hi, how are you? Robert. &gt;&gt; AMIR: That's Rob, remember? Yeah, absolutely. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wow. How old are you? You look fantastic. &gt;&gt; ARIYA: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, now that I'm having a daughter... &gt;&gt; AMIR: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...it's like starting to really click in my mind that, you know, when you're a parent, you will go above and beyond and do anything you can in your power to do something for them no matter what, if they want it. And I think little girls even more so than little boys. &gt;&gt; AMIR: Right, absolutely. Like, they're so dear to my heart. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; AMIR: And I'm-I'm sure you're going to have that same relationship with your daughter. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm excited. &gt;&gt; MAN: Ashna's mom has a special speech for her. &gt;&gt; ASHNA'S MOM: We've been so blessed to have you as our daughter. My little baby is becoming a young lady. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I am pretty positive that when my daughter arrives in this world, I will do anything to make her happy. I think there's a lot of things that I need to change about myself to make me a great father, especially to a daughter, and I want to start working on those things now. &gt;&gt; ROB: Listen, you did a great job tonight. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You trying to kiss me? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, no, I'm telling you you did a great job tonight. You look like a respectable father, you sick &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Aren't you guys getting any yogurt? Are you just doing the samplers? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Just the samplers. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Any boys hanging out or... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's a good thing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Have you heard anything about my car? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I haven't actually. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I think they got to do some service on it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can I get like, a rental or something? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rental? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Something, you're not letting me drive any of the cars at home. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can drive you. You don't need to drive a car. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like I shouldn't be driving with you, and I don't even have my license. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So, you're punishing both of us, basically. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Am I really punishing both of you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes, so why can't I get a rental car? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I-I don't... We're not gonna spend money on a rental car. I'll call the guys. I'll call them. All right, I'm done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at my pretty pool lights. I love being home. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to give you ten reasons why you should come to New York. so much. Number two, it's been so long since all of us have been together... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...in one place. Number three, I know you miss Mason. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Word. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott is opening something; I feel like he never feels like he's a part of the family. And we can all go and support him and make him feel really... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are getting close. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm hormonal, so you could be there, and I'm claustrophobic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How does claustrophobia have to do with me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need support of my family in this time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh... Okay, so one more. One more, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We missed you in Dallas. You were gone for so long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ten. Okay, you guys know I love you guys, too. You also have to know that I literally just got back in town, and I love the ten reasons for why I should go, and I agree with some of those reasons, but I'm just saying there's a lot of pressure on me right now. I don't want to bite off more than I can chew and feel overwhelmed. I can't commit to going, but it's definitely in my brain. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like Khloe's having all these excuses that aren't real, and she doesn't have, you know, Lamar's basketball schedule as an excuse anymore, and she can unpack at any time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm definitely gonna try to work things out. I'll talk to Lamar and see what I could do, but at the moment, right this second, I can't say, "Sure, I'm gonna be on the 12:00 flight." 620 00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:28,193 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just feel good knowing that you're a hot commodity. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Anna... just texted me, asking if we wanted to go to the mall. So, I don't think we can go. 'Cause I don't want to like, ask Dad to take us, and like... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Where's your car, by the way? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Honestly, I don't know why it's taking this long. Dad told me... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's been, what, five days? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't even know how long. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom would be like, "I need the car this time like, tomorrow." And Dad's not like that. He's just really laid back, and like, won't care. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There wasn't anything wrong with your car. You should have it. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hello. Hank's Auto Body. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm calling to check on my car. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, what's the name? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Jenner. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, let me check. Yep, it's ready. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It is? When was it done? &gt;&gt; MAN: Uh... Done two days ago. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My car's been ready for two days. I am so confused. I don't know why my dad is making up these excuses. That's awful. Why wouldn't Dad tell me? Should we go talk to him? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I'll come with you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, um, when's my car supposed to be ready? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They said it would be ready, you know, in a day or so. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause I just called them, and they said that it was ready about two days ago, and that they called you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You actually called them? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I wanted to know where my car was. 'Cause you just lied to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My family just thinks, like, I'm sitting here laying out every day, and I just feel like I'm about to break and crumble. People don't get like, how muchI'm put under. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You said it would be ready in a day, but it was ready two days ago. You just lied to me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, here's the deal. For 33 years, I carpooled kids every day. I kind of miss that. I miss carpooling you guys. You guys are out running around. You got your car, independent. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's why you took my car away? That's awful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't take it away, I just wasn't in a big rush to get it back. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, I need my car to go places. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do you know how many things we could have done in these past two days? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I missed you guys. I don't see you as much as I used to see you. I don't mind driving you around. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You don't have to like, take my car away to hang out with us. Like, you can ask us to hang out; you just never ask. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But I ask all the time. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, you don't. You asked to go to the movies... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I say, do you want to go to a movie? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, Dad, movies are different. Movies are like, boring, and you just sit there and you watch and sometimes there's no good movies out. You could ask us to go anywhere else, and we'll probably want to go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just don't feel like you guys really need me anymore. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, of course we need you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I need you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, you're laughing about it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, it was just so sad the way you said it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I need you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I know. It is sad. I mean, it's just like you're all growing up, and I've had enough kids grow up, and you know, you're my ninth child and my tenth child. You know, it's like I've been doing this all my life. But anyway... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad, I'll always be your child. Even though Kendall and I are teenagers, and we kind of want to do our own thing sometimes, it doesn't mean that we love our dad any less. I think we will definitely try and spend more time with him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, you gonna get your car? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Will you drive me there? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll drive you to go get your car. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You guys give me a hug. Okay? Oh, it's so sad! Okay, let's get your car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to read this? This is about suited and booted Kendre. I could get you more info. That's bullet points. This is my only copy. Do you want to read that and go over it, or do you want me to analyze it more? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'll read it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'll get it right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Jeff Schwartz, what's the strategy? &gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: The strategy is I want him in the gym as much as he wants. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, no, and I totally get that. Let's... working out. We're getting in shape. Okay, thank you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, sorry, I was on the phone with, um, Jeff Schwartz and the lawyers and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't mean to call so many times, Khloe, but I'm just trying to like, make plans with you. All I want to do is go out and have some dinner, have you guys over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, but, Mom, and I love you, and I appreciate that, but there's so much that I have to do and get my house back together and move back from Dallas and unpack everything, and it's just a lot. Kourtney's e-mailing me about the new Dash store. I'm like-- I would love to come and see you, but I just need to get into the flow of being back here, basically. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, if there's anything I can do. I guess I won't talk to you about New York right now, but I really miss you, Khloe, and I'm craving a little Khloe, and, you know, I need some Khloe time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what, I need some Khloe time, 'cause right now, I don't have it, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a mother in need. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Go to your husband. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just like, I'm sure you heard the phone going off the hook. My mom has called at least 30 times while I was trying to deal with Lamar and his training stuff. Jeff Schwartz is like, you know, going crazy and blah, blah, blah. It's too much. I'm still unloading boxes from Dallas. I have to get my house and everything else in order. I mean, I just feel like my, like, family just thinks, like, I'm sitting here, like, laying out every day and, like, doing workouts and, like, going to spas. Like, they're... I don't know what they think, and I just feel like I'm about to break and crumble, and it's just really stressful, and I get migraines every day, and people... Like, just people don't get like, how muchI'm put under. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's okay. Don't worry so much about what people think. They're your family, but they're gonna love you regardless. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But they don't get, like, it's, like, they don't back off. My family has been pressuring me and pulling me in a million different directions. I've only been in L.A. for three or four days, and right now it's, like, really taking its toll on me. I feel like I'm being, like, judged, like, "Well, why can't you come to dinner tonight?" I have not had a vacation. I'm not saying I want one. I would like just to be in my house and not have something to do. I love my life. I'm not complaining about that. But anybody else in my family, people respect that they're busy. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's, like, why can't you guys respect that I have so many other things that are bigger? Like, they don't get it. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You're not a little girl, but you're still their little sister. And no matter what... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I take care of all of them! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's true, and they need you now just like Lamar needs you and your businesses needs you and your home needs you. Like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I take care of my businesses and my home and I take care of my husband. And I love my family and I want to spend time with my family, but I can't hold everybody's hand every step of the way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you gonna come to New York? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What have I told you? &gt;&gt; KIM: You just say you don't know yet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You just have every excuse not to come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why the hell are you guys pressuring me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you still not know yet or do you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like,off! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: What's all this? &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Egg salad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Looks delish. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So what are we gonna say to Khloe about this whole New York thing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. It's, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not really the New York thing itself. I don't know, I just feel like she always has an excuse. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, there's always an excuse. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I don't know why she feels the need. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I think Khloe feels like Lamar thinks that Khloe's all he's got 'cause he's lost everyone else in his life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but I don't even know if it's what he wants. I think it's just what she thinks she has to be for him. She has to be his everything. But I think it also puts a lot of pressure on herself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. I think she loves being with him 24/7 and loves that she's his, like, everything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But she acts like we're doing something mean by asking her to hang out with us. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so crazy. She acts like we're, like, evil. It's kind of ridic. I was so looking forward to getting Khloe back. Lamar's not playing basketball, they have all this free time. And it's just not like that. It seems like Khloe's just so stressed and just doing whatever she can trying to make Lamar's world so perfect. So that just makes me frustrated for her that she could completely have the best of both worlds. We're kind of near Khloe. Should we go over and talk to her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know this is gonna cause a big annoying fight. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, am I gonna get electrocuted? Dad? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Two of the lights in my bathroom aren't working. Can you help me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fix the lights? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: These two. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mom buys these stupid fancy lights. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, look at 'em. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Should I turn the lights off? That's not safe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're not like normal lights. I have no idea where you find a light like that with a silver top. Best I can do is, there's a light store that I know of. Maybe, you know, hey, take it there, see what they can do. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: See, Dad? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I do need you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You need me? For what? Yeah, to fix the light. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, see? Oh, I'm so wanted. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's needing you. Yeah. Going on a walk right now, you can come. We're taking the dogs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, you want me to go? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I'll go. I'll take this with me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You all ready? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. Probably the most important 836 00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:37,635 lesson I've learned in raising ten children is you gotta cherish every moment... ...'cause life moves on very quickly. Kids grow up very fast. But it's great to have those great moments. I cherish every one of them. Sit in the back seat. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I guess I'm sitting in the trunk. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, they're so annoying. 844 00:39:52,383 --> 00:39:56,587 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, sit back in the back with the dogs. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Pilates was really good today. I saw you stopped replying to the e-mail chain. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Most pregnant girls take a nap every day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You forget how it is to have a newborn. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you not have a baby nurse yet lined up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's my point. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's fine. I'll have a co-sleeper, and then he can sleep in the bed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's a co-sleeper? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It, like, attaches next to the bed with one side's open. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But when you have the baby, he's gonna want to be in your bed more. &gt;&gt; KIM: Once you have a kid, we're never gonna see Khloe. She'll be with her "family." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's fair. &gt;&gt; KIM: You've missed Christmas morning for three years in a row. When you have kids, don't you think you're gonna have to bring them there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But if Lamar's playing at an out-of-state game, I'm sorry. We're gonna have Christmas with their father. Lamar and I moved five days before Christmas to Dallas, we spent Christmas in a hotel room by ourselves. It wasn't a fun Christmas for me. They're now attacking me for not being there, like it was my choice, like I wanted to be away from them. I mean, I've done everything that I can think of possibly doing. I don't know what else I could do at this point. &gt;&gt; KIM: So if he's playing in L.A. the next year, no exceptions. 875 00:41:14,498 --> 00:41:18,903 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fine! No exceptions next year. Like,off! &gt;&gt; KIM: Lamar has been a part of the family for three years. If he's playing in L.A. the next year, no exceptions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fine! No exceptions next year. off! Listen, I try to make everyone a priority. I think you guys are a little stingy. I do, like, whatever you guys want. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this because Lamar's lost his mom and his grandmother and every female figure in his life? Do you feel like you need to replace, like, you need to be all of them? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You just put too much pressure on yourself to be everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's no pressure. This is just how I am as a person. Sorry. You two are calling me out? Kim, your system hasn't really worked. And, Kourtney, you and your boyfriend don't even sleep in the same room anymore. So I have to do what's best for me and my marriage. I'm not gonna let you guys play me to be like this person. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you are this person. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you are; you're very family oriented with the Odoms. You're officially an Odom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you gonna come to New York? Are you gonna even ask Lamar? Should we ask Lamar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you mean, am I even gonna ask Lamar? Like, what kind of comment is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You just have every excuse not to come. I just know you won't come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But how do you know that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what I'm asking: Are you coming? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What did I say the other day? What have I told you? &gt;&gt; KIM: You just say you don't know yet. You don't know yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, I don't know yet. So why the hell are you guys pressuring me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you still not know yet or do you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You asked me yesterday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, it's a new day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm not coming. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But why is that offensive to ask? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not just that, it's the harassment of everything else that you guys put me through and the pressure, the pressure, the pressure. So guess what? I am an Odom. Bye, Kardashians. Next on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and Kanye have been hanging out. &gt;&gt; ROB: We're gonna get wasted. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She rewards him for his bad behavior. I would tell him, "Hit the road, Jack." &gt;&gt; KIM: I just, like, want my sister back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Try calling her now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God.
