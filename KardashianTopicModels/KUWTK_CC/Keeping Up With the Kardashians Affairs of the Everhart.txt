Good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would have told him off; wish I was there. 20 years later? Why would she even talk to him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I was thinking about just seeing him one more time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to still be married? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Then stay far away from him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look cute. Uh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey! Ow. Okay, now the horsey's going. Oh! &gt;&gt; MASON: Here we go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, is Koko attacking you? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you wearing a dress? Is that your sister's? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's a tunic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't think that's a little girly for you? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's very cute for your sister. Yeah, take it off. I want to see your abs of steel. Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. How are you? Mwah. Oh, I missed you. The girls said they saw you. You saw Liz and... &gt;&gt; LANCE: Yeah, I did, mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome, hi. &gt;&gt; LANCE: This is Michael. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Michael, how are you? &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so glad you guys came over. Come on, you guys, I want to show you the house. I've invited one of my really good friends, Lance Bass, over for dinner tonight. Lance was a member of the boy band, NSYNC. I haven't seen him in a while, so it'll be really good to catch up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? Why are you taking a picture of that book? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause it's cool. Why are you up here though? Why aren't you downstairs with Mom? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's Mom's friend. She invited him over, and I don't think she wants me to get in the way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, Lance is here. He's downstairs. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Don't be boring and sit up here and watch golf. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And where's your pants? And I can't look at those toes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I've been working all day. I've traveled all the way across the United States. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Come on, live a little. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll wear my sandals. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, not your sandals. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll put pants on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, pants and shoes, like an adult. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can I have some? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, just share with her; there's more. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She called me fat today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall! &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: I did that to my sister all the time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tell her she looks fat? &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: She's like 85 pounds. &gt;&gt; LANCE: She's 85 pounds, and he's a twin. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, now you know exactly where those comments are coming from. Disregard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall, get off the phone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Lance, you go to college? &gt;&gt; LANCE: Not really. 'Cause when I was a junior in high school, that's when I joined NSYNC, and like, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it started in Florida, right? &gt;&gt; LANCE: Oh, yeah, Orlando. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: With that guy, what's his name, the... &gt;&gt; LANCE: Lou Pearlman. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, what happened to him? &gt;&gt; LANCE: He's still in jail. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Still in jail? Hey. &gt;&gt; LANCE: In his contract, he had a management commission, he was the president of the label, and he was officially the sixth member of NSYNC. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was he the sixth member of NSYNC? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I was gonna say, you're exactly Lou Pearlman. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Four sisters? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's already got like, two glasses of wine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't ever sit next to each other? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar and I sit next to each other. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's see 21 years from now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I feel like too much distance like, then you guys get comfortable in the too much distance. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It keeps the romance alive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What romance do you guys have? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There's nothing there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: At least we know my car doesn't fit here if you get it. &gt;&gt; ROB: So, I'm going house-hunting today. I've been searching off and on for homes for a while now, but I always go looking and then I don't find exactly something that I love, and it's just a long process, and I decided to bring dickey-boy Scott along. &gt;&gt; JOE: Hello. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, hey. &gt;&gt; JOE: I'm Joe Babajian. &gt;&gt; ROB: How are you? Robert. How you doing? &gt;&gt; JOE: Rob, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. Scott. Nice belt-- Cartier? &gt;&gt; JOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Same. &gt;&gt; JOE: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, this is unbelievable. &gt;&gt; ROB: Now, that definitely... &gt;&gt; JOE: Great entertaining. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love this room. &gt;&gt; JOE: It's not compartmentalized. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I like it already, so... &gt;&gt; JOE: Dining room here, kitchen here with laundry room. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, this is great. &gt;&gt; JOE: Master bedroom. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, nice. &gt;&gt; JOE: The magic. Right out to the pool. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, that's cool. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, dude, you could literally dip here and then dip in there right after. &gt;&gt; ROB: It really is perfect. &gt;&gt; JOE: Great patio. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, you can have a party and have girls dancing up here. &gt;&gt; JOE: That's a great idea. &gt;&gt; ROB: It is a great idea. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; JOE: Do whatever you want out here. It's totally private. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't want to jump the gun, but honestly I've been looking so much, and this is, like, perfect for me and it has just everything I really need. I'm very serious about this place, though, so what is it at? What's the price? &gt;&gt; JOE: A million-one. &gt;&gt; ROB: A million-one, and it's negotiable, you said? &gt;&gt; JOE: Yeah, there's some negotiation. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So why don't you think about it and then you'll figure out what kind of offer you want to make if you actually like it like that, right? 123 00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:15,147 Don't be hasty and try to make an offer now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. Is that Angie? How you doing? &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's Bruce. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; ANGIE: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Very good. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: You, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How have you been? Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Good. The, the L.A. hug? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The L.A. hug. Little pat on the back. That's exactly right. Angie is a former supermodel. You know, she was one of the first big supermodels back in the day, and I've met her at golf tournaments. She's a big-time golfer. Not too many women do like golf, so it's kind of a, a nice change. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I went and I played in, uh, Michael Jordan's golf tournament and I played so bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How long have you been playing? &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Since I was little. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See, I tried to get my girls into it. It's the only game you can beat the boys at. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I got-- yeah, that's true. I love beating the boys in golf. I do. The Haney Project. You were very competitive. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Does your wife play golf or...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, Kris is not a golfer, no, no. Where do you play at? &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I play wherever I get invited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh... don't have a club? &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I don't have a club I play at. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I'll have to have you out. Maybe you can teach me something. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I'm good for fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, good. I should get your number and I'll give you a call and we'll play. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I would love that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm looking forward to playing golf with Angie. I think it's going to be a lot of fun. She's a good golfer, she knows the game. Plus, she's a lot better to look at than some of my other friends. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good seeing you. 163 00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,841 &gt;&gt; ANGIE: You, too, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: So my office is here. This is our conference room. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Cool, right? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. I'm meeting with Noelle, who works for my mom, and we're making a phone call to Elizabeth, who's my business manager, whether or not I should make an offer on this home. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: Hello. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Hey, Elizabeth, it's Noelle. I have Rob here, too. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: Hi, how are you guys? &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Good. So I just wanted to talk about Rob's plan. I know he found this one place he really loved, and I know you guys were figuring out, you know, what we can make work. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: My honest opinion with that-- you really need, at minimum, 20% down. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: And you need enough money to, you know, set aside in case something goes wrong, and we're just not there yet. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not even going to bother telling my sisters or my mom because I already know they're going to criticize me 'cause I hear it all the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You seem like the biggest idiot and the biggest brat ever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are spoiled. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you go drink some more so you can lay in bed for the rest of your life? &gt;&gt; KIM: That'spathetic. You're 24 years old. Get ajob and don't live off your sister. Rob is just a loser. &gt;&gt; ROB: It sucks, but it's really important that I save up and I just make the right financial decision. So you suggest, just hold back, save, and eventually get something that's worth spending for? &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: That's exactly what I'm saying because I know what you want, Rob, and I don't want you to settle. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I agree. Let's keep this conversation between us just 'cause, you know, my sisters will just all talk and it will just cause me a headache and I really cannot deal, so if you all don't mind. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: Everything we talk about is private, so... &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Of course. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Okay, thanks, Elizabeth. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: You're welcome. Call me if you need anything else. &gt;&gt; ROB: Thanks, Elizabeth. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Okay, bye. 207 00:08:54,567 --> 00:09:00,239 &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh... not the best news. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hello. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Lamar. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo, where you at? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm just driving right now. Uh... what are you doing? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I am watching a game. I'm about to go home in, like, ten minutes. &gt;&gt; ROB: So, Lamar... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo. &gt;&gt; ROB: Whatcha think about me moving back in the... into the... in the Odom residence? Since I can't, you know, buy a home right now, my initial move would be to go back to Khloe and Lamar's, so that I can save up for a few more months and then buy a home. All right, cool. You know I love you, right? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Of course. How was London? &gt;&gt; ROB: London town. Ah, you know it was good. Spent a few freestyles of yeah, easy. You know, the usual trip. Anyway, Scott's calling me, but, um, make sure we got some food at the house, you know what I mean? (Lamar laughs, speaks indistinctly) Love you. Hey, dickey-boy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's it hanging? &gt;&gt; ROB: You know. Just getting mywet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, who isn't? Did you put an offer in on that place that we saw, the really nice one? &gt;&gt; ROB: I changed my mind on that house, and I actually don't even want it, so... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, well, if you want to look at anything else, just let me know. I'm down to go. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. But don't tell Kourt or any of my sisters or anything, all right? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I won't tell 240 00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,834 anybody. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A present for me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. It's a present for Sasha and Jordan for the, um, her shower. You know what, if you could put it right down there, that would be amazing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want to get it out of the hallway, 'cause it's not until Saturday. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There you go. Okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was golf? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Golf was great. Guess who I ran into on the, uh, golf course? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Angie Everhart. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Angie Everhart? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, former supermodel, man. It's good to see women out there. I try to get Kendall to play. It's just, like, such a great sport, especially for women. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, maybe you can get them together from one supermodel to another. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, she wants to play, so, uh, I'm gonna set up a golf game with her. Love you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A little kiss hello. Oh, that was the best kiss in the world! &gt;&gt; MASON: Ick. You have big lips. You have big... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, this is the pile that I wouldn't, like, mind if I had to keep. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: If they won't return. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Okay, look, really quick, will you grab me another bag? was looking for a place. Didn't you go house-hunting with him or something? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here's the thing, he wants to move back in with Lamar and I. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What happened to him buying a place? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, and... I don't know if I want him to move back in or not. Because when he moved in the first time... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...he took such advantage of every luxury, and Dancing he bailed and never even said bye to Lamar or thank you. And I don't want him to fall back into the cycle of taking advantage of being in the house and bossing the assistants around and getting his car washed for this, and that, like, it's just not... that's not responsible living. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The last time Rob lived with us, I feel like he was lacking a lot of motivation in life. I don't want him to get back to where he was before, because he's doing so well, and I want him to continue to stay motivated. And I love Rob, it's not about that, I just don't want to be the enabler, I don't want to... Like, I want to help Rob and not hurt him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would have, like, a serious meeting about it with him and Lamar. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you know Rob-- Rob is Mr. "I know, I know." It's, like, don't just me, dude. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Hello? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Angie! We talked about playing golf-- I got tomorrow free. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: That sounds fantastic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just a little bit more there. Come on, am I in Heaven? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Be more secure with where you live. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm secure with where I live, but you guys think I'm a moron, like I'm a little bitch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, then get some dude! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Hello? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Angie! Bruce Jenner. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: How are you, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How are you doing? &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I'm doing fantastic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, good. Well, I want you to know I'm a man of my word. Uh, we talked about playing golf; I got tomorrow free. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Where do you want to play? It sounds fantastic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We can meet at, like, Calabasas Country Club. It's close, it's easy. Good course. What time's good for you? &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I have all day tomorrow, actually. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 9:00, 10:00, somewhere in there. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Okay. Fantastic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a golfing date. I love it. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Okay, I can't wait. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'll see you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Okay, bye. 318 00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:30,936 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye-bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have a question, Bruce-- are you a practical father? Like, are you accepting of the things that come with dating, and people becoming a little older? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. But she's still 14. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. But I think she's practical... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When you were 14, we won't even talk about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But look how amazing I am now. I'm the only one out of all your kids that's actually married. You have one that has two babies out of wedlock, one that's been married twice... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This guy wants to move back in. To my house. &gt;&gt; ROB: Just because the moving... the house-search process is a pain, and it's... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a lot of work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And it is a lot of work, but I don't mind Rob moving in. It's actually fine, and Lamar and him have a great time and it's all that. I just don't want Rob to then get so comfortable not paying bills. If you're gonna live bills-free, this and that, I want to see production, I want to see him still doing things to make money. After talking with Kourt, I think it is gonna be a good decision that Rob comes back. I need to be responsible and just make sure that he still stays motivated working. And I feel like as long as I know, like, that's my duty, it's gonna be fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what Rob should do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hmm? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Never move back in with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, where is he supposed to go? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Find a place. Be a big boy. He's got enough money. &gt;&gt; ROB: I do have enough money. This is exactly why I didn't tell my family the truth in the beginning, that I can't afford this right now. I feel like I'm always being attacked. It is pretty hurtful for me to hear. I just chose to move out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He just doesn't want to spend it; he would rather just live with you guys. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I would rather live with someone that I enjoy living with and hang out with Lamar. I'm alone every day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bible, Rob, you can't get offended-- do you think my points are valid or no? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want you to, like, lose track and lose focus 'cause you're living with me. So tomorrow you're bringing just your clothes. &gt;&gt; ROB: But I can't bring anything else-- no room. All my furniture, I'm just gonna put in storage. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll make sure you actually do it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What, are you 368 00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,345 organizing, honey? You're always organizing. By the way, I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Oh, would you do me a favor? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Would you stop by and get a dress that I dropped off at the dry-cleaners? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh... no-- well, now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have to wear this dress tonight, on a red carpet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got a tee time in, like, 45 minutes and I got to warm up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You never have a tee time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, but I'm playing with Angie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Angie? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Angie Everhart. Remember? I told you the other day. She plays golf. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you're not gonna get my stuff 'cause you're with Angie? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I-I'll get... I'll make sure I get it. I'll leave some time. And I'll see you later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have a good time. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! There you are. Look at you. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How are you doing? &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I'm doing good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good to see you. Thanks for coming out. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: It's nice and warm today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know. We got a little warmth. Should I change putters, is the question. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: You putt good with your putter? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. But maybe there's one that I can just kind of stand over and it just goes in the hole. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I wish. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Shall we play? You need anything? &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I don't. I'm... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right, have fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: So, I'm warning you, I'm not a great golfer. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, come on. I'll get you there, I promise. Let's go warm up. I love playing with the, you know, with the ladies. The guys, everybody's, like, beating on each other and saying dirty things. You know, the girls are more civilized. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: And they have boobs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Yeah, and you're more pleasing to look at. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There you go. Still got that little fade. Get this shoulder just a little bit more there. See! See, look at that. That was long and straight. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Golf with Angie... she's a great looking lady. Good golfer. Great conversationalist. You know, if you want to water your game down and play from the women's tees, that's okay. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I'll take the challenge, Bruce. I can play off the same tees as you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, come on. Am I in heaven? &gt;&gt; ANGIE: There you go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah! Look at that. Damn, you're gonna outdrive me. By a mile. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: I actually did outdrive you on that one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One down, 17 to go. 423 00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:23,428 It will be a good day. Let's go do it. &gt;&gt; MOVER: How about the records? &gt;&gt; ROB: The records-- so yeah. So now this is gonna go to Khloe and Lamar's, All right? And the records, but she'll, they'll be room for it. She just doesn't know yet. But I think there will be. I think it'll be fine. So today I am moving out of my apartment and into Khloe's home. You know, even though this isn't, like, my ideal situation, I am very fortunate, and it's just a very good position to be in right now. All right. See you in a bit. &gt;&gt; MOVER: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: In the kitchen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was great. I don't know what it is. I mean, you play with the guys it's like they talk about the same old stuff all the time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, that's what guys do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, different subjects. This and that. She's a great golfer. She got me on the last hole. I couldn't believe it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What does that mean, "She got you on the last hole?" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I hit it, she hit it in closer, and I wound up three putting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, you know what? Could you bring my dry cleaning in? Because I have to change. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I forgot to get your dry cleaning. I'm sorry. It's five minutes away. I'm gonna go get it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're kidding, right? You're kidding? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm not kidding. Ten minutes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't have ten minutes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm moving. You're gonna have to. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, I don't have ten minutes, and how could you forget my dry cleaning? It's the one thing I asked you to do today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's not gonna do me any good on a red carpet at 5:00... you're sorry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I will get it back in ten minutes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't need the dress, Bruce. I'll find something else to wear, but thanks for thinking of me today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm wasting time.

I guarantee you half of those boxes are going in the trash anyways. Just chill out. It's gonna be gone in the morning. My family, like, has zero faith in me I feel. Khloe is furious from the second I got here. Obviously I'm gonna handle and unpack everything. Just give me like one night's rest. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you see what he did to the garage? I want to show you the garage. Come here, baby. Come and see this.... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm happy to have Rob back at the crib, but sometimes Rob can be disrespectful without even knowing it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo. Oh, This is all his stuff? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, and he said he was only bringing clothes. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: So it's a little cluttered right now, and that drives Khloe crazy. Yeah, I think she might be a little OCD. It's funny cause Rob is the same way. Yeah, he was slick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I literally have Mt. Everest in my garage. Do you not think this is a little crazy? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, I didn't know he had this much stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what I said. I'm just, like, did I make the wrong decision? Is he already falling back into taking advantage of my generosity? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, ask Lamar? Lamar said it's a lot of stuff. Why do you have wine glasses? Shouldn't all that be in storage? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, all of that is in there. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not gonna open every single box. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but it's all marked. &gt;&gt; ROB: I already told them... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you should've been overseeing it. 517 00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:45,156 &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No "Mm-hmm." &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I'm great. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dandy. &gt;&gt; KIM: So my mom asks me to come by her office to tell me something. I have no idea what's going on. Like, something has got be wrong. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, uh, Bruce has a major, mad crush on Angie Everhart. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good for him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, not good for him. He's crazy hot about somebody else, and she's hot. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're ridiculous. he's not doing anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think Bruce is cheating on me, but Bruce and I have sort of gotten into this routine where we're not exactly dating anymore. So maybe he's crushing on Angie right now. And I'm a little embarrassed to say that... it's kind of bugging me a little bit. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do they do? They golf every day? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, they're going golfing. &gt;&gt; KIM: We'll go to the golf course and see what's up. See how they interact with each other. But then you really need to step it up. Buy some lingerie. Do what you gotta do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are we gonna do at the golf course? Pretend like we're golfing at the same exact tee-off time that they have? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, they will not see us. We'll go and we'll spy on them. Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I forgot who I was talking to. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm a perfect spy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are. You're like, you should be, like, a super spy. You could have an office and make bazillions, how good you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't worry, we won't get caught. I definitely don't think Bruce would ever cheat on my mom or anything like that, but then again my mom is probably so crazy that she's not giving it up. So the only way to convince my mom that nothing is going on is just to spy on Bruce and Angie so she can see for herself. So Operation Angie Everhart here we come. What are your thoughts on mermaids? Cause Angie kind of looks like Ariel. A gorgeous version. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, that doesn't help that you tell me that Bruce's new girlfriend looks like a mermaid... 'cause that's kind of sexy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, you need to upload to my computer. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; ROB: What up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was a jolly hello. &gt;&gt; ROB: I said "Yo." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How's moving going? &gt;&gt; ROB: Fine. I'm gonna go eat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, make yourself at home. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: He sounds like he's in a cheery mood today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. What a little &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, um, quick piece of advice... when you're on a mission... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm on the phone. What's up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: With who? &gt;&gt; ROB: With somebody about business. No, that's Khloe, and she's out of her place right now, and it's rude and disrespectful, and I'm on a call. Anyways, I'll talk to you later. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do not like any of the energy that's now coming into my home. Just his tone... is just so disrespectful to me. You came in here with such an attitude. &gt;&gt; ROB: I got two hours of sleep and I had to wake up... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who cares? You're the one that wanted to go out last night. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's great, but we don't need to go, like, give each other kisses and like that. You don't get on Lamar when he just walks to his room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob? &gt;&gt; ROB: Shut up! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You came in here with an attitude. &gt;&gt; ROB: And I said "Yo" and brought my bag and set it around. And now I'm in here eating. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Soeat and shut up! &gt;&gt; ROB: So I'm eating food, come in your house looking like a slob. Oh, I live in Khloe and Lamar's and I'm a loser. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Be more secure with where you live. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm secure with where I live, but everything you guys have been talking about since yesterday has been negative. You guys think I'm a moron, like I'm a little bitch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoa, this kid is insane. I'm really just trying to get him to do what he says he's gonna do. Pick up the pace and pack your so everything could be done, and then we could hang out and have a good time. I'm trying to help your ass. My point is, if you're going to be here, take advantage of it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I know, I heard what you said the other night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, so it's not being negative. You want that as being negative, then maybe you should get out. If this is day one of living together and your attitude is worse than it's ever been, this will not work. &gt;&gt; ROB: You don't know how much I hear from "Oh, you're the loser who lives with his sister, da-da-da..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, then get some balls, dude! &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yeah, I have 'em, you moron. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut theup! I'm not going to deal with this &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so mad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Relax, he's not doing anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just pisses me off. I don't think I was prepared for what I was going to see when I came out here. Sometimes I think maybe there is another chapter for me. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Without Bruce? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm here. Awesome. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's like the first time you've been on time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are they playing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: At, um, Calabasas Country Club, and their tee time is, like, in ten minutes, so we got to go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I got binoculars. I am ready to go for this excursion. We're going to go to the golf course today to spy on Bruce and Angie. All we have to do is bring some binoculars, keep our distance. We'll definitely see everything that we need to see. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If we get caught, Kim, I'llkill you. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're not going to get caught. I am, like, the master. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Cheaters 101. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I promise you that Kim was probably a spy in her former life. She could be an FBI agent in about two seconds. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have a night vision camera? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, damn. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was Paris Hilton. Don't act obvious. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think we should have worn, like, golf clothes? &gt;&gt; KIM: We should have. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So we'd blend in with the locals. Hold on, we're going. Just look as normal as possible. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this guy playing by himself? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I guess so. &gt;&gt; KIM: See, you don't want Bruce to look that pathetic, playing by himself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what Bruce does all day long at Sherwood. &gt;&gt; KIM: So maybe you should be thankful he has a buddy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, not a buddy that looks like Angie Everhart, thank you very much. Is that him? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. Yeah, yes, yes. Mom, don't kill us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Duck, duck, duck. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, but you got to slow down. Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Duck behind this tree. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, I see red hair. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, well, you know what that means-- fire crotch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Why are they having so much fun? He doesn't have this much fun with me when we played golf before. &gt;&gt; KIM: Because you're so boring and you've been together for 21 years. Nothing's fun at that point. She's so pretty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, she's not that great. And she's got her glove tucked in her ass. Oh,, they're looking this way. I swear, they're looking this way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, wait, Bruce, Bruce is so old, he can't see us. Move, get up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He just put his arm around her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, Mom, maybe we should go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That mother &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, it's not what it seems. They're playing golf, he's helping her with her swing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, that's not playing golf. That's not part of the game, okay? I've never really been around Bruce when I feel like he's had chemistry with somebody else. After 21 years of marriage, I don't think I was prepared for what I was going to see when I came out here. I'm so mad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Relax, he's not doing 686 00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:14,372 anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just pisses me off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How was your workout? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It was cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll just say, thank goodness you weren't here earlier. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Thank goodness I wasn't here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's a brat. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Robert? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's locked up in his room. He's a little bitch. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Well, I guess there's two bitches in the house today. No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He has major psychological problems. He owes me an apology. 699 00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:49,807 He won't answer. That is Lamar trying to talk to you, Robert, so intercom the man room. Rob isn't hearing how he's speaking to me. If Lamar was here to hear how he was talking to me, Lamar would say, "We're opening up the house to you, you're being rude." See, he wants to talk to you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo. &gt;&gt; ROB: What's up, brother man? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You're on speaker. You want me to pick it up? &gt;&gt; ROB: Or meet me in the man room. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Absolutely right. What are you doing, bro? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, now I know how you feel, man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Now I know how you feel"? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Khloe understood that. &gt;&gt; ROB: Get out of my house, then. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I won't bother you, man. I'll bother you, I'll bother you later. When Khloe and Rob argue, and it's, like, their brother-sister thing going on, like, I like to stay away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think he's going to be kicked out by the end of the day. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: He's sticking to it, too, like, he's not gonna, he's not gonna break. Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's getting kicked out. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Ladies, one more time, all the way on the end here, ladies, here we go. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Can we get one with candid chatting amongst yourselves? &gt;&gt; JILLIAN: Oh, yeah, that's not too awkward now. So, anyway... &gt;&gt; GIULIANA: Sleep with any good guys lately? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I have. &gt;&gt; JILLIAN: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm here today at the Association of Breast and Prostate Cancer charity event, and Giuliana Rancic, Jillian Reynolds, and I are being honored with the Women of Achievement Award. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated. The program is about to begin. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so annoyed. I can't seem to get Bruce on the phone, and I wanted to tell him something before this lunch started. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I think he has a crush on Angie Everhart. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was watching them the other day together and the way he is with her, and he's flirting with her, he's totally flirting with her. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Come on, no, he's not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, he's totally flirting with her. It's like they have this chemistry and connection. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: I mean, he's so in love with you, I don't think... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Wait, Bruce is hanging out with who? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Angie Everhart. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: The redhead? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And he's got-- yeah. I'll tell you something. If Bruce is, you know, getting flirty with Angie, I'm not gonna hang out and... twiddle my thumbs. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: That's crazy talk. I mean, you know, he's, like, obsessed with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe it's time that I go have that long-awaited talk Todd wants to have. I know I sound a little crazy, but my old boyfriend has been reaching out for quite a while, wanting to meet up, and I've said no time and time again, but I do feel like there's some unfinished business. Maybe it's not such a bad idea. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: I don't know. The way you're feeling with Bruce and Angie, I don't think maybe right now is the right time to meet up with Todd. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes you just feel like, in a marriage, that you are just... You, you don't know whether to hang on anymore or not. Sometimes I think maybe there is another chapter for me. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Without Bruce? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Hey, how are you? &gt;&gt; TODD: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When I see Todd walk in, I don't feel nervous at all. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. Are you gonna say hi, or no? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not talking to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, you've been a ever since you moved in here. I just don't get it. Like, seriously, if you want to act like this-- you're not even gonna say hi to me when you come in the room? &gt;&gt; ROB: Things have gotten, you know, to a point where Khloe wants me out of the house, and this is just a complete misunderstanding, so it's time for me to, you know, let her know the real reason that I moved back in with her. I'm just frustrated with my situation. Like, I was about to put, you know, a bunch of money down and buy a home, and then, you know, apparently, I don't have, like, enough. The business managers are, like, "You really should be smart and, you know, save your money right now," so that I don't have to feel like I need you guys or Mom or someone to back me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you should, and that's, like, a responsible way of thinking. You're 25 years old. Most people at 25 years old don't own their own property. Like, when I got my first apartment, I was determined to get a two-bedroom townhouse, and I would not get a one-bedroom apartment, and Dad was, like, "It's your money, but, hey..." And I got it, and I was in over my head every single month. And it was the biggest, dumbest... mistake I've ever done. I mean, Dad would be really proud of you for not getting in over your head. So it's nothing to be embarrassed about, it's nothing for you to have an attitude about-- you're taking the smart road. For Rob to actually want to be responsible and move in and save his money, I'm so proud of him for that. And I understand maybe why he had such a bad attitude, because I think he was disappointed in himself. But you've got to promise me... &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Promise... you will give me attitude in my house again. &gt;&gt; ROB: Firm handshake. I will never give you attitude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And if you do... &gt;&gt; ROB: And if I do... I will reduce the size of my penis. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't have a penis. You have a Rob, Lamar thinks I'm like Cleopatra and I'm gonna marry my brother. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's not gonna happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You won'tme? &gt;&gt; ROB: I couldn't even look at you when you say that. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you think? I need your opinion. Red or black? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Red or black? When's the last time you cared about what shirt you wore to the golf course? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Never mind. I'm meeting Ange at the golf course, and I got to get there first because I'm the member and I got to tell the guy at the guard gate to, you know, make sure she can get in, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Ange"? You're meeting "Ange"? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This whole thing, playing golf with Angie, it's not like I'm fooling around. But to be honest with you, a woman that's not yelling at me... I like that. And don't call me, because we don't allow cell phones at the golf course, but you can text me, okay? 'Cause I can get away with a text. I don't want Angie waiting, so I'll be back. Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, we don't want Ange to wait. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Text me, don't call, remember. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I never knew how I was gonna feel if I ever ran into you again. &gt;&gt; TODD: Right. Same here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, are you dating anybody? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: Boulevard Management. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, is Elizabeth there? It's Khloe. &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: Okay, hold on one moment, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: How are you? &gt;&gt; ROB: Is that Elizabeth, darling? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's Elizabeth. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: Who is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's Rob. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: Hi, Rob! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, as you know, Rob has moved in here. And so what I've discussed with Rob is... I want to have a system in place, 'cause say he's here for a year, and then it's time for him to move out again, I don't want him to be at square one, where he has nothing saved. I definitely want to help Rob remain as responsible as he's being right now, so I just want to get some ideas as to what we can do to continue Rob's really great transformation, I would say, of becoming a man. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: My recommendation is to have Rob pay you rent. And then you could be putting it in a savings account for him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: That way the money is locked up, but for his benefit when he moves out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: You're just sheltering the money for him so that he doesn't spend it foolishly, knowing that he doesn't need to pay rent. &gt;&gt; ROB: I love that Khloe's so supportive, and like, you know, she's driving me to save my money. 'Cause she wants me to get the home that I want to get, and it is a relief that I can stop thinking, like, I'm just mooching or freeloading off them. Thank you. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: Bye, Rob. Bye, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. &gt;&gt; ROB: Cheerio. Seriously, I just had a job where I got a lot of money, so I can give you at least, like, $3,000 for this month. Just to be safe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Don't go spending it all in one place. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not for me, my friend. This is the start of a new 876 00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:30,127 adventure. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: See you in a bit. How long have you guys been open? &gt;&gt; WAITER: About six months, I believe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. You can just throw it in there. &gt;&gt; WAITER: How's that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's good. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Nice, elegant pour. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. Cheers. It probably sounds so childish, but if Bruce is going to go to the golf course and hang out with Angie all day long, I'm not going to feel guilty about wanting to meet up with Todd. &gt;&gt; TODD: Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! How are you? &gt;&gt; TODD: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ha, ha. &gt;&gt; TODD: You got... you got me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you always 30 minutes late? &gt;&gt; TODD: Am I always 30 minutes late? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TODD: You're good. Thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's sit over there. When I see Todd walk in, kind of the coolest feeling came over me. &gt;&gt; TODD: You look very nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. I don't feel nervous at all. &gt;&gt; TODD: So how you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Want anything to drink? &gt;&gt; TODD: Yeah, I'm definitely gonna have something. We might as well get this party started. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; TODD: Can I have a, uh, Stoli Cranberi? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; TODD: Thanks. &gt;&gt; WAITER: My pleasure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so tell me what's going on with you. &gt;&gt; TODD: Well, we did see each other at tennis. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. So we have to go from there. &gt;&gt; TODD: I'm still trying to figure out how you found me there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You found me there. You for... you totally... &gt;&gt; TODD: I go there-- I've been going there for a year. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but you knew... You had to have known that I was going to show up. Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Whoo! That was fun. fun. I love it. &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Good that I could beat you on a few holes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've had a tough day. You know, you've gotten better every... every time we've played. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 23 years. That's a really long time to not see somebody. And then, suddenly, go back to that place. Like, that's crazy. You just start thinking about all the stuff that you've been through with somebody. &gt;&gt; TODD: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Or all the emotions that you felt, and... I never knew how it was going to feel if I ever ran into you again. &gt;&gt; TODD: Right. Same here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't feel, like, in control of my emotions. And I had to learn how to breathe again. &gt;&gt; TODD: You're in control right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We'll do it again! &gt;&gt; ANGIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really, we'll do it again. That was a good time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, are you dating anybody? &gt;&gt; TODD: Let's go there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go there. &gt;&gt; TODD: Okay. I don't have a girlfriend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How come you never got married? Like, you're an attractive single guy. How can you wait for somebody for 23 years? &gt;&gt; TODD: I think timing's everything. is everything. &gt;&gt; TODD: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. &gt;&gt; TODD: How much time do we have tonight? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um... as much time as you need. Next on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need to go to the dentist. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here. I'm trying to help you. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so funny to see such a big man squirm over the word "dentist." &gt;&gt; DENTIST: Sweet dreams. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I... had to meet up with Todd again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What an idiot you are. Explain to me why you saw this &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think they'd ever get a divorce?
