- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why was Bianca Lawson's mom at my sweet 16? &gt;&gt; KIM: Who theis Bianca Lawson? This is the cutest picture I've ever seen in my entire life of you and Dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I Photoshop the four double chins and the braces for her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at Bruce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom looks like a full-blown geisha. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She was pregnant with Kendall. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think she was pregnant. Can you believe Kendall's turning 16? That's crazy. My sweet 16 party, I remember my mom and my dad rented out this Italian restaurant. I was so skinny then. I loved it. It's, like, funny to see how, like, ridiculous we were. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're getting very sad that you're turning 16. Do you know I was 16 when you were born? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Really? I'm excited to be 16, first off, because I can drive. &gt;&gt; KIM: Party! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And, second, I think it just sounds older. So it'll make me sound cooler. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to show Kendall my sweet 16. My sweet 16 was at the Bistro Garden restaurant in Beverly Hills. My mom definitely surprised me with the party that she planned, and it was a really fun day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know, on my actual 16th birthday, Mom was out of town-- I think she was in Hawaii-- a flatbed comes to the house with a brand-new Mercedes SL convertible. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: On your birthday? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: On my birthday. I call Mom, crying. "Oh, I got a car!" Guess whose car it was. Mom's car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I gave birth to you. I was treating myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look how cute. Is that Daddy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall, do you know what Mom does on everyone's sweet 16? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This one is Kourt's. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, when you walk into the party, that's, like, the center of attention. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom didn't care enough to cut mine out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I gave you a luncheon at Spago. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, Kendall, what do you want to do for your sweet 16? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I want this to be kind of like a low-key party. I don't want it to be something, like, huge. I'm really grateful for the privileges and opportunities that I have, but because there's so many people struggling right now, so many families struggling, I just want to do something simple with my family and friends. Khloe knows this 'cause I've talked to her about it, but for my birthday, I really want a tattoo. &gt;&gt; KIM: What?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Over my dead body. I am so against tattoos. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A tattoo? &gt;&gt; KIM: I hate tattoos. If you're not able to vote, you should not be able to get a tattoo. Like, what would you even want? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: On the back of my neck, I want to get "you're beautiful" in French, because, being in high school, it's just, like, a reassuring thing that everyone's beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love the meaning of her tattoo, "you are beautiful." Nowadays, when kids go home from being bullied, they're still continuously bullied by the Internet. Her tattoo, it's not about herself; it's about everyone knowing you are beautiful no matter what. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How old were you when you got a tattoo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was 17, and I told Kendall I regret it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't think it's a good idea. We definitely have to talk to Daddy. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I need to talk to him, but I don't know how. My dad is the last person in the world that I want to ask about my tattoo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He'll never say yes. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He hates tattoos, and he's never going to give me his permission. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now they have a law in the state of California that you cannot get a tattoo until you're over 18. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sorry, can't get it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, you ready for this? A little car shopping? Don't be in such a rush. Wait for me. Kendall and Kylie both, you have to call them my little babies, because they'll always be the last two. You know, it's tough to see them grow up. I can't believe we're actually looking at cars. You're so cute! You know, I'll miss the drives to school every morning, because that's the one time we get to talk and... You know, it's tough on a dad. Let's take it for a ride. When they're small, they want to hold your hand, they love you to death, they want to go everywhere with you... and then they become teenagers. Actually, you're a very good driver. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Who was the best besides me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kourtney, Khloe and Kim were not that good at the start. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kourtney always drove so fast and so recklessly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I mean, Rob was good at the start. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: All I've wanted since I was maybe nine years-- even younger, I don't know-- I've only wanted to be able to drive. And I'm excited to take my test. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, here's the deal, Kendall, on this party. Yeah, I'm a little concerned. I don't want any drinking going on. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What are you trying to say? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want to make sure that the party is done right and no hanky-panky. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, you're crazy. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? 104 00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:37,611 I'm not crazy. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's just weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you excited, Kendall? I bet Sharon will have some really good ideas for your party. Sharon Sacks is one of the world's most amazing party planners. I know, just when you thought you were done with me. She plans all of our family celebrations that we've had for years. You are having a party! &gt;&gt; SHARON: And it's for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: La la! We could be the entertainment. Yeah. &gt;&gt; SHARON: What do you want to do? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't want it to be that big. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Got it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe we'll go to the Santa Monica Pier. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe we'll rent the Staples Center. I want to come up with something for Kendall's party that no one's ever done before. You know, big, big, big. There are so many things we could do. We could have a red carpet party, because you're a model. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, no. I hate being the center of attention. It's not me. I don't like it. I get really nervous and embarrassed. I feel bad that my mom's coming up with all these ideas and I'm kind of just turning her down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to give me a shot at showing you the different places that I like, and then I'll go look at the places that you like. 132 00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:46,546 I at least have to... like it. Okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scotty, what are the girls doing? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Action! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, I'm Kourtney. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you up to? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall's party. Her little sweet 16 party. We don't want it to turn into a not-so-sweet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, they are getting a little bit older than you think. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know. You know, Kendall is my ninth child. I've seen a lot of kids grow up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a live set! Everyone, be quiet! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The older girls, who are absolutely a handful. Kourtney was just tough as nails. Kim was certainly a very strong woman. And Khloe, well... she was sneaking out of the house at 14. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really couldn't be quiet for 30 minutes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's hard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, we've been discussing things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You just got oil all over my shirt. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No! That just happened? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's crazy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That is right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Guys, I-I'm just kind of concerned. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: About? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, just keeping the party under control. I don't want any drinking going on there, basically. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, or drugs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But she's 16! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it's not... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely was drinking at 16. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, you were drinking. You were-- you were all. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe was on tour with Puff when she was 16! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did not start drinking till later. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You were driving cars at 15. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I stole cars at 15. I wasn't drinking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In high school, I brought a backpack with, like, alcohol inside. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, don't tell Bruce this story. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right, and she was the good kid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I threw up on the front lawn at Marymount. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're really making me feel better. It kind of confirms my fears. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I brought the drink backpack with the thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: With the thing... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm leaving more worried than I did when I got here. I'm leaving-- I'm going to go to the golf course. Hasta luego. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're really supposed to slow down a little bit when you get to the speed bumps. Kendall's really never planned a big party like this before, and she's really got to have a little faith in her mom. This is not my first day to the rodeo. We can rent out the entire Four Seasons. You could do an ice-skating rink in the middle of the room. You could do a bowling alley on one side and a complete, like, go-cart thing on the other. We could do a whole Cirque du Soleil thing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I only want about 50 people at my party, and this place is a little too big. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What if we did an invitation all in Chinese? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, what if we had to, like, come in original, like, Chinese dress? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Henna tattoos? Today was kind of a wash. We came up with nothing. I don't know, this whole thing is getting really stale to me, and I think we need to really have a brainstorming session and think about something that will be really, really unique and different. I think that we're going to have to go back to the drawing board, and maybe I'll come up with something even more spectacular. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can you just take my phone so I don't, like, have it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Today, the big day. The driving test. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Stop, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The tension mounts. Any time you deal with the DMV, it's important to get there early. Bright and early, we got up, we got to the DMV so we'll be first in line. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Okay, we're going to be gone about 15 minutes. If you guys would like to wait in front of the building or inside the building. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've done all my studying. I've done everything I could do. I feel like I'm ready for this test, but I'm still kind of 208 00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:10,984 nervous. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: I'm not going to be able to pass you today. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: The reason being is on the right turns, when you go through bicycle lanes, you didn't look over your shoulder. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I really knew that. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Huh? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I knew that, I swear. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: I don't... I-I gave you three tries at it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is there anything I can do? &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: You have to wait two weeks. And then you can come back and retest. Okay? Sorry. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I failed my driver's test. It's so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Be aware of what's going on around her. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Exactly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Exactly, okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We'll be back! &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Stop! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, we got to get you to school. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm not going to school. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go, let's... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's not... No, Dad! I just wanted the lady to pass me. I've waited so long to take this test, and I've had all this anxiety about it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We've got to get you to school. You've got to go to school. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He doesn't even care. He's, like, "Okay, let's just go to school." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's just two weeks. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He's being really insensitive. My dad just doesn't get it. He has no idea what I'm going through. Are we parallel parking? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, actually you are. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Aah, I'm so scared! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go... Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why would you tell Kourtney that I'm having my birthday at the Bahamas? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who doesn't want to go to the Bahamas for their 16th birthday? 247 00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,446 &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No one, Mom. It's embarrassing me! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. You know, I kind of get nervous with you driving. I am not good in the passenger seat. But then to also hear that parallel parking is not a requirement on a driver's test is also very frightening. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are we going to the toy store first? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, we're going to Tom's Toys. Put on your blinker. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are we parallel parking right now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, actually you are! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're on the curb! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Aah, I'm so scared! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go... Oh, my God. Oh, it's so far. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're good. You're doing good. Perfect. That is the scariest thing I think that's ever happened to me. Kendall and I are shopping at the toy store for the Children's Hospital, and I definitely want to bring Kendall, because Kendall sometimes feels guilty for her own blessings. And as long as you give back, then you cannot feel guilty for the blessings that you have. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Have a good day, guys. 271 00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,578 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You, too. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Wow, welcome wagon. Someone has flowers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Sergio. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm Kendall. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's your name? &gt;&gt; MICHAEL: Michael. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Michael, nice to meet you. This is Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm Kendall. Nice to meet you. Hi, Freda. &gt;&gt; FREDA: Hi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How are you? &gt;&gt; FREDA: Good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good. How's your day been? &gt;&gt; FREDA: Fine. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Have you chosen any toys? You have? Do you like to draw? &gt;&gt; FREDA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, me, too. But I'm not good at it at all. I just like to. Do you have any brothers or sisters? &gt;&gt; FREDA: Yeah, I have an older brother. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You do? I have an older brother, too. I have four. Being with this girl really does make me realize how blessed I am, and it makes me feel guilty having such an extravagant party when there's people that are much less fortunate. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Bye. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thanks for having us. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Happy birthday! &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Happy birthday. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. I actually really enjoyed coming here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See? 299 00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:50,036 It's your special. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I smelled something was brewing in here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just feel a little chill in the air, if you know what I mean. do, 'cause you're in a sweater, and it's 100 degrees outside. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was that whole Children's Hospital thing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It was good. It was really fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, I have the biggest surprise for you ever. I've been looking for the perfect way to celebrate Kendall's sweet 16, and I think I finally found it. I just got an offer from people in the Bahamas that want to host you and 75 of your best friends for your 16th birthday. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't think my mom hears me when I say I don't want a big party, and the Bahamas party is way too extravagant. Um, that's sweet of you, but it's just, like, a little embarrassing that you're trying to get me to have this huge party. Like, I just feel wrong. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're just going to tell me no without really thinking about it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall may be saying no now, but I really feel like Kendall's going to come to her senses. It's too good to pass up. I'm trying to sell a sweet 16 party that Kendall won't have anything to do with. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love you, Mom, but that's just way too big. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can I talk to you? I did a little research and found out that in Vegas you can get a tattoo with just a parent's consent. Before I start, you have to listen to my full story. Do not talk until I say go. Okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've been really nervous to tell you this, but I think I'm going to get a tattoo. Don't make that face at me. What I want to get-- it would be hidden. It would be on the back of my neck, and I want to get, "You're beautiful" in French, because, being in, like, high school, it's kind of like a reassuring thing to everyone, that everyone's beautiful in their own way. So, that's what I want to get. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can I talk? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, now you can talk. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I knew you'd say that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Every time I look at you from the back, I got to see this stupid tattoo? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. You would not see it, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then why have it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Because I like it. It's a reassuring thing. It's just like for... Got to go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no. Don't-Don't leave. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're being annoying. You're laughing at me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not laughing at you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He's not taking me seriously. He's, like, "Why do you want it?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you ask him why he feels the need to have two diamond earrings on? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Then go talk to him, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am not really for Kendall getting a tattoo at 16 years old, but I'm going to go talk to Bruce, because I don't think it's helping that he's laughing this off. She's just asking for a little bit of patience and understanding. She's asking you instead of doing it. I think that's... You should have a little respect for that, and have a little... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I respect it, and I say no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's a good girl. She doesn't do anything bad ever. You will not get asked permission to do much after this child turns 18, which is in 24 months. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, when you're 18-- that's two years from now-- make your own decisions. You'll be an adult. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's, like, not even fair, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I think it's fair. To me, Kendall wanting a tattoo is reckless, so that scares me. Maybe I should start worrying a little bit more about, you know, what she's doing out there. I'm scared about this party. I'm going to have security there. I'm going to make sure there's no drinking, no fooling around. going to have security there? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God, help us, okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, you and your security. Get your little policeman's outfit on and your whistle, and we'll see you there. 382 00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,994 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now I lost my appetite. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What's up? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He said no, but, like, he's never going to see it. You have to keep this a secret, but I think I'm going to go to Vegas to get a tattoo. I never wanted it to come to this, but my dad doesn't understand what this tattoo means to me and why it's so important. Look, here's a flight for, like, 11:00 in the morning to go to Vegas. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And how do you expect to get the tattoo when you're there? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: All I need is, like, a consent form. Mom, like, didn't exactly say no, but I just need to get her to sign it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You have fun with that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So will you go with me? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: If I didn't go, would you go alone? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Come on, Kylie! Just come! I'll call the car service right now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: If you call the car service, I will go. It is crazy that my sister is asking me to go to Vegas with her, but I'm in. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I need it this Saturday, and I have an 11:00 o'clock flight, so can it please be here at 8:00? Great. Thank you. Bye. Hmm. You have to spit swear that you 408 00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:46,899 don't tell anybody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! It's Friday night lights, Sierra Canyon, the undefeated team. Tonight is the big game against Paraclete. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's all right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, what's going on, Bruce, with Kenny's tattoo? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't believe you would even let that happen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not. I'm fighting it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look what happened to Rob. He looks like he's jail mate One-five-eight-one-four. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. You're preaching to the choir, Scott. &gt;&gt; CHEERLEADERS: Push 'em back! Push 'em back! Defense! Defense! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You should appreciate that I came out for this. This is not my cup of tea. Watch your hands in the football game, babe. &gt;&gt; CHEERLEADERS: One, two, three. 427 00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:47,593 SCH! Go, Sierra! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have to talk to Kendall and tell her that I can't go to her birthday. My mom called me and told me to clear my calendar for Kendall's sweet 16 and that it's in the Bahamas, and I just can't go. Wait, I have to tell you something, but I feel really bad. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That I cannot go to your birthday party in the Bahamas. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? I'm not having a party in the Bahamas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, you are. Mom sent me the itinerary. She's like, "I just need a yes or no from everyone." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's insane. My mom-- she needs to calm down and she needs to believe that this is my party and not hers. I'm gonna talk to her. That's annoying 'cause she did it without my permission. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you have a normal party here, I will be 445 00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,807 there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good job, good job. Another victory! Honey! &gt;&gt; KRIS: At the bar. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Of course. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where I belong. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you have your gin and tonic? Are you ready to go? Are you ready to hear Sierra Canyon-Paraclete game? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why would you tell Kourtney that I'm having my birthday at the Bahamas? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's in the Bahamas. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, I'm not gonna do it. Do you not understand? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like maybe you're acting a little unappreciative. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're trying to make this bigger and bigger, and it's embarassing me. You're just giving me this, like you're just handing it to me. I don't want it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I want to get a surprise performer for Kendall's party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you guys want to call Lil Wayne's person? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I like Lil Wayne. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're here. &gt;&gt; MARIO: You want it on your... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Back of my neck, 466 00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,791 yeah. &gt;&gt; MARIO: In the back. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, you're trying to make this bigger and bigger, and it's embarassing me. It makes me feel bad. There's people in the world that don't have much, and you're just giving me this, like you're just 472 00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,308 handing it to me. I don't want it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There are starving people in the world, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, I get where she's coming from, I really do, and I think it's amazing. All you had to do was let me know that, Kendall. We're staying here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You know what I'd really like to do? Have everyone, instead of bringing me a gift, bring a gift that I could donate to the children's hospital. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That would mean more to me than any party in the world. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'd like to do that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall is a really sweet and sensitive girl, and what impresses me about her the most is that she always thinks of everyone else before she thinks about herself. I love you, Kendall. I got to do what you want to do. We're off to see one of Kendall's venue choices. Kendall's been dying to look at these venues and hotels that have a rooftop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rooftop. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Roof. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not "ruff." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'll show you rough if you don't shut up, and let's go upstairs. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So your guests would come in this way. &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, is this like something you had in mind? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's so perfect. I really think the Andaz West Hollywood could be perfect. It's everything I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you guys think? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's so good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And they can do, like, little baskets of fries. &gt;&gt; MAN: Perfect timing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And voilà, it's like magic around here. You say it and it appears. I have to admit, it's fabulous. Kendall, I did not give you enough credit that you have the most amazing taste. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love this place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me a hug. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Happy birthday. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I want to show you what we're gonna do at her party. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is what we're gonna do when we walk out onto the stage. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Five, six, seven, eight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah. We could be the entertainment. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you guys want to call Lil Wayne's person? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I like Lil Wayne. I want to get a surprise performer for Kendall's party, so Kourtney, Khloe, and I are calling up a bunch of her favorite performers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, is this Cortez? &gt;&gt; CORTEZ: Yeah, what's up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, it's Khloe. &gt;&gt; CORTEZ: Yeah, yeah, I heard about the party. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, is Wayne...? &gt;&gt; CORTEZ: He's not available. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who else do you manage? &gt;&gt; CORTEZ: Drake also, but he has a concert that day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I'm having a little bit of a problem. A lot of the people are on tour. They can't just say, "Oh, we'll stop a tour date and come to you." &gt;&gt; TYGA: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, is this Tyga? &gt;&gt; TYGA: Yeah, what up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, it's Khloe Kardashian. Kim gave me your number. &gt;&gt; TYGA: What up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Our little sister Kendall is turning 16 and we are throwing her a sweet 16 party. We wanted to know if you would come and perform. &gt;&gt; TYGA: I'm on tour right now, so I'm not sure. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm starting to get really nervous because no one can commit 100% yet. I hope we can just pull someone through and get a performer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just let us know if you can, the sooner the better, because time is of an essence, my friend. &gt;&gt; TYGA: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, are you ready? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, let's do this. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie and I are on our way to Las Vegas, which I'm really excited about. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good morning. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, that's your nutritious breakfast? Look at you two, all dressed up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey. 544 00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:09,348 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um, our friend is having, like, a mall thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A mall thing-- you're going to the mall? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I can live with that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm starting to feel a little guilty that I'm going to get a tattoo behind my dad's back. Bye, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We'll see you tonight. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Be careful. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're here. Whoa. 556 00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:50,155 Look at this place. This place is huge. I'm, like, getting so nervous. Kylie and I kind of tricked my mom into signing a consent form for me to get my tattoo. My mom signs documents all day long, so it was perfect. Hello. &gt;&gt; MARIO: Hello, how are you doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; MARIO: Good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm Kendall. &gt;&gt; MARIO: Hi, I'm Mario. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've been e-mailing with Mario the tattoo artist, and he's been telling me what the font's going to look like. I can't wait to see it. &gt;&gt; MARIO: Look what we have for you. When you choose the style, we're going to go on and make a stencil. You want it on your... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Back of my neck, yeah. &gt;&gt; MARIO: In the back. Awesome, thanks. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have to make a phone call. I'll be right back. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Khlo. I really want to go to the Sugar Factory and get Kendall candy for her sweet 16. I know that's her favorite candy shop ever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have an account. Take whatever you want and charge it to me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, cool. &gt;&gt; MARIO: It's your first tattoo? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, that's why I'm so nervous. &gt;&gt; MARIO: Just relax. Let me get you the mirror. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just need a lot of candy. These are all really cool. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie. Kylie is nowhere to be found and I'm really nervous. I don't have anyone to tell me whether I should do it or not, whether it looks good, and I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't heard back from Tyga yet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Work your magic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are turning into, like, a mini Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You better not have gotten a tattoo. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What are you...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get down here, let me look. 594 00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,268 Don't move. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, stop. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Kenny, how are you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Don't judge me, but I'm about to get a tattoo. I call Kourtney. I really need someone's opinion on the tattoo 'cause I'm really getting nervous. I feel bad because, like, Dad doesn't know, and I'm trying to decide if I want it right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know it's exciting to do something so that you can show everyone. Like, that's what I did when I got my boobs done. Afterwards, I regretted it so much. If you're not positive, and you're not, like, 100%, then I say, don't do it right now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm so... This is so much harder than it seemed to be, like, a month ago. &gt;&gt; MARIO: If it doesn't feel right, then it doesn't feel right. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But I really like it. That's why I'm so confused. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a tattoo. It's there forever. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Love you, too. Bye. I think I'm going to... think about it, because I've wanted it for a while, and I know that, but now that I'm here, it actually feels really real to me, and it's freaking me out. &gt;&gt; MARIO: Yeah, yeah it's not just a thought. Now it's reality. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think it's a great idea for me to wait until I don't have to do it behind someone's back, because it will make me feel better about myself, and it will just not make me regret it later. Thank you so much for understanding. &gt;&gt; MARIO: Okay. You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I could have been sleeping right now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's so annoying. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Gabanna, come here. Gabanna! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're back. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. I want to be honest with my dad. I had the opportunity to get a tattoo, but I didn't. I hope my dad's impressed that I listened to him. Um, I... There was a tattoo place at the thing, so we went. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You better not have gotten a tattoo. Get down, get down here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, what are you...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get down here. Let me look. Don't move. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is it down lower? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Clean as a whistle. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Because of you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So why would you even go into a tattoo parlor? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause I wanted it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know I said no. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My dad is so pissed that I even went to a tattoo parlor that I think I'll wait a little while and let him cool off before I tell him about Vegas. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't ever go into a tattoo parlor again. Kind of ticks me off. She never should have been in the tattoo parlor in the first place. I think it's really important that we monitor this party very closely. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ki-lie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, why are you on the floor? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was just answering e-mails. &gt;&gt; ROB: On the floor? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Floor! I don't like to ruin my duvet... that you just sat... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, you guys have to swear you won't tell. I'm making Kendall this video montage of, like, pictures of us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's nice. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I am making a surprise video for my sister. I'm going to videotape all her friends saying happy birthday, and I know she'll love it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't heard back from Tyga yet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Work your magic. I need somebody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are turning into, like, a mini Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I was... I don't know... &gt;&gt; ROB: It's Kendall's sweet 16. We're going to make it happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys have all been on the Mom boat way too long. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ow! Ow! Help me! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow! Ow! 669 00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:14,479 Kylie, get out of my house now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How you doing? Good to see you. I'm hiring a security team to deal with any problems that we might have. I have my daughter's sixteenth birthday party. There's going to be seniors there, like, 18-year-old boys. I was an 18-year-old boy. I can remember the parties that we had. We did have a good time, but that's not going to happen here. I just want to make sure that there's no fooling around, certainly no drinking. &gt;&gt; GAL: As soon as they arrive, they're going to get under 21 wristband. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; GAL: We're going to be watching for the alcohol... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; GAL: ...for any weapons. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love that. Good. &gt;&gt; GAL: Then one undercover person by the restrooms. One undercover by the bar. And two undercovers by the kitchen, and there's an emergency exit that's going to be covered. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got it covered. This will be the most secure party I've ever seen in my life. I'm going to get there early, case the place out. &gt;&gt; GAL: Same here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. See you on the scene. Yeah! I don't think there's any way any of these kids can get away with anything at this party, and that's exactly the way I want it. How you guys doing tonight? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce needs to lighten up, because Kendall's going to be mortified. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My dad is making all my friends go through a metal detector. It's so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, look at my little baby. She was so cute and little. The cutout of my little daughter-- oh, my God, she was so cute back then. She's so cute now. But it's amazing. My whole life has revolved around my kids, and it's been fun to watch her grow up. &gt;&gt; GAL: Again Cedars-Sinai-- that's the closest hospital. We're going to have two cars. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Damn, this is the best-looking team I've ever seen. &gt;&gt; GAL: How are you, sir? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My gosh. How you guys doing tonight? Good. So, everything under control? I can go enjoy myself? &gt;&gt; GAL: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; GAL: That's what we're here for. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Thank you. &gt;&gt; GAL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Bruce can be a little bit of a crank bird. Do I have to go through that? Him being so paranoid over what these kids are going to do is over the top. Oh. &gt;&gt; MAN: I'm sorry, ma'am. No alcohol. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No alcohol? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce needs to lighten up, because Kendall's going to be mortified. I'm actually paying for the party, so I get to bring the champagne. I promise, it'll just be between you and I. &gt;&gt; MAN: Just between us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nobody's ever going to know the difference, I swear. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Look at your hair. Look how cute it is! &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Doesn't it look good? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you being serious that you think I'm going to keep it like this? &gt;&gt; WOMAN 3: It's nice. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Tonight is my big party, and I'm so excited. I'm kind of nervous, actually. I don't know what people are going to think. I just want to make sure everyone has fun. I could care less if I was sitting in a corner all night. I want everyone else to have fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! My baby made it! Sweet six... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Of course it's raining. Just my luck. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it wasn't a minute ago. It's only a little shower. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I walk in, and I see all these huge guys in black suits, and then, a huge metal detector, and I see my dad standing out here, and for sure, he has something to do with it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is Gal. He's head of security. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; GAL: Happy birthday. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Any problems, go to him. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm so upset that my dad is making all my friends go through a metal detector. It's so embarrassing. They're fine. Oh. I'm going through. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh. Back. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He's insane. He's treating my friends and I like we're hoodlums. Khloe! I heard some people, like, brought in, like, alcohol and stuff. I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: After going through security, me and my friends go up to our suite, and it's so amazing. After our party, we're just going to stay the night here, and it's going to be like a big slumber party. Okay... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And remember, girls... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Might stay here forever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...no boys down here later, okay? We will be checking in. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. My dad walks in, and it's kind of annoying. I feel like he's checking in on me 'cause he doesn't trust me. I don't know what to tell him, but I just want him to leave. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Be good. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: We will. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kendall! Hi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. Dad was being so annoying. He was making everybody line up and go through, like, a metal detector. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But a metal detector's one thing. I mean, it could have been way worse. You know what I mean? Like, standing there with his medal on and his shorts. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. Like, "Come on down. The sweet sixteen's happening. Don't you want to meet an Olympic athlete?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, guys, everyone has to have fun, and not one person make a complaint to Kendall, or I will personally stick my hand up your ass. Let's go have fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just couldn't help myself and I added a few touches. One of them is this amazing group called Lucient Dossier. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't even think my mom understands the words low-key, chill, and little, but it's so cool and amazing, it's a compromise between me and my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall set up a toy donation table at her party so her friends could bring gifts to donate to the children's hospital rather than bringing Kendall a present. &gt;&gt; GAL: Ready for this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What channel we on? &gt;&gt; GAL: 16. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you hear me? All right. You go that way, I'll go this way. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why do you have this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm helping with security. I got to keep an eye on these kids. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do you have earplugs? What's in your ear? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can talk to the security guys if I see anything. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, now my dad's gone way too far. He's thinking more about the security than my actual birthday. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can hear 'em in my ear. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you insane? It's over the top. He's making everyone extremely uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Trouble, trouble. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, baby. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know, I heard some people, like, brought in, like, alcohol and stuff, and I just don't want people having alcohol here, so, like, I don't know what to do. I hear from my friends that some people are trying to sneak in alcohol, and I don't want it to be that kind of thing, so I just want Khloe to be her funny self and do something about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone, pay attention. I did hear that some of you guys were trying to maybe have a sip of some alcohol, and I do want you guys... &gt;&gt; GUEST: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not a whoo. I do want you guys to know there's a lot of eyes on you guys. We do not condone underage drinking. It's my sister's sweet 16. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is good. Khloe's got my back. I love this-- Khloe is on the same page. Khloe, I want to thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. For what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: For having my back on the drinking thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're welcome, but actually Kendall's the one who told me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She said, "I heard a rumor that, you know, people might have alcohol here or try to get it, and I don't want to be, like..." She's like, "I don't want people thinking, like, I think that's cool." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cool, okay, good, I like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I definitely think Bruce is an amazing, amazing father, but I do think he needs to have a little more faith and trust in Kendall. You've got to give Kendall a little more credit. Like, all this security and police. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe the security was a little bit over the top. You know, I do feel a little bad that I even doubted her in the first place. &gt;&gt; KIM: What up, what up? This was Kylie's idea, Kendall, she's worked a really long time doing this, and she's really excited to show you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hit it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This little video comes on of, like, me at all my birthday parties and, like, little baby pictures of me, and I'm so surprised and it was so 849 00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:34,472 cute and so sweet of her to do. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow, that 16 years went by really, really fast. I can't believe you're all grown up, Kendall, and the images of you as a baby and all through your childhood-- I'm so proud that you're my daughter. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Everyone, silence. Kendall, happy birthday. Woman, you are amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I remember when Mom was pregnant with you, I was 16, and Kourtney and I would fight over who was going to be the better big sister, and, um, I hope I won. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can everyone come into the dance floor? We have another surprise. Where's the birthday girl? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Birthday girl to the center. Get up over here. I'd like to introduce... I was able to book a musical guest for Kendall. He is one of her favorite 867 00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:47,278 rappers and I'm really nervous. I hope she likes it. &gt;&gt; 871 00:40:56,721 --> 00:41:00,825 I'd like to introduce... Tyga! &gt;&gt; TYGA: Everybody, put your hands up like this... Yeah, yeah, come on, come on. &gt;&gt; CHRIS RICHARDSON: ♫ She's Far, far away ♫ &gt;&gt; TYGA: ♫ Yeah, like that Come on, come on Wave your hands like this ♫ &gt;&gt; RICHARDSON: ♫ And I'd do Anything ♫ &gt;&gt; TYGA: ♫ Come on, come on Wave your hands like this ♫ &gt;&gt; RICHARDSON: ♫ Just to see Her face ♫ &gt;&gt; TYGA: ♫ Sing it, sing it Right now she's... ♫ &gt;&gt; CROWD: ♫ Far, far away ♫ &gt;&gt; TYGA: ♫ Yo, walk A thousand miles ♫ Just to see her smile again Sittin' on a plane ♫ Reminiscin' back When I made a mistake I wish it never ended... ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, I cannot believe Tyga is at my party. His performance is great, everyone's dancing, everyone's having so much fun. You're leaving? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love you. Happy 16th. My ears are ringing, I cannot hear any longer, so I think it's time for me to leave. Have fun. Kendall has proved to me that she is really very trustworthy. She's a good kid, and I feel good about that. &gt;&gt; TYGA: Happy birthday, Kendall, on the count of three. One, two, three. &gt;&gt; CROWD: Happy birthday, Kendall! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The party was amazing. I had so much fun, I think everybody else did, too, and I honestly would not change a thing. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kendall! 903 00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:28,279 Kendall in the bubble! Kendall! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Do you have an appointment for the driving test? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Window number 12. Is your address still the same? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Put your right thumb and hold it. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: I'll show you ahead of time when to turn. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Pacing. Pacing. If she doesn't pass, I'm gonna have you take her driver's test for her. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right? 916 00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,260 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is that legal? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Just a couple things to go over. When you stop at red lights and you're turning right, it's part of the traffic check. Uh, take this into window number 12. They'll set you up with your temporary license at that window, and the actual license will be mailed in about two or three weeks. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I passed my test. Finally. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Finally. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am so excited. I can't believe I passed my test. I can drive. I can drive to school. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, here's the deal. There's the keys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thanks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's my fatherly talk. Are you ready? I hand you this car, you are responsible. This is the most responsibility you have ever taken, not only for you but for the other people in the car and the people around you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So you've got to take this seriously. But congratulations. Be careful, be safe. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bye, Dad, love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Be safe. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. It is kind of sad to watch your kids grow up. Her getting her driver's license, turning 16 is really that first big step of her getting the independence. That's sad, but it's part of life. She's turned out to be a great kid so far. I hope nothing but the best for her. 946
