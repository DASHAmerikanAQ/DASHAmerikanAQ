- &gt;&gt; MAN: All good, girls? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and Khloe and I are in San Francisco at the Sears head offices to meet with all of the people at Sears that we're going to be working with on our Kardashian Kollection. &gt;&gt; KIM: To be able to have a clothing line that is so stylish but have it be so affordable? That's like a dream come true for us. &gt;&gt; MAN: Everybody out there is so pumped. They are so excited. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, how many people are out there? &gt;&gt; MAN: I think probably about 150. What's the matter? You look a little funny to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, no. I'm so excited about this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We'll do the talking. &gt;&gt; GOODMAN: We have a little Q &amp; A here, so... Some of the group is going to ask some questions. &gt;&gt; BROCK: All of you have such distinct personalities. I was wondering how you define your own personal style? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're in front of the entire Sears corporate staff, and I don't even know what to say. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sorry, my sister is a little shy. It takes her a minute to warm up to people. &gt;&gt; KIM: I do appearances all the time, but if I'm put on the spot, I kind of freak out. Um... Um, I think that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just say it. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...you can definitely see, you know... Do I really have to go on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, you're cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The thing is that we all will have the same exact piece, but we'll wear it in so many different ways. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And also, we'll make tweaks so we all would love it and want to wear it, and I think that's what's really useful about us being in the stores, and being employees there for so long. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everything they said. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? Ooh, that bowl looks good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks. Mason's sleeping, so don't talk too loud. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You say that to me every time I walk into this house. How many hours can a little boy sleep? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He takes two naps a day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shh, Mason's asleep. Why does everyone come in here so noisy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott, it's like, 3:00. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know, thank God, I got done working early. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you done working at 3:00 in the afternoon? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: East coast time. Remember? &gt;&gt; KRIS: East coast...? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My office is on the East coast? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? So that means you've been working since 3:00 this morning? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 5:00 this morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you should maybe go back to work and get some more business done. Why don't you call Keith, I'm sure there's plenty of things to do for the rest of the day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't mind Kris trying to give me a hard time, if it was constructive criticism. But Kris has no idea what kind of businesses I'm running. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, what are you going to do? Lay by the pool and test out the tanning stuff? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna go see Mase. 64 00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,635 I don't need this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, he's sensitive. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, you have to film Khloe doing the splits. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all, I don't know how to do the splits. Second of all, I will break my vagina if I tried to do the splits. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. It's the booty-popping shaker! Whoo-hoo! Did Kim tell you about her, um, rendezvous with Prince? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Prince was like, "Yeah, man," like doing arm farts. And Kim stood there with her big, fat booty, and just stood there. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was at the Prince concert, and he brings me up on stage. And I freeze. And then, Prince says, "Get off the stage." I was so embarrassed. I'm not the best dancer, I don't like to dance in public. It's a weird thing. Like, I just don't like to dance. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What Kim should've done is... &gt;&gt; KIM: Let me... Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...pop that thing. You could've done that to Prince, you lame little whore. &gt;&gt; KIM: So close to him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't... just do a little move. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I don't dance. Like, I don't care. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim just isn't a dancer. She just is too serious about it, like... honestly, none of us are BeyoncĂŠ over here. We're not trying to be. So let's just, like, shake your booty and just like... fake it till you make it. Who cares? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's it, shake it, shake it, shake it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going to throw up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow, you stepped on my footie. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom will kill me that I scratched the floor. Gotta go now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're such a fraidy cat! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ken, how was New York? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It was fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Were you sad that you didn't go, Kyles? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I don't care. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love New York, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, you look... dashing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They don't call me the Dapper Don Disick for no reason. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No one calls you the Dapper Don Disick. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. But it would be nice. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my gosh, you know what Mom did to me the other day? She left me at a photo shoot for 12 hours. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who was there with you at your photo shoots? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No one. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Obviously your mom loves you guys more than anything, but she's so busy with everybody else, and we all know her attention goes to the number one breadwinner. And that's Kim. You guys need to be taken care of better than that. I'd kill it for these two. They're the stars in this family, not you guys. You guys are getting old and washed. These are the breadwinners. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kendall and Kylie could probably be bigger stars than anybody, but I just don't feel like they're getting the attention they deserve, because Kris is so busy with the older ones. You need somebody who's hands-on, cares about you, and is involved in everything. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So you're saying I should fire my mom and hire you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, that would work out well. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whatever, let's just see how she reacts. We'll just say that I'm taking them under, and I'm going to represent them, and see if she freaks out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So are you doing it as a joke or you want to manage them? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A little of both. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does that sound good to you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm at least caring! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It sounds fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe she needs a scare, and then she can start being better with all of us. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't forget, when you get home, say, "Mom. We don't need any more help, because Scott Disick's going to be managing us." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Now get out of here. Our work's done here. This is going to be funny, man. Your mom's going to freak out. &gt;&gt; MAN: You moved into the house, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; How is it? Nice? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. It's just, like, going to take five more years to get it together. &gt;&gt; MAN: I'm sure. I'm sure. &gt;&gt; RYAN SEACREST: Please welcome Kim and Kourtney Kardashian. &gt;&gt; ELLEN K: Kim. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Hello. The queen has arrived. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney and I are here to talk to Ryan Seacrest. We haven't talked to him in a while, so we're just going to catch up on everything. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Now, Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes? &gt;&gt; RYAN: What can you tell us about your relationship that seems to be heating up? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, it's going really, really good. He makes me just happy, and smile, and laugh, all the time. He's really funny. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Look at this smile! Oh, it's so cute! &gt;&gt; RYAN: Uh, now, what happened on stage with Prince? &gt;&gt; KIM: It is so embarrassing when Ryan brings up the YouTube video of me not dancing on stage with Prince. I swear, I'm never going to dance again. This is going to haunt me forever. I was just so nervous, and I'm just laughing. To my defense, like, didn't he Dancing with the Stars? Like, I am not a dancer. I have no idea how I did Dancing with the Stars. Everyone was like, it'll be so much fun! No, it's not fun. And I remember going backstage after every dance, crying. Just like hoping I would get kicked off. Look, I'm just not a dancer. I'm like petrified of dancing. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah, you-you were nervous, you froze up a little bit. &gt;&gt; KIM: I, yeah, I did. But I was like, I'm... it's Prince, you know? So... &gt;&gt; RYAN: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I said, that's, like, your chance, to, like, get on the stage, whip your hair around, and go nuts. &gt;&gt; KIM: And humiliate myself in Madison Square Garden. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is a perfectionist. So she does care about how people perceive her. She doesn't want to just embarrass herself. &gt;&gt; RYAN: You should have put your hips against his and you should have felt the purple rain. &gt;&gt; ELLEN K: Oh, Ryan. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There you go, babe. I made dinner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, seriously, did you think there were 75 of us? This is a lot of food. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're the one who ordered it. I just picked it up. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie and I have been trying to establish the perfect time to tell my mom that Scott's going to be our new manager. And she's just had her first glass of wine, so I'm thinking it's go time. Um, Kylie, should we tell Mom about that thing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What thing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What thing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The Scott thing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hold my hand. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I wanted to let you know that you'll always be my mom, but sometimes people will fire a manager. So we'd like you to know that, um... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're hiring me? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Scott. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me a really good reason. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 'Cause you are too caught up with Kim. And he's creative. He can come up with cool ideas. He cares about us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, I think this may not be a bad idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you insane? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I mean, I give Scott a lot of credit-- he stopped drinking, he's been a great dad to Mason. He's made some major changes in his life and this nothing but a good sign. They need full-time management. You're like, part-time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, come on, you guys. This is like a big fat joke. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, let's have a vote. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Scott. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott. I got with the vote. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Whoo. That means... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Three to one. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...you're ruled out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott-- three to one. &gt;&gt; KYLIE/KENDALL/BRUCE: Scott, Scott, Scott... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I've had enough of this nonsense. You guys better be kidding me right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A new manager. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you guys aren't kidding, this will be the last time you mutter the word Scott. Scott is not going to manage anybody. Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, it's Kris. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know, I have caller ID. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Well, I'm having dinner with Kendall and Kylie right now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that's fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. It's really fun over here. They're telling me that you want to be their new manager. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. I just figured you didn't have the time for them and, you know, your attention is with the older girls, so I figured I'd make them some money. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you think you should have talked to me about this first? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's a joke, by the way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a joke? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. We know he can't really be our manager. It's kind of like to make Mom mad. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's funny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's funny about making Mom mad? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I kinda have to run, but if you want, let's schedule a time to sit down and talk about it like real people. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really thought Scott knew me well enough by now to know that you don't mess with my family and you definitely don't mess with my business. Scott, this is no joke. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, gotta go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? He hung up on me. Tomorrow morning I'm going to go over there and kick his ass. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: We're going to focus on being in front of other people. Seven, eight... &gt;&gt; KIM: This is one of the most humiliating experiences of my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You think that you could take over Kendall and Kylie without even discussing it with me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You seem all worked up. 258 00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,915 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll show you worked up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What the hell do you think you're doing? Calling Kendall and Kylie and making them think that you can actually be their manager. It's really shady for you to think that you could take over Kendall and Kylie without even discussing it with me. That's the shadiest thing I've ever seen you do yet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You seem all worked up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Worked up? I'll show youworked up. Don't get me started. It's not funny. I have had it up to here with Scott Disick. I've worked too hard. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're getting nuts over something you don't even know about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I'm getting nuts. Yeah, really? I don't know about? I know everything there is to know about my children. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, you're coming over here like a crazy animal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What about if we told you it was ajoke? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's no joke. My kids are no joke. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was a joke! The whole thing. I wasn't going to actually manage them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The whole thing is a joke? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes, and look at you. You fell right into it. You're like an animal. They came to me complaining, saying that you're neglecting them and you spend all your time with the older girls. That's all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think if I was having a problem with me, that you would be the one to go running to. That you were going to come in and save the day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, maybe you don't get it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at you. This is what you do during the day? You lay in the sun and you tan? The only joke is that you think that you could be their manager. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This started as a practical joke, but she, of course, starts saying things that are completely hurtful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The only problem I have right now, Scott, is you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course. That's been your problem for the last couple years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So get out of my house then if I'm such a problem. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Five. Count 'em, five. 300 00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,105 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm pretty sure we took your key back for a reason. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hey. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Against my better judgment, I decide to secretly take this dance class and learn a few dance moves. So in case this ever happens again, I'll at least have something to do. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: All right, guys. Jazz-funk. Just like simple moves, okay? Okay, so let's just get started. All right, so you're pushing out with your left hand, and you're pushing away with your body. There's two. So it's eight, one... Five, six, seven, eight, one, uh, two, three, hit, four. &gt;&gt; KIM: Every single person in this class can dance ten times better than I ever could. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Around, pop. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't even understand what the dance teacher is saying. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Nice work you guys. Okay, so we're going into groups of two so that we can really focus on being in front of other people. So everyone else can kind of like circle around. Group one, just give it a shot. Seven, eight, one, uh, two, three, four, five, six, step, seven, back, eight, one. Good. Two... All right, next group please. Eight, one, uh, two, three, four, five, six, step, seven, back, eight, one. Good. Next group. &gt;&gt; MAN: Come on, Kim. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Let's go, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I swear, I don't even remember it. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Here we go. Eight, one, uh, two, three, four, six, step, seven, back, eight. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is probably one of the most humiliating experiences of my life. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't remember it. I'll just watch. It was actually more fun to be kicked off stage by Prince than it is to sit and be humiliated in this dance class. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Eight, one, uh, two, four, five, six, step, seven, back, eight. &gt;&gt; MAN: Beautiful, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi! &gt;&gt; MAYTE: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? I'm having lunch with Mayte. She's a good friend of mine. I've known her since I was, like, 19 years old. And she's also Prince's ex-wife, so she can understand my pain. I want to kill your ex-husband. He was like, "Get off the stage!" &gt;&gt; MAYTE: He was probably just kidding. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wish it wasn't in front of, like, however bazillion people. &gt;&gt; MAYTE: Yeah, that's... that's kind of bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then on YouTube. &gt;&gt; MAYTE: Oh, no. Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAYTE: What I don't get is how you can do red carpets. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is so different, 'cause I'm me; I'm not, like, being something that I'm not. I really just have, like, a fear of doing anything like performing in public. &gt;&gt; MAYTE: You know what? It's not true, 'cause I see you in photo shoots, and when you're being, like, sexy and stuff like that, that's the exact same thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; MAYTE: Yeah, it is. It is. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wouldn't even dance at home, though, in my bedroom. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; MAYTE: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: No way. I just don't like it. Who I am inside... &gt;&gt; MAYTE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...is so opposite than what people would assume. It, like, terrifies me. &gt;&gt; MAYTE: We got to fix that. You can't, like... you know, you're in the public eye, and, like, you're out there and you have to, like, just open up and feel free. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, the more Mayte kind of explains to me and breaks it down, like, I'm so tired of my shyness holding me back from having fun. You have to take risks, and you have to try things that are outside of your comfort zone. &gt;&gt; MAYTE: I have fear of photographers; you have fear of performing. I think we should both walk out and you should dance. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, right. And then you have to, like, pretend like you're walking a runway and doing a red carpet in front of all of those photographers. &gt;&gt; MAYTE: No. Oh, God, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That doesn't go in there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course it does. It's the towel drawer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got to tell your mom to stop coming over here uninvited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, no. Why would I? You just try to annoy her on purpose. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I don't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys were getting along. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Maybe you think we were getting along. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you not? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. There's nothing nice about her attitude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know what is going on with Scott. He was in such a good place with my mom. I don't know why he won't just say he's sorry and move on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What more can I do to please this woman? She's not even my mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Instead of doing these crazy pranks on her and stuff, you should just tell her like a normal person, and then maybe she'll be fine and get it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Every time I feel like I take a step forward, your mom makes me feel like I took a step backwards. It's not fun for me. It's difficult. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Just, you need to call my mom and talk to her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's soup. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm trying to push you to be the best that you can be. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think maybe you need some work on what you do to push people. &gt;&gt; KIM: Should I go now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, come on! 401 00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,680 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kitchen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's up? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's it going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Pretty good. I'm just going over some menus. What's up? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. I just feel like... this whole thing has gotten so out of hand. Me playing what I thought was a practical joke on you obviously went completely the wrong direction, and you know, I never meant for... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, how would you think that that would be such, like, a good idea? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Part of me did kind of want to get under your skin, but by no means did I think you were going to get that upset and then, you know, strike back and say kind of hurtful things to me such as my work ethic and... Just feels like, no matter what, you're, like, always raring to get after me if I give you that opportunity. I care what you think of me, and when I hear you say those things, it upsets me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know I don't feel that way about you at all anymore. I mean, I... I feel bad that I said something that was kind of below the belt, because I'm trying to push you to be the best that you can be. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, I think maybe you need some work on what you do to push people into the right direction-- let's just say that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I'll... I'll work on that. I shouldn't have said that, and I'm sorry I said that stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It is what it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But we just have to get past it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I apologize for getting you upset. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You apologize? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I am sorry. I wasn't looking to get you upset. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so happy he came over to apologize. We've come so far. It was unnecessary to take 172 steps back. Did I hear that? You just apologized? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes, I said sorry. I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, come here! Give me a hug! 437 00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,938 I love, "I'm sorry." No more funny jokes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. The family and I are going to Carousel Restaurant. It's our favorite Armenian restaurant. We come here all the time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Does anybody know what's in any of this stuff? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Uh-uh. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you guys sad that Scott's not your manager? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your mom really was ready to kill me. Like, literally, like, go to jail, throw away the key, lock her up. She didn't care. You can still call me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, sexy girls! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. Are they all Armenian? &gt;&gt; KIM: We can find Rob a girlfriend here. 452 00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:17,249 Rob, what do you think of the brunette one? &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, come on! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's Armenian. He's got to go. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's got to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, he's not doing it. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, no, no, no! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go, Kim! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go! &gt;&gt; KIM: Should I go now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go! Kim, she's terrified. Like, she's about to pee on herself. Kim, come on! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You are so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so over this being shy and not being confident. What do I care if this restaurant sees me dancing on stage? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on! &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, fine. I'm not afraid! &gt;&gt; DANCER: ...your knees. And then you go... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; DANCER: Shimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay, Kimmy! Whoo! &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm glad that Kim has this confidence, but this is definitely not her, like, talent in life. She should get off the stage and put the red flags down. But at least she's getting wild and having fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did such a good job, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't have stage fright. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: I would be really helpful if you get rid of this crease. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't like a lot of things about my body. &gt;&gt; KOURNTEY: You should've been working out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I didn't. Shoot me. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're in Bora-Bora! I'm so excited that Kris is coming on the trip. It's too hot. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: They're all going to be hot. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a huge test to our relationship. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're crazy.
