- &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you ever used a condom? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think I'm the biggest whore you have in your family? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, but you're the only one I can talk to about this stuff. Like, who puts it on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The guy should have enough manners to put his own condom on his own &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's a reservoir tip? What does that even mean? : Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There you go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Khloe, you got condom juice... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ion your shirt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...all over my shirt! Does this stuff stain? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, it's lubrication. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How am I gonna explain this? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: What is that drink? 'Cause you had it last time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Avocado and milk... &gt;&gt; BRUNO: All right, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and, like, two little teaspoons of sugar. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: How many calories? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I have it every morning. It's like pudding. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: It looks healthy; you had it last time. It looks like pudding. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Khloe said it was gross. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: It looks like, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Pea soup. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: So, this morning, Tara will give you a little bit of a recap on the PR, just over the last month, and what's coming up. &gt;&gt; TARA: So July is obviously a really big month for Kardashian Kids, in particular. We're launching in Australia, Big W, and Khloe's coming out to Australia. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Second year in a row, kids. &gt;&gt; BRUNO: It's your turn next, miss. It's your turn. That's it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll go, but I said I just have a lot of baggage I have to bring. I have a breast-feeding baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No kids and I still cover the kids' department. I am gonna be going to Australia by myself to launch Kardashian Kids. It's gonna be intense. There's gonna be three straight 12-hour interview days, press junkets, meet and greets. &gt;&gt; TARA: It's gonna be really interactive. We're gonna have a little photo booth set up with, like, little props that they can use. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So cute. And I am picking up the slack for my sisters. They have so much going on in their personal lives, and apparently I don't, so two straight years, me in Australia. &gt;&gt; TARA: So this is the catering menu. There's a couple options, so if you guys want to let us know your thoughts? &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo, do you want the avocado or the cheeseburgers? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you going to this? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So why are you picking the food? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is that juice, Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Erewhon. And they're really good for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think this is giving me life, 'cause I was, like, about to faint. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Had I known you guys were into the juice, we could've joined a cooking class. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What does that have to do with anything? &gt;&gt; KIM: So I just went over my house stuff, and... guess who has to move out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye and I are in the final stages of our construction on our home... ...and they've advised us that we should move out so that they can do our bedroom and our bathrooms now. Do you want a roommate? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would have to make a run for it. Sayonara! &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe we could move into Kylie's new place for, like, a little bit? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I would seriously stab myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Come on, Kylie. I would do it for you. I'm gonna ask Kanye if he's into that idea. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Nobody is staying at my house. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know why they're being so rude and dramatic. Like, I'm pregnant, they should want to, like, cater to a pregnant woman. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe I'll go to Europe for a month. Pretend like I'm Parisian. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you ever, in your life, met a more annoying person? Can you imagine what your life would be like with six torturous kids? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's Mase! &gt;&gt; MASON: Can I go first? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to put you second, 'cause I was here first, so I already put my name first. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you erase something? I hate this thing! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, but why are we all on the same team? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you asking me so many questions? &gt;&gt; MASON: I really want to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have to wait till she enters in our names. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Almost... there we go! &gt;&gt; MASON: There we go! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We did it, Mase! &gt;&gt; MASON: Oh, yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who is supposed to be "Kok"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Cock"? "Kokes." But we... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It just says K-O-K. No bueno. Good luck, Mase. Yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; MASON: Good job! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good job. &gt;&gt; KIM: When is Scott coming back? Is he gonna be back before Saturday? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's in Europe? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Even though Scott and Kourtney are broken up, I'm really worried he's gonna do whatever he can to get back with Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's going on with him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm, nothing. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I really think that Kourtney's had it, so I don't think that she would... necessarily get back with him, but there's always that possibility and that just worries me, 'cause he can't just go, do what he wants to do and then come back when he wants to come back. I hope that she just holds her ground, 'cause it's not gonna help anyone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Down the middle, Mase! &gt;&gt; KIM: I think my stomach popped yesterday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are your jeans buttoned? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you wearing maternity jeans now? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think it's time to start. Mase! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my gosh, you did it! &gt;&gt; MASON: Uh-huh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who are you FaceTiming? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruiser. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Hi, there! There you are! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why won't you respond to my text messages? Are you mad at me? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Huh? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why won't you respond to my text... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Now, hold on a second. I thought I did... I didn't see something. I'm gonna look and I will respond. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get so insecure when you don't respond to me. I think, like, you're mad, and I didn't even do anything. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I sincerely apologize. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Okay. &gt;&gt; CANDIS: Hi, gorgeous! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; CANDIS: You look super cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, so do you. Look at the cutest one of them all. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Is that Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yep. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Oh, I can do that, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: All right, I will check for your text. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Good-bye. I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye, love you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Bye, Kourt. Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye. Love you, bye. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN and CANDIS: Bye! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw, I love everyone. So I'm going to Australia on Monday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Monday? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. And I was thinking, we don't want to, like, throw off our whole workout routine, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was thinking you should come to Australia with me and be my workout buddy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't want to go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I was thinking about it for a second, and then... I just feel like I need to stay home. I know that Khloe really wants me to go to Australia with her, but I really don't want to go without my kids. They need me now more than ever, and to leave for a week would just be irresponsible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This whole event is to launch, like, Kardashian Kids in Australia, so I think having three little munchkins probably is a great, like, walking... ...bonus. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... I just don't want people to ask me annoying questions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know Caitlyn told me that how you get a penis, they make it your clit? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Why are you having these conversations with her? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's so weird. So they get rid of the penis and leave just a little bit of it? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: There you are! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have to hold this. Hey, gorg! &gt;&gt; CANDIS: Hi, gorgeous! &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: What's up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wanted to remember, how do make aon a girl? &gt;&gt; CANDIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was trying to tell Malika. You told me, on a girl, to transition, is they use the clit, right? &gt;&gt; CANDIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you still keep, like, the hole, I guess? &gt;&gt; CANDIS: I think they close it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You told me they kept it. Why would you have the best of both worlds? That's unfair. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You're not thinking of getting one, are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have a pretty big set of balls already, so, you know. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Okay. Love you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that's too much for you? Really? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: It's about all I can handle. Okay, bye! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I can't. &gt;&gt; GPS VOICE: Hazardous driving conditions on the U.S. 101 southbound. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, bitch. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up. No. Are you excited to go to Australia? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I am. I actually like the flight though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you get to sleep the whole time. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone keeps asking, like, why doesn't Kourt go? All this stuff. You know, she's just overwhelmed and blah, blah, blah with everything, and I totally get it. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Kim and Kourtney have both been very busy on the baby-making front. And unfortunately, that has really changed the circumstances for who travels to work and who doesn't. And I think Khloe's a real trouper when it comes to holding it down for her sisters on the work front. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're gonna be there for a week. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's crazy, 'cause it doesn't seem like it's gonna be a week, but it... 'Cause it's really, like, one day travel there and then one day travel back, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; GPS VOICE: Head south on Sepulveda Boulevard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, bitch, on my old car, no one ever spoke to me! Stop talking to me, or we're getting a new car. You're short. You're, like, just an inconvenience, you dumb whore! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This looks so crazy. It makes it, like, a flakey croissant pancake thing. Do you really want the avocado thing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh. This is so good. &gt;&gt; KIM: You drink it or you eat it with a spoon? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I eat it with a spoon. You kind of have to, like, get used to it though. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, warm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like it like that, but that's how I'm used to eating it, but we could put it in the fridge for a while, and you can have it later. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I mean, it's really good. So what's going on... with Scott? Do you have, like, a plan, like, with the kids or anything? Or is it just, like, whenever? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just want to keep it, like, as normal for them as possible. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But, like, I just know that the way things... were, if he just, like, moved back here, it would just be the same. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like he had fun, and then once, like, reality set in, he was like, "Oh," &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but I feel like that's kind of what happens every time. Like, he would be home and be really good for, like, three months, and then go out of town, and then be, like, worse than he was, you know, before. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, each time, it would get worse and worse. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And so... &gt;&gt; KIM: And you don't have time for that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. He has, like, two personalities. That's the hard thing. It's like he wants both. He's like, "I just want my family," or whatever, and I'm just like, "Well, what are you doing to try to change your life?" There's just a lot that would have to happen... &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...for him to, like, get on a good path. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, and it would definitely be a process. Do you think you would ever, like, forgive him and get back with him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... I feel like right now... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying to find the keys to my car. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am, like, in shock. I haven't seen him in so long. He obviously spent the night, and Kourtney didn't mention that he was there. Wait, a Range Rover key? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, do you have it? &gt;&gt; KIM: I saw it right there. If-if it's yours. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've never heard so muchnoise in one house. &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought Kourtney was, like, really strong and firm, and now, like, are they back together? What is he...? Like, I just don't understand. Is that it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott. It's interesting to me that Scott is texting me now. "I really want to talk to you about everything when you can." I love going to these places. I don't mind the work. But you guys all have families and kids. I have no friends anymore, because I've done too many jobs. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying to find the keys to my car. I've never heard so much noise in one house. Kourt, do you know where this key went? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, no. Is it in the car maybe? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, it was outside. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was outside the car, and now it's... That scaffolding noise is insane, by the way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're putting up the mirrors. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, do you think he heard me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why was he...? I didn't know he was here. What if he thinks I was, like, talkingabout him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, he doesn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was so awkward. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, hello. Are we going to, like, a green room real quick? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yes, we are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; MAN: And then we'll go into the event. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Perfect. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: I want to introduce you all to Khloe Kardashian. Over to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. I just wanted to say thank you, guys, so much for coming here today and celebrating with us our launch for Kardashian Kids. My sisters are sorry they couldn't be here. It's always an excuse. One has a baby, and one's pregnant, so... ...it's me, I'm here! I just landed in Australia, and all I know is that I hit the ground running and I'm gonna be working for three straight days. Nice to see you. Hi. Jet lag is slowly kicking in, but personally I'm so grateful for everyone that's here, appreciating and accepting our line and wanting it and just really being so excited about it that it gives me the second wind. Kardashian Kids is now available in stores and online only at the Big W. &gt;&gt; DIRECTOR: Great, doing great, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What was the competition? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I had to write in 25 words where would I take you in Australia. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I said, "I'll take you to cuddle a koala..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: "...and cackle with a kookaburra." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know that koalas have chlamydia? I have been to the zoo here, and I was like, "Oh, my God, we're gonna hold koalas," and they said, "You can't, 'cause they have chlamydia." It's like, "off, they don't have an STD," but they do. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It's... they're gross. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nasty little animals. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is this salad? It smells so good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Avocado and beans and chicken and tomato and cheese. So, in two weeks are you looking forward to getting new roommates? &gt;&gt; KRIS: New roommates? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. Me, Kanye, North. Just three. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you kidding? The last time Kim told me she was moving in for a couple of months, it stretched into almost two years. She completely took over my whole house. &gt;&gt; KIM: This one has a lock on it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, who's got the key? &gt;&gt; KIM: I do. Why would you have the key to my diamonds? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is my closet. I'm thinking to myself, "Oh, here we go again." You know what people ask me? "Are you sad that your kids have all left the nest?" And I said, "I'll let you know if they ever leave." I can't believe I'm saying this, but fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: This time, it's only till December 1... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're staying for six months?! &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not six months, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's five months. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It'll never be five months. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is, Mom, it is, because I'm having the baby, and I cannot... &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what you said the last time, and you gave birth at my house! Help me! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's only 5:50. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: For us, it's actually, like, 1:00 a.m. You've had a very, very long day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. on a &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Either you're funny or I'm really delirious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think you're just really... 'cause I don't think I'm that funny. I don't really know what's happening. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Your random spurts of, like, um... What do they call it? What's that disease called when people, like...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tourette's? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yes. You have randy... random spurts of Tourette's. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Randy? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Randy! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott. "Wow, I can't believe I've been writing your old number. Kourtney's told me about this new number, and now I see we actually did text. I'm sure I was not in the right frame of mind. I really want to talk to you about everything when you can." I haven't spoken to Scott in about a month, and it's interesting to me that he's texting me now. I mean, my last text from him is me reaching out to him, and then it just goes dead for about a month. Kourtney, do you want me to talk to him? I don't feel comfortable responding to him until I talk to Kourtney and see what she wants me to say. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You have to reward some good behavior. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't seen good behavior yet, 'cause he wants to talk. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, I know. But in, you know, taking responsibility for not trying to communicate? At least it's the truth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's been a long time since I've been here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, they have pad Thai. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to order, Mom? Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I get the Dim Sum and Then Some? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I'll get the Chinese chicken salad, and then I'll get the pad Thai, and then the chicken pot stickers... &gt;&gt; WAITER: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and then shrimp fried rice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I start eating like you, I'm gonna look like I'm pregnant. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I've been, like, acting a little bit more interested in Kourtney's whole, like, organic pregnancy stuff, just so I can kind of, like, keep an eye on her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a good idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just to make sure she's okay, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: But then the other day, I was there and I was talking to Kourtney about Scott, and I was like, "So what are you gonna do? What are the rules gonna be? What are this, what are that?" and then he just walks out, like, of the other room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He was there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. He was fully there. It was clear he spent the night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I was like... it was so awkward. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I learned the hard way, because I've been through being divorced, basically, when I had little kids. And you have to put the kids first. You just have to... &gt;&gt; KIM: She does. No, she totally does. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, but I mean, it can't be about her and it can't be about him, and I think she's handling it really well. I think they just have to really focus on... making sure the kids don't feel... you know, abandoned by anybody. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I think regardless of Scott and Kourtney being together, Scott will always be in our lives. I mean, he's the father of my nephews and my niece. We want him healthy and happy, so that he can be in their lives as much as possible. But I still want Kourtney to figure it out and be strong and not get back together with him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just organizing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's racks of clothes and shoes. She is going to have every corner of my house. Well, I hope you remember, when I'm 85 years old... &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't take over your whole house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and I'm senile and I have nowhere to live. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Didn't Kimberly just go to Paris? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. But she can't come here to do this. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe puts herself on the back burner. I think it's unfair she has to do things alone. You're more exhausted than you normally would be because you're doing all this by yourself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm normally doing this by myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: This rack is my mom's. I'm not this unorganized. We should maybe move them, so that my mom has as much room for all of her stuff as possible. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just organizing my stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is it all in the garage? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because you don't use this garage, and I thought that I would not take up an extra bedroom, and I would just have all my stuff right here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my goodness. The takeover has begun. There's racks of clothes and shoes and bags. She is going to have every corner of my house. Well, I hope you remember all of this and how you took over my entire house, when I'm 85 years old... &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't take over your whole house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and I'm senile and I have nowhere to live. Wow. What did I get myself into? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: How you feeling? You okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I just don't like rushing. &gt;&gt; JEN: You need to recheck your... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My vagina? My camel toe? Listen, a girl's got a puffy , remember that. &gt;&gt; JEN: It's a good opener. It's an icebreaker. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today is a major press junket day. I have about 60-something different media outlets that I'm meeting with. &gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER: Khloe, welcome back to Sydney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER: It's great to have you here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. I love being here. &gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER 2: Before we get started, just want to say, I shoot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. It was terrifying, but a lot of fun to do. Yeah. Doing these by myself, picking up the slack for my sisters, I mean, it's intense, but you just got to plaster a smile on your face, ignore the jet lag and keep it pushin'. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Can I get you anything? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm good. &gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER 3: Hi, Khloe. Thank you so much for meeting with us. you. &gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER 3: What's the best thing about working with your sisters? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's crazy, 'cause they say you should never work with family, but I would not know how to work with anybody else. We trust each other. Like, Kourtney is breast-feeding and can't travel with all of her kids, and Kim's pregnant, so they of course trust me to be here. It's a big responsibility. &gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER 3: It is. &gt;&gt; JEN: Two more and then lunch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER 3: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You're almost done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You're such a sport. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Malika. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe is a people pleaser. She'll do anything to please her sisters. But I think the workload's a little excessive, and it's only set up this way because it's intended to be spread across three people. &gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER 4: What's been your favorite look of 2015? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, 'cause I can't think about anything. This is when I wish one of my sisters were here, 'cause we always, like, answer for each other. &gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER 4: Amazing. That's me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Mmm, something smells good. Hey there, hi there, ho there. So what was your favorite part about today's interviews? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, Malika. Just, like, repetitive. I'm like, can we just all sit in one room, guys? &gt;&gt; JEN: So many people today though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So many people. But I'm like, I don't even know what we're talking about anymore. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You're more exhausted than you normally would be, because you're doing all of this by yourself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm normally doing this by myself. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe, over and over again, pretty much puts herself on the back burner when it comes to work with her sisters. And I think it's unfair that she has to do things alone. She needs to put herself as a priority, and she can't do that unless she has help from them. Didn't Kimberly just go to Paris? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm. Mm-hmm. But she can't come here to do this. &gt;&gt; JEN: Do you want them to come with you? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Of course she does, but she's, like, a super sister. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do all the work and we split all the money. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: What if you just said no? What if you were just like, "You know what? I can't make it." Have you ever even said anything? Just saying, "You know what, you guys? I've pulled up for you now. I'm just hoping that when it's my turn, you guys will do it for me." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You talk to them, Malika. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'd be happy to, but I think it would be better to come from you. I love you to pieces. You should talk to your sisters. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, were these your gold things? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. The same ones though. So, of course that means she took the whole thing, what I was doing, which I don't mind, but ask me for my marble. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm. How long are you staying here? &gt;&gt; KIM: Till probably, like, the first week of December. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? I thought you were here for, like, a week. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm here till December. What was Scott doing at the house the other day? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He said he wanted to check into a rehab and they didn't have, like, a private room until that day. &gt;&gt; KIM: But he's out at the club last night, partying? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So he was like, "Do you mind if I stay there? I'll stay down in the guest room. Just 'cause I can't be in my house alone; it's, like, not good for me." And so then he was at the house, and I just so saw how his brain works, for the first time. Like, he just, like, convinces himself of why he needs to go out. He, like... to make himself feel okay, he makes the excuse me. You know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. That's so wrong. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, he's like, "I want to kill myself from being in this room." But it was just... it made it so clear that no matter what I do, or don't do, like, he uses... he'll make anything into an excuse. And I just don't need that around us right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel really relieved that Kourtney doesn't want that toxic part of their relationship in her life anymore. Right now, she's really strong and in a good place and she's realized that she will be better off and happier this way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All, like, the help and protecting we try to do for these guys, like, it's just not helpful. You know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, totally. &gt;&gt; MAN: It's such a fabulous evening, ladies and gentlemen. Up the bum, no babies! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Up the bum, no babies! Yeah! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The whole thing was an open-door policy, and now I go, and she's like, "Don't let him in the house." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like I'm missing a piece of the story. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; TERESA: I'm Teresa. So nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe. Nice to meet you. Can he take a picture with you guys? We've had such a crazy trip. So much work. I am fully exhausted right now, but Malika found this drag show, and I feel like I owe it to her to let loose and have fun. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Want to do a shot? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: We are going to do shots with Khloe. Wet! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wet? I don't know what that is! Do I have a wet? &gt;&gt; MAN: Up the bum, no babies! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Up the bum, no babies! Yes! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Khloe, yes! &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome to Stonewall Hotel. It's such a fabulous evening. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you guys so much. This was the best part of my trip! I am having the best time. Shots, drag queens. Like, it's just super-fun. And I think I need this sometimes for my soul. &gt;&gt; JEN: I mean, honestly, that was the funnest thing we'll ever do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Malika had a really good point. I'm the last one to take time for myself or take time off work, but I'm so happy Malika made me. Now I get these memories of being in Australia, going to a drag show, and having the best time. &gt;&gt; JEN: Oh, I love you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's 5:02, you guys, and we are... &gt;&gt; MEN: Turnt up! &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you have mascara? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: What, 'cause I'm using your mascara? Get a life. I have these videos on my phone of Mason teaching North how to ballroom dance, and he put on a prince costume, and he made North wear a crown. It was so funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you talked to Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I do. She just seems like it's, like, frustrating, but she's gonna get through. I think she knows, like, what can she do with Scott, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I just feel like, I mean, for me, I'm trying to be there for her, but in ways... Like, she calls me, like, right before the weekend, and she says, you know... &gt;&gt; KIM: She doesn't have a nanny on the weekends. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, so she said, "Can you babysit Saturday?" And I'm like, "Oopsy, photo shoot." I mean, Corey will help her. So she was like, "Okay." And I just feel like the only thing I know to do is just to be there... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...for her, but I don't really know how she's honestly feeling inside, because she doesn't stop long enough to talk about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I know this sounds crazy, 'cause you guys think I'm nuts if I... if I have any compassion for the person on the other side, but I worry about him, too, because I'm sure he's struggling and feels horrible, and he's in a place where he probably doesn't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KIM: He was the one that up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, he's definitely in the doghouse, but I'm more worried right now about three little kids under the age of five. I'm gonna reach out to him. I think I'm gonna reach out. I'm just gonna pop him a text and say, "Hey, how are you?" I really want to have a conversation with Scott. I want him to find himself. I want him to be a better person for himself and for nobody else, so that he can be a great dad to those kids, because he loves them and they love him, and he just needs to focus on his family. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wish she would move on from him. I'm over him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm supposed to go out to lunch with Scott, and I just wanted to make sure that I had your blessing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at the moon. Or is that the sun? Uh, I feel like I'm in Africa. Malika, look. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah, it's stunning. &gt;&gt; JEN: The sun's over here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, right. I know where my things are. What are those, planets? &gt;&gt; JEN: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, what are we doing? &gt;&gt; JEN: Ooh, look at that fire. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's to light the balloon, you idiot! &gt;&gt; JEN: Oh, my God, there's the balloon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's from gas. We've had such a crazy trip. So much work. And I'm not gonna be in Australia often, even though I love it here... This is so cool. ...so I decided to stay an extra day and take Malika and Jen up in a hot air balloon ride to do something that's peaceful and beautiful. Something that we will remember forever. &gt;&gt; GUIDE: All right, here we go. &gt;&gt; WOMEN: Bye! &gt;&gt; GUIDE: Here we go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop playing on your phone and look at this. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; GUIDE: See the Sydney skyline? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: This is so insane, you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, look how crazy... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so cool. You know, I've been on one before. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh,you. Okay, you are... Suck my Bye. Being up in this hot air balloon, it does give you time to reflect, and I do think when I get back home, I want to talk to Kourtney and Kim. I want to play fair, but I want my sisters to pull the same share of the weight that I pull. But just because I don't have a child doesn't mean I don't need "me time" to enjoy my life a little more. You guys, I'm so excited about today. &gt;&gt; JEN: That's a nice change of attitude. Do you think Matt's ever peed outside of that thing? When he's up there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Probably. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: For sure. &gt;&gt; JEN: Or, like, in a cup? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're so silly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, hey there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? You look cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, there's two ice cream things I want, but I feel like you should get them after. They always say never go to a grocery store hungry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I'm starving so that's a problem. Where's Kourtney? She's always late. See, Kourtney has everything that's green. Like, she made me replace every single last thing in my kitchen that's plastic. Kim, we're turning over a new leaf. &gt;&gt; KIM: A very green leaf. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! &gt;&gt; MASON: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Mase! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This has changed my life, this store. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It has? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, dude. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: We'll be back. We're gonna go get water. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I just tell you something really quick? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I'm supposed to go out to lunch with Scott, um... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I don't think he's... I think he's, like, M.I.A. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I didn't know he was M.I.A., and I just wanted to make sure that I had your blessing before I just go have lunch with him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but you don't need to go in public, where, like, people see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to be very transparent with Kourtney and let her know that I want to talk to Scott, because I want her blessing. I want her to know how I feel. And I think it's important for me to reach out to him because I want him to know that I'm here for him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I'm gonna call you later and let you know if he reached out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just tell me when I see you at the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But just so I'm clear before... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just wouldn't go somewhere in public, 'cause there's no need. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, but I have your blessing to have a chat with him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sure, he can come over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I'll have him come to my house, then. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I'm going to take him maybe to a quick pet store, and then I'll see you at my house. &gt;&gt; MASON: Pet store! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Love you. &gt;&gt; MASON: P-P-Pet store! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here, sister. Do I get a hug hello first? Mmm... So do you want two of these, or you want a Oreo? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: One of those. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I have one? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not organic. That's not with organic eggs. &gt;&gt; KIM and KHLOE: That's not with organic sprinkles. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mmm. This house has nothing organic in it for me to eat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, there is organic things. Go eat the fruit. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are so tiny. I am... never been more jealous of a human in my life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your tits are... &gt;&gt; KIM: Are heavier than you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, but that's probably why you're bigger, 'cause your boobs are so big. I'm so jet-lagged from Australia. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are? Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I just came back from Australia. Look, I love going to these places, I love doing these things. I don't mind the work, but sometimes I feel like I really, like, pick up the slack a lot of times when people... I'm doing a kids' promotional tour, and I don't have kids. You guys all have families and kids. I have no friends anymore. I don't have time to, like, meet people or go on dates because I've done too many jobs or picked up the slack, so I've lost everybody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you gonna go put Mason to bed tonight? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. This wholeis so weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But part of love is being honest, and you really up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys all have families and kids. I have nothing anymore, because I've done too many jobs. I don't have time to meet people or go on dates, or if I do, it has to dwindle out because then I'm working too much and it's just a non-consistent relationship. I just want when I want to have, like, my fun time, maybe to, like, if you guys could ease up on me just, like, a little. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So why don't you write down the things that are important to you, like, say... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But that's not taking a two-week vacation. Like, you guys have your lives. That's what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll pick up the slack. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I'll fill in October, so you don't have to. I understand Khloe's point. Clearly, Kim and I have been busier lately, having children. And I do feel bad, and I want Khloe to have a personal life. I want her to be happy. I don't want her to be stressed out or overwhelmed. And I'm happy to try and step in a little bit more. I think that your issue is... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But sometimes I... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm gonna tell you what your issue is, 'cause I actually do know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, what is it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You feel guilty saying no to anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. Very true. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, so you've been overworked and you've been doing all this stuff. Like, just say, "You know what, I really need the day off tomorrow." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one would understand that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, they would. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have a baby. It's, like, such a good excuse. Like, you don't have to do anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who am I gonna have a baby with? Batman? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wouldn't that be amazing? I love Batman. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who? What Batman? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Any of them. They're all good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Some freak on Hollywood and Highland. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, he needs to be, like, legit with the Batmobile. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, get out of my house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mm? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can come on in. You know what, I have something really cute you can take over to the kids that they might like. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I found this at a store. It's a whole pad. You color this, and then you make it, like, a little mask. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And they can put it on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And is that, like, a bow? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We need to figure out what your daughter though is saying now. She's like, "Don't let him in the house. He didn't schedule the time." I'm like, "What? The time?" I go, "I went to work, I did what I had to do, and now I'm going to the house." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what's going on with you guys, but maybe you need to think, "I'm gonna try and be proactive in making this a better..." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right, but every day it's a different story. When we got separated, the whole thing was, "You're not gonna have the kids stay with you, but I'm gonna have an open-door policy here, that at any time, any hour, you want to be here, you can be here with the kids." Then it went to, "You need to schedule times." Then it went to taking the bar codes off of all my cars so I couldn't get into the house without dialing the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like I'm missing a piece of the story. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So am I. Every single day, I was driving there, sitting with them all day, every day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to just see if we can get her on the phone? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sitting here with Scott. You're on speaker. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just trying to be the mediator here and not cause a problem, and you're my priority. I'm just wondering, from your perspective, because Scott seems a little confused, because he thought there was an open-door policy, that he could come by whenever... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There was. There was. But that has changed. He was flaking too often. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Every time I tried to have him sit and have dinner with them, he sits in the other room on his phone. He flaked on going to the kids' first day of school. He says, "I can't go 'cause I hate school I get anxious." When really, he went out and, like, partied through the next day. Just like a realass His main concern is himself, not the kids. And that's what's important here is the kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He flaked on going to the kids' first day of school and, like, partied through the next day. Just like a realass His main concern is himself, not the kids. And that's what's important here is the kids. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Didn't you tell me to stay at the house when you were gone? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I asked you if you wanted to; you said yes. You flaked on Sunday. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right, so I'm there today and I'm going there, and then you're telling the gate I can't come in? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You didn't make a plan. You know you need to tell in advance. The kids had plans. It's like, I've got to get off this hamster wheel, 'cause this is not what my life is going to be. So none of these things are happening anymore. They need consistency, they need a parent who is going to be present and provide them with a beneficial experience, not something that's harmful. I can't wait for the day that we can all hang out together, do things with the kids as a family, but he's not in that place right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, would it be okay if he went by and put Mason to bed tonight, and P? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sure, if he was there when they get home to have dinner at 5:30, sit and have dinner with them... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Anything else, boss? You want me to fold any of your clothes or anything? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want you to stop by for 30 minutes and then you get a call to go out, and then you're like, "Sorry, I got to go." The kids are like, "Why did Dad leave?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 'Cause we don't live together. It's better I see them than not see them at all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can you not commit to going for, like, two and a half hours? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Of course you can. Kourtney, we're gonna hang up now, but he'll be over there by 5:30. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love you, too. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you gonna go put Mason to bed tonight? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. This wholeis so weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But do you want to? That-that shouldn't be... That... this doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I'm going to Florida. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're going to Florida? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: In a couple hours. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. If that was my window to spend with my kids, I'd go enjoy my window. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is just crazy. It's like, "All right, sit with your kid, eat dinner with your kid, put your kid to sleep, and then get out." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Listen, but it's part of the price that you're gonna have topay for this whole thing. You have to earn back trust that you've lost. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I know. It's just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just not as easy as it sounds. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not gonna be easy, but you have to fight... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've talked to her about it, she said... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't just talk about it, you have to show your actions. I have to be honest with you. Part of love is being honest, and you reallyup. &gt;&gt; KIM: On the next episode... &gt;&gt; CROWD: Surprise! &gt;&gt; RYAN: Welcome to your graduation ceremony. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know how, like, I'm kind of, like, psychic? The other day, something woke me up; it whispered in my ear. It was going, "Khlo..." I just want to know who my little friend is. It just jumped! &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You have elevated blood pressure. &gt;&gt; KIM: After Paris, my feet and my hands completely swelled up. I really hope it's not diabetes. I'm, like, actually scared.
