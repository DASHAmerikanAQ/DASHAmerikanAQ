- &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I get you something to drink? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: AquaHydrate. We need AquaHydrate water. Do we have any? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: On the floor in that white... I'll get it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got it. Would like some water and ice? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He doesn't drink ice. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No ice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Would you like it in a glass? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I never get this treatment at the house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom is seriously obsessed with Lamar. Come on, people. There's a time and a place. And there's like-- you're going a little too far. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I have a crazy question. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: For me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Do you get any extra tickets for playoff games? No, just because there's so many of us. I just wondered if they gave the families more tickets when it gets to, like, the crazy playoffs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, well, they don't go around to each player and say, "How many people are in your family?" Let me just make this clear. I have four tickets. I get one, and that means I have three to give away. My mom thinks all of a sudden, oh, the playoffs-- I should get more tickets. No, it doesn't work that way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want some dessert? How about a brownie? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I would love a brownie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: âŞ Let's go Lakers, let's go Let's go Lakers, let's go. 32 00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,411 And my girls are here. We've got 'em all. Khloe, Kourtney, Kim-- looking beaut... I think you look better than you've ever looked. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, thanks. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Really. Well, let's catch up a little bit. &gt;&gt; KIM: Today, me, Kourtney and Khloe are on the Ryan Seacrest show. And we have a lot to catch up on. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Let's just fast forward a year from now. What happens in your life, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In a year from now I'll be pregnant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What a difference a year makes. &gt;&gt; RYAN: You will be pregnant in a year? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll probably have a second baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; RYAN: Really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I just want Mason to have a sibling. Like, Kim and I were 18 months apart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, we have to sew up her vagina, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, you need a little friend. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Kim? You are the only single one now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Okay, are you dating anybody now? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm not. I just, you know... &gt;&gt; RYAN: There's really no one? Do you get asked out? You got to be... I mean, come on, people have to ask you out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She definitely gets... &gt;&gt; RYAN: Tell me, who's asking her out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Literally, every guy asks her out. &gt;&gt; RYAN: NBA players? &gt;&gt; KIM: Way too tall for me. And just not my style. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's another thing-- she doesn't want too tall of guy. Like, Kim's list maybe is... &gt;&gt; RYAN: It's almost impossible? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's maybe two people in the entire world. &gt;&gt; RYAN: But she does that on purpose. She makes the list impossible. 68 00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,677 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; RYAN: On purpose. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone is nuts for these tickets. Like, you would have thought I was, like, dealing crack cocaine, and this was... they've had a hit and they need more to keep that high. Like I've never... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like you never invite me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never invite anyone. It's just honestly, like, first come, first serve. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you going to get a championship ring? &gt;&gt; KIM: I brought us all food. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it's Santa Claus. &gt;&gt; KIM: So now that I'm single, a lot of my time is freed up, and I'm just really excited to spend more quality time with my sisters and to hang out tonight. So I have the best night planned for us. After dinner, we're going to Clueless. We're going to have, like, old-school fun times. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have a date tonight with Lamar. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's actually, um, was going to come by to hang out with Mase and I. But if you want to have date night with Mason you can. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to have date night with me? Oh, you're grabbing for me. You do, you do, you... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I totally think that Kim should get out there and start dating, because sitting home on a Friday night with Mason, I don't think there's much of a future there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, I'm going to go feed him and then bring him back for your big date. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, you guys are really going to leave me alone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, you can't be so needy. You really got to start dating. You're like the old woman who lived in a shoe who had nothing to do. &gt;&gt; KIM: I do miss things about being in a relationship. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like I love, like, you know, just, like, having someone that I call every second to tell them things. And knowing that there's just always someone there-- like, you want to go eat together, do you want to get a movie... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, see, but without dating, you can't have those things back. It's like ripping off the Band-Aid. Well, I am going to go on my date night with Lam-Lam. Love ya. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have a date night with Mason, I guess. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have fun with Mase. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I've been doing my homework and I want to talk to you about something. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think your eyes are a little too smoky for every day? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I'm going through a phase. Is that okay with you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I'm also going through a phase of trying to find you a boyfriend. How about Gerard Butler? &gt;&gt; KIM: How about barf? My mom has made it her mission to find me a boyfriend, which is so pathetic. Like, I don't need help. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Luke Wilson's pretty cute. No? &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What about Alex Rodriguez, A-Rod? &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like everyone's boned him. Cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wouldn't be a good manager or a good mom if I didn't find out who's really single out there and who would be a great match for Kim. Ryan Phillippe? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't really want to date someone in the industry. Like, I'm over it. Like, I really don't. I want, like, a normal person. I don't know, maybe I should try and find a nice Armenian guy like my dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A nice Armenian boy. Okay, Kim, I'm all over it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Make sure that they're not too hairy, though. Laser hair removal is a necessity. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, another requirement. That's fabulous. 137 00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,931 &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a must for an Armenian. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, look how sexy you look. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe is getting her first laser hair removal. And why it's taken her so long is beyond me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, Kim. I don't know why you think it's okay just to call me and ask me for Laker tickets. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but it's just so exciting. I used to like dream of the days when someone would want to come to a Saints game, you know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I heard Mom is, um, hooking you up on some dis-ates. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's trying to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, with who? &gt;&gt; KIM: She just said she wants to try to set me up with someone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you're letting her? &gt;&gt; KIM: And she's going to call around. I'm looking for someone that has a six-pack, has a full head of hair-- they cannot be balding in the least. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She really only cares about looks. Kim's standards are ridiculous. Fabulous body, beautiful back and arms and... Kim is very into appearances. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, you have a better, like, looking vagina than I thought. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; KIM: I got a glimpse. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What did you think my vagina was going to look like? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. I've never looked at your vagina, but, you... I thought it was like a shaved rashy vagina. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have a nice ass too. 167 00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,012 &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to look at your ass &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Toilet seat's all busted. Look at that thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love Kim's perfume. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It sells so well. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw, I just, like, shoved it up my nose. Bruce is our unofficial maintenance man. Normally when we ask Bruce to fix a lightbulb or whatever, he's like, "Okay, I'll come after golf." Seriously, I could not even hang up the phone before I saw him walking in the door. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's get down to the important stuff, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Laker tickets, baby. Kendall and Kylie, they want to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They want to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall and Kylie want to go? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. But if one of them can't go, maybe I'll just go alone. What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So it's you want to go with the girls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not me. But they would like to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fixing the toilet. What else do I do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I knew Bruce would be over here trying to weasel his way into getting Laker tickets. I don't like competition. Bruce, go back to the decathlon. I can handle this one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whose birthday is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's nobody's birthday. I was just shopping, and I got you something that I thought you'd really like: Lanvin. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't it gorgeous? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is stunning! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. It's their new bag for summer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I love this bag! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I knew you would. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is this for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just 'cause I thought it looked like you. You deserve it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're doing it for Laker tickets, aren't you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't have to do anything. If you love me enough to give me a Laker ticket, then you love me enough to give me a Laker ticket. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: True. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Otherwise, enjoy your bag. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: By the way, you need this dusted, Khloe. Look at this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, maybe you can do that right before the game. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Anything else you need... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are really 214 00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,215 shady people. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; GEORGE: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm looking for George and Jack. &gt;&gt; JACK: That's us. &gt;&gt; GEORGE: I'm George. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're George? &gt;&gt; GEORGE: Pleasure. Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And you're Jack? &gt;&gt; JACK: Yeah. Very nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my son and my daughter talk about you guys all the time. &gt;&gt; JACK: They're like family to us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I need a new sound system in this thing. George and Jack-- they're both Armenian-- so maybe they'll have a good lead on somebody Kim could date. Here's the thing, I was wondering if you guys knew any really great guys for Kim. &gt;&gt; JACK: That's tough to match somebody up with Kim. That's a tough one. She's uh... &gt;&gt; GEORGE: Perfect. of Armenians here in Glendale, so while I'm in the neighborhood, what can it hurt to check out a few places here? It might be a long shot, but what have I got to lose? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I see one! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, stop it. How cute is this? Look, Armenian, Arabic, Persian and Russian. Do a lot of single guys come in here to get their baklava...? &gt;&gt; MAN: A lot of single guys, a lot of single girls, a lot of married people. Everyone loves baklava. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have any friends that are single? &gt;&gt; MAN: Of course I do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm trying to set my daughter up with a really cute Armenian boy. &gt;&gt; MAN: Of course. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you know of any really cute, young Armenian men that are single? Do you understand English? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: A little. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A little. This is gonna be a really big challenge, but it's okay. I'm up for it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom's looking for an Armenian man for my sister. &gt;&gt; MAN: You can call. I'll give you my business card now. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Can I give you a hug? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sure! Oh! Thank you. Are you Armenian? 254 00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:11,010 &gt;&gt; WOMAN: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. I'm looking for a nice Armenian boy for my daughter. &gt;&gt; MAN: I'm a priest. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, right. Hey, Mason, this is the land of your people. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is not the land. This is Glendale. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think we're striking out here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Two blind dates. My mom is trying to set me up on a blind date. Is it the law? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've already talked to the guy on the phone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you can untalk to him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who'd you invite to the game? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob and Malika! &gt;&gt; KRIS: So there's one ticket left. So, can I have that ticket? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob's inviting someone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He shouldn't be able to invite a date. That's not cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, honestly, your sex scene over here, you got to calm down. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I mean, like, you're just, like, modeling for us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You'd think Rob is in, like, a porn video or something. Oh, my God, this is Kylie calling me, and she's in school. I guarantee you she's calling me about Laker tickets. I can't wait for them to win that ring 'cause I'm just over giving everyone tickets. It's just more of a hassle to have these tickets than it is to not have the tickets. But Rob is the best. Rob literally, like, never asks for tickets. He, like, not annoying about it. He's, like, "Oh, if you have an extra ticket, I'll go." &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe, I wanted to bring someone to the game. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, like who? Jesse or JJ? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I want to bring, like, a girl. &gt; MALIKA: What girl? &gt;&gt; ROB: A friend that I've been dating. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob... &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: of course, you and her could come. Malika and I on a date, you and your imaginary friend on a date. This is perfect for me because then I don't have to decide: Rob, perfect, you have a plus-one, go. We're done. gay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, make her kiss her muscles. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe... : Khloe, stop! No! &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, come in here and bond with me now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Pretend like you like me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, I want a bite of the apple. My car's in the shop again. I have to go have Shiva pick it up tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, I went to go see the Platinum guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: George at Platinum? He's doing my iPod thing over again in the G-wagon. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And he actually says he has some really cool guy to set you up with, like, on a blind date. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't do blind dates. My mom is absolutely crazy. She's trying to set me up on a blind date with someone that never even seen. Who is this guy? Like, details: What does he look like? What does he do? How old is he? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's Armenian. 314 00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,663 &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is he a hairy beast? &gt;&gt; KIM: Should I show up like that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think Kim really realizes how much work and energy goes into finding her the perfect date. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to go on a blind date. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You like your routine. Well, you're gonna go. I'm gonna make you go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, you're gonna make me. Is it the law? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I've already talked to the guy on the phone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you can untalk to him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here it is; Alecko's number. There you go. You call him. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am not, I am not calling him. Sorry, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you have to call him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I'll e-mail 330 00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,794 you this number. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know that the way into Lamar's heart is through his tummy. So I thought I'd take it upon myself to go over and make sure that their refrigerator was stocked with all the things that they love. Khloe, have a brownie. I just made 'em. They're fresh, fresh, fresh. Your favorite. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm, is it mine or Lamar's favorite? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it's your favorite, and now Lamar's. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I have this recipe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, of course you can. Should I type it up for you and have it delivered? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom is nuts. This is how she plays tricks on all of us. Honestly, we got to relax with, like, the dramatics in this family. So why don't you just come out, ask me the question? I want to hear it straight from the horse's mouth. Come on, Mr. Ed, tell me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I don't think there's any harm in trying to butter you up a little bit in case I just happen to want to go to the Laker game this week. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The ticket's already spoken for. You made this a little too late. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? Who'd do invite to the game? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob and Malika! &gt;&gt; KRIS: So there's one ticket left. So, can I have that ticket? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob asked me. He wants to bring a date. I said, "Fine, bring a date." &gt;&gt; KRIS: A date?! He shouldn't be able to invite a date. That's not cool. &gt;&gt; ROB: Um, I highly disagree with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You see what happens first. &gt;&gt; ROB: I never go to any games 'cause you guys always want to go. Everyone always asks Khloe, and she takes all you guys. I don't understand why you need to go. You don't know anything about basketball. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been going to basketball games, Robert, since before you were born, so sorry. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. I actually enjoy the game. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And they were Laker games, okay, with Auntie Shelly. You know what? I'm outta here. You go to the game with your little date, and you go have fun. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom, I'm not gonna go if you're gonna make... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm taking... No! I'm taking my brownies. When Lamar comes home, a snack. He'll appreciate me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who out of you six and a half think they're going to the game tonight? News flash, everyone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you haven't even called this guy, that's kinda rude. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not going on this date. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: Hello? 381 383 00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,919 &gt;&gt; Want some baklava? &gt;&gt; KIM: Actually, I do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom said that George from Platinum told her about this guy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So have you talked to him yet? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I don't want to be set up on a blind date. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's weird. I mean, I don't know anything about this guy. I just know his name's like Alecko. What does he do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He plays for the L.A. Galaxy. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's a sports guy and Armenian? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. I'm usually not one to go along with my mom's crazy schemes, but I actually don't think it's such a terrible idea for Kim to go out with this guy and just see what he's like. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to talk to him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Call him right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you call and pretend you're me, please? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. I'm Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Is this Alecko? &gt;&gt; ALECKO: This is Alecko. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. It's Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: Hi, Kim. How you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm good. Just eating some baklava with my sister. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: That's awesome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where are you from? &gt;&gt; ALECKO: I'm born and raised in Jersey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you know anyone from like Snooki? &gt;&gt; ALECKO: No, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So what kind of name is Alecko? Is it Armenian? &gt;&gt; ALECKO: It's actually a Greek name. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, that's cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: And this is like, so, just embarrassing, that my mom is, like, out trying to, like, set me up on a date. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: I think that-- I think that's great. That shows that she loves you. She cares about you, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: I wanted to see if you were free tomorrow night. I was thinking maybe we could go grab some dinner. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, it is really awkward, like, my mom trying to set me up on a date. We don't really have to go. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: Oh, no problem. I was actually thinking about a place called Carousel. It's an Armenian restaurant in Glendale. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's my favorite restaurant. That's where we used to go with my dad, like, all the time. Every birthday... It's one of our favorite places. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: I've been there a few times, so figured it'd be the perfect place to go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, for sure. Let's do it. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: Okay, sounds good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was meant to be. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I mean, he was really nice. I'm excited. Why not? Like, what else am I doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Duel workout. Duel workout. Duel workout. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: When are you getting me my tickets? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't press your luck, Kylie. Today is the day of the game. I invited everyone over, so we could establish who's going to get these Laker tickets. I made my choice, and hopefully they like my decision. Who out of you six and a half think they're going to the game tonight? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm all dressed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: News flash, everyone. None of us are going to the game today. Not one of us. We're going to go upstairs in our beautiful purple and gold theater room and we are going to enjoy the Laker game. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mason's not happy. Khloe is crazy. She knows how we all wanted to go to the game, and we've all been begging for tickets. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Laker ticket. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay... &gt;&gt; ROB: You've never had a good arm. Yo, Khloe's not much of an athlete. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is what I mean. Fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Give it to me, give it to me, give it... &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is my point. You guys are acting like dogs over meat. This is something that's, like, a luxury that we're all supposed to enjoy. This is supposed to be fun. And something family-oriented that brings us closer together, not further apart. So if you guys really want to go that badly, then go on your own. Or whoever wants these tickets. I'm off it. This could be your last time you ever go to the game then. So... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I vote for family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And we'll miss all that traffic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Exactly. No traffic. That was one of the cheesiest speeches I've ever made.

So how do you balance out, like, everything? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't really have a life. That's why I don't really like, you know, dating.

Do they have arranged marriages in Armenia? &gt;&gt; ALECKO: I mean, back in the day I'm sure they did. Not anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you been? You've never been to Armenia? Oh, my God. Neither have I. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: I know. We got to teach you some Armenian. You don't know any words? You've got to know some words. &gt;&gt; KIM: A few. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: What do you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, (speaking Armenian) and (speaking Armenian). The basics. &gt;&gt; ALECKO: You say it right, though. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm actually having a lot more fun than I thought I would.

Kimmy, how was it? &gt;&gt; KIM: It definitely, like, made me see that, like, dating doesn't have to be so awkward, and I'm totally down to... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not so bad after all? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's not so bad after all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you didn't have fun? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I had fun.

It was something to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But there's not going to be a second date? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No double dating? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Seriously though, I wanted to thank you for, like pushing me to date. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I should be going out on dates. I shouldn't just be sitting at home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you forever. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, but... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get your ass off my chair. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's the right place and the right... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kim is open to dating. There we go. &gt;&gt; KIM: I may not have found a love connection with Alecko, but I had a great time. And I realize dating isn't that scary. I'm really looking forward to seeing what else and who else is out there. Why didn't you guys go to the game? Why are you watching it here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Family time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't want to hear it. Just have some popcorn... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and call it a night. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Go Lakers! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go! Whoo!
