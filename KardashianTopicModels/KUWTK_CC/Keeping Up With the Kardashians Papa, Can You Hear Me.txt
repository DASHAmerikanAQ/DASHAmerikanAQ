- ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Gotta ask you something. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Talk to me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: About this jacket. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like this one. Oh, I like that. Let me see. Are you wearing a nightgown, or is that... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm wearing a robe. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This isn't, like, a dr... an outfit. : 'Ello, guv'nor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, greased lightning. What are we wearing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: By the way, I feel like we need to start pranking your mother with something different. Like, new material. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 'Cause the Todd Kraines thing is starting... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it has to be Todd Kraines. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys don't have any stress, 'cause you're not the ones calling her. Khloe, Kourt and I have been having some fun prank calling Kris lately. Kind of just like a fun thing to do, to... you know, just bond. And I've been pretending to be this old family friend, and I gotta say, we have Kris completely fooled. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The fact that she thinks that it's a creepy voice and she doesn't know it's you, like, it's amazing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Months calling... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need to call right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Auntie Kris, it's me. It's Todd Kraines. Where are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Todd Kraines. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Auntie Kris, it's me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She hung up on you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She hung up. "Todd who?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Call again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Auntie Kris, why do you always hang up on me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This isn't Todd Kraines. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who would you think it is? It's me, Todd Kraines. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop calling this number. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's the only number I have for you. She hung up. ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mom, if you're over there, cut me a little slab of that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, 'cause... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We never talked about, um, the New York game the other day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I go to every game. Of course I go. I'm not gonna let the Hump stop me from going to a game. During the third quarter, they had a jump ball between Lamar and the Hump. You would've thought it was a championship game. They were, like, stomping their feet and screaming and just so stupid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Who was with you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Were you at that game? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Was I what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Were you at the game? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was at what game? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He went to the game before. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been to one game all year, and that was with you the other day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You could... yes, I was at the game I'm talking about. I have definitely noticed that Bruce's hearing has depreciated here and there. This will take all the wax buildup out of your ear. Can you hear me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My hearing is fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is kind of frustrating when you have to yell something. He doesn't even notice that we're yelling, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think he can hear. He just doesn't want to. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce wants to kill himself. "Oh, my God." 74 00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,700 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh... I can't believe how much stuff they have. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tons of stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, I'm sure a lot of people look at us and think that our lives are always these wild times, but no. After you settle down, you end up at antique shops. I like this, uh, prop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Honey... Don't. You better watch out. Oh, my God, is that a stuffed cat? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What?! That's Mercy. Holy, what is she doing here? Hey, Merce. You know, at first, I was really not interested to go to this antique shop, but it turns out we saw some ancestors. We ran into Mercy... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh! &gt;&gt; KIM: Her name is Mercy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's very nice to see her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cici would love those little bags. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want to take a pic, throw it her way? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Should I call her? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. Love the Chaunch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need to ask her, I want to get tested for her, um, bone marrow. Cici is my second cousin. She's my dad's first cousin. I've always been really close to her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, hi, Cici. &gt;&gt; CICI: Were you so grateful for what you have? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cici has cancer that she's had for more than 15 years now. &gt;&gt; CICI: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Chaunch. &gt;&gt; CICI: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, I'm just vintage shopping with Scott. Oh, this... I see a red coral necklace. I swear you would love it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It looks like you'd be putting a lobster on top of your body. It actually matches your shorts, put this on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know what I was going to tell you is how I want to get, um, tested for the bone marrow. Stop. Every time the topic of Cici's cancer comes up, Scott always makes a joke, or turns it into something completely not serious. &gt;&gt; CICI: You want to do it through the Armenian Bone Marrow Registry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whatever it... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is that? They give you a little hummus on the side when you go in? &gt;&gt; CICI: Isn't he funny? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is so annoying right now. &gt;&gt; CICI: Okay. So let me ask the lady... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that a piranha? &gt;&gt; CICI: ...what the best way to do it is for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, ask her. &gt;&gt; CICI: Yeah, please... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause I want to go do it. Cici needs a bone marrow transplant. Khloe and Rob were both tested. We are trying to help spread the word. &gt;&gt; CICI: They have to be on some file, 'cause they've exhausted every other key pop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I want to get tested to see if I'm a match. You're not annoying. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. When this is done, can we go shop somewhere luxurious? &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's take your cooking skills and put them to good use. You know, Joyce made me a steak and marinated it in ketchup. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Joyce Kraines? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's supposed to make it... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait. What restaurant is your mom at? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, let's send a drink. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. Let's get her on the phone. Do you want me to just call and say, "Hey, it's Todd Kraines! Can I talk to Kris Jenner?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's eating with my mom. Just say, "My aunt Kris Jenner is in there. Can I talk to her, please?" Just talk in a normal voice first, here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, this is so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just say... "Hi, my mother..." &gt;&gt; HOST: How can I help you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi, how you doing? Uh, my mother and her aunt are eating at the restaurant. Can I just speak to my aunt, Kris Jenner? They're at the same table. &gt;&gt; HOST: For Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Auntie Kris! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's me, Todd Kraines. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. What's going on? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's dinner? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's dinner for you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just eating placenta. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. All right, you have a good evening. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. Love you, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: My God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can you turn that down? You need to turn it down. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? It's not that loud. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause I'm on the phone and I can't hear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why don't you just shut the door? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I shouldn't have to suffer 'cause you can't hear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Turning it down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce has a hearing problem. And this is a problem that's been going on for quite some time, and rather than just accept that and realize that he's got a problem, he would rather live his life in a vacuum. Seriously, Bruce? I-I have to finish this call. Please turn it down, because you turn it down, and then you turn it back up, 'cause you can't hear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, honey. Have a wonderful day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's time to go to the doctor. 179 00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,887 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't hear you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's nothing uglier than shopping for old crappy antiques. I like looking at cars, watches, clothes. So I figure I'm gonna pick my friend Benny up and I'll go look at things that I know, you know? Like Rolexes. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: So, can we make a deal on this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You said once you sell the diamond AP... &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: I'll get more than... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right, you give me a couple thousand. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: I'll be nice to you. So that's a couple there. You owe me $7,500. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I gave you that big Rolly. I don't think I owe you anything more. Think about it. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We'll put it down. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 42 on the platinum day-date, $7,500, and then two grand on that; that's, like, $51,000, that's it. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: Close. You're pretty close. &gt;&gt; BENNY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And then I'll take out a loan. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: Then I give you 25 grand on the loan at least. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, hold on. Let me just answer. I think it's Kourtney. Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Bug. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where did you go? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I picked up Benny and I-I had to go look at some watches. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was gonna ask you, I'm trying to arrange a trip to go see Cici in Vegas. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doll... I don't know when we can go and do that nor can I think about, like, visiting her right now, and I know she doesn't feel good. I'm just trying to, like, take my mind off of things. That's why I went to go look at some watches. Cici has been going through a lot of health problems. I try to be there for her. It's just, I'm not that good around people that are in bad shape. It's just scary to think about what life could hand you. You don't know. I'll be home. We can talk about it then. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I'm sorry. I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, I'll see you when you get back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, all right, bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce? Bruce? Bruce! Can I just ask you a question? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fire away. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This television is so loud that you can hear it in, like, San Diego. I know it's a touchy subject, but you can't hear. You, like, for real... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, honey, honey. Okay, okay, okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...legitimately cannot hear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How many times have we gone over this over the last couple of years? I know I do not hear as well as I used to. I'm 63 years old; I raced cars. I've been around loud noises my entire life, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, and my dad had the same problem, so I know that. I know that I do not hear as good as I used to hear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not listening to what I'm saying. Somebody might be able to give you a little relief. You could have the joy of being able to hear again and listening... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can hear! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. It doesn't mean that you're an old person because... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not worried about being old, honey. I still hit the golf ball 300 yards. You know, I'm not... That's not a concern. And we're done talking about this, okay? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I keep getting these tweets about this bucket list this woman Josie has. One of the things on the list before she passes is to meet me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who wants to meet you on their bucket list? No offense. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But there's people that do want to meet me. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Sometimes, it seems like you don't hear when people are talking to you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can hear, just not as well as I used to. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You're in your 60s. That's a natural thing that happens to everybody. I don't want you to be stubborn about this. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Do you ever get any time just to be pregnant? &gt;&gt; KIM: I spent all weekend relaxing. &gt;&gt; LEAH: That's so important, you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really happy that Bruce is connecting with his kids, and I want to connect with them, too, so I asked Brandon and his wife, Leah, to hang out. I get such heartburn. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I hate that feeling. It's awful. &gt;&gt; KIM: I never had it until I got pregnant, and I get it almost every day. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It sucks, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; KIM: You can't do anything. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Dad and I are very much alike; where we won't even take Tylenol or take Advil or anything like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Because he says, "My body is telling me something, and I don't want to, like, take something to numb the pain and then push it too far, you know?" He wants to know what his body is telling him. &gt;&gt; KIM: So why doesn't Bruce admit that he can't hear? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I've definitely noticed in the past year, at least, that my dad doesn't hear as well as he used to. Well, the problem is that sometimes people take offense because... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah, he doesn't want to say he can't hear it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what, I think you should tell him, 'cause if you do, then he'll actually go, maybe. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I... I don't know if... Yeah, it might be time for me to say something to him. Poor guy, but he doesn't want to... you know? He doesn't want to admit it, man. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love this thing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This juices anything? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Most things. Anything you'd like me to juice? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wouldn't mind juicing these balls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your balls? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I keep getting these tweets about this bucket list this woman Josie has. One of the things on the list, before she passes, is to meet me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who wants to meet you on their bucket list? No offense. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's people that do want to meet me. Just 'cause you don't want to know me. It's kind of hard for me to believe that it's real or not. All I know is there's a woman who's saying she's very sick, and before she dies, she wants to meet me. I mean, makes some sense, but it's kind of out there. Remember when you would do things for me when we first met, like, ask me if I wanted water in the middle of the night? Those were good old days. I mean, it only lasted a few weeks, but it was nice. This woman whose bucket list I'm on, I bet you-- I don't know how old she is-- but I bet she'd get me water in the middle of the night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So go hang out with her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't appreciate me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, we're back on, then. Hit me with the chips. 311 00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,781 Bucket list or not, I like where your head's at. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Looks nice back here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it is nice. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's a lot of work got put into this backyard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Months and months of work, but we got it done. Except right here. That's, like, the perfect place for a putting green. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You can still do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, yeah, you could. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I mean, the space is here; at least there isn't... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want to keep peace in the family, too. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, there's something that I wanted to talk to you about, I wanted to... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh, am I in trouble? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No, you're not... No, no, no, you're not in trouble at all. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, good. Whew! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No, it's just something that I noticed, and I don't know if you've even really acknowledged. I notice that sometimes you... It seems like you don't hear when people are talking to you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, my hearing, obviously, is not good, especially when I get in a loud area, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I been around loud noises all the time. My dad had the same thing. I got the constant ringing in my ear, and I know it's not as good, especially my right ear, because I can tell on a cell phone, you know, that the right ear's not as good. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You're in your 60s. I don't want... That's a natural thing that happens to everybody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. Yeah, I mean, I obviously have to go get it checked. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Have you considered getting it checked out? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. Oh, yeah, no, I've considered it, but I just haven't done it. You know? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, you should. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But, boy, they certainly have told me enough times, this whole family. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I know, but it also seems like you don't really want to acknowledge it sometimes. Like, you just kind of... I mean, a lot of times, when people bring stuff up like that, you go, "Nah, nah, I'm fine." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. Well, you always do, yeah. I mean, I can hear, just not as well as I used to. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I don't want you to be stubborn about this. I don't want you to be like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, stubborn. I'm not stubborn. I've never been stubborn. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, this is some good hair. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe and I invited Scott along to go wig shopping for Cici. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This place is like the motherland of hair. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like that, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely don't want Scott to have regrets about avoiding people in his life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm kind of into this whore hair. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's that orange hair right there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at it blowing in the wind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How do I look? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Looks like somebody landed on your head. Oh, it's the Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, do you think it's sanitary to be doing this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're not having sex with them. Do they sell pubes here as well? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's take a picture. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't want this on the Internet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People already think I'm a man. Let's show them my dick next. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should we look for something for Cici? I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you gonna pick a wig for Cici for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause all of her hair fell out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This was, like, fun until you started talking about Cici needing a wig. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's too much for me. I'm gonna go sit in the car, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The second we bring up Cici, Scott runs away, which is just so typical. He needs to face some of these issues and not run away and hide from them forever. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Every time you hear the beeps, raise your right hand. Relax for a moment. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm exhausted. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Some creep keeps calling me, going, "Hi, this is Todd Kraines!" It's a little creepy. It's like, I almost called the... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's kind of hot that you have a stalker, though. ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no. I don't want... No. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's Khloe's. You... It's Khloe's. Chill out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's Khloe's dog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not, not even close. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not Khloe's. You're lying. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Bible, it's Khloe's. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, little fella. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't even think about it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's a nice dog. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This dog is so scared right now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's the dog's name? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a boxer, and his name is Bernard Hopkins. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that's Rob's friend. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause Lamar said he just won the world title, and he's 41 years old and he's one of the best boxers in the world. But we're calling him B-Hop for short. I have a new dog. Bernard Hopkins, A.K.A. B-Hop. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: B-Hop. B-Hop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar really wanted the dog, and I've always wanted a dog, so we got a dog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That dog pees in this house and you're dead, Khloe. Do you know how much pee I've picked up over the years? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you pick up pee? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And most of it isn't mine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Some creep keeps calling me going, "Hi, this is Todd Kraines." It's not funny. It's like... It was funny for a few minutes, but it's not funny when someone's sending you flowers. I mean, the flowers are beautiful. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Those are gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Somebody is obsessed enough... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's a little creepy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's kind of hot that you have a stalker, though. That's when you know you've made it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One of my best friends, Joyce Kraines, has a son named Todd, and for about the last six months, I've been getting the strangest phone calls from "Todd Kraines." And it's not Todd Kraines. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's like, "I'm kind of scared." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She says this guy calls me with a really creepy... creepy high-pitched voice. 432 00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,959 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you tell L.D.? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He was there. &gt;&gt; LAURA: Hi, there. My name is Laura. I'm going to be testing your hearing today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Laura, let's do it! I think Brandon made a very good point. You know, from my standpoint, I need to be responsible and really take care of this 'cause I don't want it to affect other people. &gt;&gt; LAURA: Every time you hear the beeps, raise your right hand, even if it's very faint. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got it. &gt;&gt; LAURA: Okay, I'm going to start now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is tough. &gt;&gt; LAURA: Now you're going to repeat the words, okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Repeat the words? &gt;&gt; LAURA: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fat. Lote? Choice. Dime... &gt;&gt; LAURA: Okay, you can relax for a moment. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm exhausted. &gt;&gt; LAURA: I will take you to the doctor. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; LAURA: Okay, have a seat. The doctor will be right with you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thanks. All righty. &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. I heard you were in surgery. &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: I was in surgery. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, that's a good excuse. &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: Tell me why you're here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I ask too many what's. &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: Family's complaining? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Family's always complaining, yes. I keep wondering i-is it selective hearing? &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: It's funny. As men get older, we lose high frequencies, and guess who has high-frequency voices. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are women. That's exactly right. Yes, very good. &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: Here's your hearing test. You're normal in the lows, but you have a substantial decline in the highs. Your word understanding cells are doing well, though. You got 100% of the words correct in the right setting in your left ear. You got 84% in your right ear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it was easier on the left ear for the words. &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: Yeah. So... two things that I would recommend. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: I think you would benefit from open fit hearing aids. They're a type of hearing aid that's very tiny behind the ear. And from a medical perspective, because you admittedly-- and it shows here-- had a little trouble understanding words out of your right ear than your left, have you ever had an MRI of your brain? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: Never? There can be a benign growth on the hearing nerve that can cause that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hmm. &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: So are you up for both of those things? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: Okay. Anything else? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nope, that's it. &gt;&gt; DR. FREEMAN: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Doctor was saying something is growing or a cyst or something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't say that I'm not a little worried that 492 00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,723 there's something a little more serious going on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Packing for Paris. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is how you pack? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just getting ready. This is just, like, the vibe. I'm going to Paris for Men's Fashion Week. I need to be prepared. So I got to get my cane. I'm thinking maybe one tuxedo, a couple three-piece suits, a couple two-piece suits, a casual suit. Wristwatches is gold for night, silver for day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So what's shaking, sugarplum? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What'd you ever decide about going to stop by that woman on the way? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. I don't know why people keep asking me these things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Sorry for asking. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. Can I talk to you for one second? I didn't mean to cut you off in there. You know I'm not good at talking about, you know, death. It's like... I'm not so sure I want to be around someone dying. You've had someone who's passed away and, you know, Cici now with all these problems, and I don't know how to... console somebody and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I think you need to deal with these things, though, and not run away from it. This would mean so much to her, even if you are awkward and uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I agree. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ever since I've known Scott, whenever an issue comes up over somebody being sick or the topic of death, he just ignores it. I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, especially with the people that you love. You know, just be there as much as you can. I think this is becoming a bigger problem for Scott 'cause his dad has been sick for years. I'd love to get him to realize his fears and then hopefully he could feel better once he admits it and knows that he is uncomfortable. I'm not trying to tell you to go or not go, but I'm just saying you need to make up your mind so everyone can plan. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna call and see if, like, I can even get flights. I'm not good at facing things that are this serious. I wish I was; I'm just not. But I never really thought that anybody would want to meet me that bad. I just wouldn't feel right turning down a sick woman's dying wish. No matter how hard it might be, I have to go, and I want to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're like the Grinch. Your heart grew. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Only a few. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Three sizes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But it was very small to begin with. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was two sizes too small. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And now it's three sizes too big for 'em all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's... : it's one size too 544 00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:23,862 big. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, look at you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you powdering up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wanted to look good for you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, right. You're really lying now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me... Hey, give me five for that. That was a good one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That was a good one, that was a good one, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I went to the, uh, ear doctor. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The ear doctor? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, the hearing doctor? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, that's what your ears do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And, well, what'd they say? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I took all these hearing tests. My low pitch was very good-- it was in the normal range. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's low pitch mean? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Down here, okay? : High pitch. Up here... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...okay, is where I have problems. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So does that mean I have to talk to like this all the time? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That would h... that would help. But, um, I got to get an MRI. My hearing is not as good in the right ear as it is in the left ear. Make sure you don't have a tumor or something like that on it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A tumor? You have a tumor? It never occurred to me that the reason that Bruce has lost his hearing wasn't because he's raced cars his whole life and flown the airplanes but it actually could be caused by a brain tumor. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He says it's rare that 575 00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:48,680 something like that would happen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm in Ohio, and I'm pretty nervous. I'm excited, but I do get anxious around people that I don't know, and I have no idea 580 00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:17,309 what's gonna happen behind this door. The lord is here. Hi. How you doing? Hi. How are you? How you doing? &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Welcome to Ohio. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: The lord! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you? Hi. Hi. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: This is my daughter, Allison. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; ALLISON: Good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So nice over here. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: So glad you made it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is, like, the Beverly Hills of Ohio, huh? &gt;&gt; JOSIE: It is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: When I walk into Josie's house, I definitely feel like an amazing energy coming off of her, and for a sick person, Josie sure doesn't seem sick. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: I can make you coffee or a drink? &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Mom, he doesn't want coffee; he's a lord. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't want to stunt my growth. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Can you believe it, Mom? Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: I want to cry. Did you see what I got over there for you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, a king's chair? I feel at home. Excuse me. If you don't mind, ma'am. You can just throw that anywhere. It's just mink. Oh, the lord is back, baby! This is beautiful. Thanks so much. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Have you ever been to the country before? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: No. Where? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My parents, like, we have a house in the Hamptons, in New York. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Very similar. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, the lord's on the wall. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Oh, this is famous in our house. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Yeah, this is where I hang all my fun stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And how long have you been sick? &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Um, I got sick in July 2010. Pain was terrible. I'd get it right here, and I would double over. It would hurt. Um, about a month after that, I found out I had lung cancer. So they had told me then that I would have, um, less than a year, and, um, he told me I was inoperable. The doctor suggested I try this aggressive chemotherapy and radiation, and, um, it worked. I got a scan. It was all clear. So, I'm like, "Good. It's gone. Great." Then in September of last year, they ran another scan, and now it's in five places. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't believe this woman has to deal with so much and has these two kids that are great and love her, and they have no idea if their mom could pass away at any time. I mean, that, to me, is, like, the most frightening thing in the world. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Now I'm kind of at, "What do I do?" Do I do aggressive chemo again? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For their sake. That's a hard decision. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: It is; it's tough because she's only ten, and, um, she's 18. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't do anything. I'm not a doctor. I can't cure her. I-I would have no idea how to make this woman feel better. I've never really been there for anybody, and I wish I could say I'd like to start. I just don't really know how. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: I'm thrilled to meet you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I'm happy that... &gt;&gt; JOSIE: But this whole thing is very bittersweet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is this supposed to tell us? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: He could have a tumor. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a little scary. I'm a little nervous about this. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: The doctor wants to make sure that isn't the case. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is the first time I've ever had the opportunity to actually... I mean, I don't know if you'd call it giving back. When I see Josie, I don't know. I just feel like I want to give 651 00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:46,551 her something. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I'm happy that... &gt;&gt; JOSIE: I can't believe you're in my kitchen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you want? Do you want her to keep fighting and keep trying? &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: I don't know. We have too much fun together for her to be, like, sick the rest of the time. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Well, and that's the other thing. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Like, me and my friends, we, like, make her go with us, do crazy stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's fun. You can never get those times back. My dad is, like, um, is pretty sick. Like, he's always, like, been in bad health. Like, he has diabetes, he's got, like, a million and one things wrong with him, and he went to the doctor recently, and, like, they told him, like, in order to live, like, another couple years, they were like, "You need to get a heart transplant." And he's like, he'll never be able to do that and live, like, he's in horrible shape. So now, my mom and him have just been, like, trying to kind of, like, live every day. Seeing Josie confront her illness really makes me think about my dad because, you know, my dad's been a diabetic and had problems since I was pretty young. I don't really talk about it all that much just because it's hard for me. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Well, it's funny because a lot of people say to me, "Why did you pick Scott Disick?" and I'm like... &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Yeah, they're like, "What's so special?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You could've got a real star over here. Yeah, like... Um, I don't even realize that, like, I would even be able to bring any kind of joy to anybody like this. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: He has a heart in there. We knew you did. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: When I saw the Oprah interview... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whatever. Trying to break the lord down. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I have a major, major fashion question. The other day, I did something a little different with it, and the lady at the coffee store goes, "Oh, I like your hair that way." So, this is what we're gonna do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna cut bangs? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Comb-over? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I don't think of it as a comb-over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? That's a... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hold it, hold it, hold it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're taking a fork to your hair? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I want to show you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who is he? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. It's horrible. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like it the other way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what, I had dinner with Auntie Joyce last night, and then Todd called me after. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? So you were... Wait, what flowers? Todd who? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kraines. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I got a phone call months ago. "Hi, Auntie Kris. It's Todd Kraines. How are you?" My intuition said this is not Todd Kraines. We're talking back six months ago. What is so funny? &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot believe Kourtney and Scott and Khloe have managed to trick my mom this long, because it's so ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I go... so, cut to Valentine's Day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is so weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And Valentine's Day, I'm with Bruce, and the waiter comes over, and he goes, "Mrs. Jenner, here's a glass of champagne. It's from Todd Kraines." And I... "Is he here?" &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna have a heart attack. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And the guy goes, "Yeah, he was here, but he just left." Yesterday, I got flowers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got flowers! $200 flowers from Mark's Garden. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And it said, "Dear Auntie Kris, why do you keep on hanging up on me?" Why are you laughing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Every time I hear them, I literally cry. My mom is so gullible. I just got a package here; you think it's from Todd Kraines? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. What's the purpose of some creep calling? "Hi, Auntie Kris. It's Todd Kraines." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Except "I'm a creep, and I need to talk to you." &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Oh, here comes my friends, my high school friends. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, look at the Jodie Foster of Ohio. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I loved her speech. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: There's Anne. This is my crazy friend. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: She gets nuts. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I bet. How are you? &gt;&gt; ANNE: Nice to meet you. Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Good. Meeting new people, to me, is a little bit scary to think about, but at the same time, it seemed like when I see all her friends come over, I mean, they're so optimistic and just so positive, like, on another level. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: We all need to do a shot for Josie's bucket list. &gt;&gt; ALL: Josie! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Jose, this is for you, baby-- I love you, cousin. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Does anybody have a camera phone? Josie's got such an amazing energy. The way she talks and the way she laughs, I mean, she really lightens and brightens up a room. To have gone through all these tragic things already and still keep her chin up every day, I mean... I never seen anything like this. Who knew that people still 754 00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:48,587 enjoyed life like this? I'm just so grateful to see somebody so positive in such a negative time. But now, when I see all of her friends come over, I mean... Her friends are nuts. But they all love her. To see all that love really... it's pretty special. &gt;&gt; ANNE: We are so thankful that you have all of us here to be a part of your bucket list. &gt;&gt; FRIEND 1: Yes. &gt;&gt; FRIEND 2: Yes, thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, it was just me, but... &gt;&gt; ANNE: It's not about Scott, it's about you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; FRIEND 3: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's right. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Don't you think she's cool? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. She's amazing. It's cool that you guys are, like, able to hang out and enjoy every day together, 'cause it's like, life is short, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: She always says, like, "Don't let cancer stop you from living." Sometimes I feel like someone's gonna call our house and be like, "Oh, this is all a mistake, like, this was someone else's, like, scans and stuff." You wouldn't even know that she had cancer, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Never! &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: She just like... goes out there and just lives it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I came into this situation thinking it was going to be extremely sad and I was going to walk out of this house down and out and feeling sorry for this lady. But it's really the opposite. So... it made me happy to come here, you know what I mean? Like... I know you just made a comment on my Rolex. This is out of, like, my own stuff, but I want you to have this Rolex. So you have your first... &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Sweet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: On my life, like... I didn't bring this... &gt;&gt; JOSIE: I know you love watches. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, like, here. It's a Mariner Rolex. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Aw... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The lord's watch. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes. You said something about this watch, and you never had a Rolex, so enjoy. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not big on giving, in general. But when I see Josie... I know it's kind of superficial, and it's kind of ridiculous, but... I don't know, I just feel like I want to give her something. I'm more thankful to have met her than she is to have met me. This is the first time I've ever had the opportunity to actually... I mean, I don't know if you'd call it "giving back." But I'm not a sentimental guy, so don'tdamage it, but... &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Here, give me a hug. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: Scott, thank you so much. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. I hope you enjoy it. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: I'm gonna get this bitch fitted tomorrow. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get that bitch fitted! Yeah! All I was thinking is that I was gonna hopefully make an impact on this woman's life, and really, she made more of an impact on my life. Just because somebody's sick doesn't change who they are. This is a very, very well-made cake. I don't know if I just cut that properly. &gt;&gt; JOSIE: You kind of cut it like a pie, but that's okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've never actually done hard labor. &gt;&gt; ANNE: Tell him your bucket list, baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What?! No, I'm not gonna have sex with you! I'm like... what? This woman's crazy! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. I didn't know you were coming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, why wouldn't I come? You were gonna come get an MRI all by yourself? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well... well, honey, you didn't have to. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When you have something... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's just a picture of my brain. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to see what's going on in there, 'cause I still don't understand it. Today is Bruce's MRI, and he might find out that he has a brain tumor. Worst case scenario. I just want him to know that no matter what, I'm gonna be here to support him. &gt;&gt; TECH: Everything all right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it's good. &gt;&gt; TECH: Perfect! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just so happy that Bruce has taken a really proactive step in trying to get help for his hearing problem. But I can't sit here and say that I'm not a little worried that there's something a little more serious going on inside that head of Bruce's. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: I heard you had a good nap there, huh? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's the whole key to that thing. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So your pictures, they're not all fully out, etcetera, etcetera. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then what is this supposed to, like, really tell us? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The doctor was saying if there's something... is growing, or a cyst or something, you know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So you know that you could have an infection, a tumor... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: That pushes on the nerve... so... wants to make sure that that isn't the case. So I'll sit down and examine them, talk to Dr. Freeman. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Anybody takes an MRI, and takes a picture of your head and everything that's going on in it, it's a little scary. I'm a little nervous about this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Bugs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So I just got in the car from Josie's house and I'm on my way to the airport. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How was it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was literally like... not trying to sound cliché, but it was... like, it was literally life-changing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She had such an amazing outlook on life, even though, you know, she's been suffering for years. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, you never really realize how lucky you are to be healthy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, it's so true. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And you know, it just totally made me think... even the whole thing with Cici being sick again, just... I even want to say sorry to you that I wasn't there for you more. You know, I love Cici so much, and... I don't want to think that there's a chance something could happen to Cici. Josie really makes me understand that you gotta just face things, no matter how hard they are, and you can't just not think about the bad. You may regret that, and you really can't take back time. And I was gonna tell you, like... I changed my flight coming home to meet you in Vegas so we could spend some time with Cici together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, that's nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So tell Cici I'm gonna come. All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I... All right; love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you. 884 00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,423 Bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: Matching couple. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We are! &gt;&gt; KIM: Matching couples. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at you, wait... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, even Khloe with a little-- baby! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? I don't have a baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Baby? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I said "baby." That's you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now I'm getting nervous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you nerve? What did they find? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm thinking, why did everybody show up to my ear thing? Did they, like, find a brain tumor or something, and I'm gonna die in two days? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We don't know. My mom filled Kim and I in, and so Kim and I wanted to be here at the doctor's office. Bruce is definitely trying to act all cool, but I know he loves that we're all supporting him. &gt;&gt; FREEMAN: How are you guys? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; FREEMAN: Okay, so MRI... Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS &gt;&gt; FREEMAN: Okay, so MRI... Your MRI's clear. No major tumors. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce is gonna live. &gt;&gt; FREEMAN: Brain's good. But I wanted to talk about what we talked about that will help you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. With the hearing? &gt;&gt; FREEMAN: Hearing aids. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; FREEMAN: And you cancelled. Why did he cancel his appointment? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He cancelled? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't cancel anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You cancelled? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't cancel anything. Gotta be honest with you, who wants to wear a hearing aid? I don't think anybody would want that. But I just don't want it, you know, to be seen, you know. Like you're actually wearing a hearing aid. &gt;&gt; KIM: We think he likes this not hearing thing, so he tunes us out on purpose. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Those high-pitched shrills. &gt;&gt; FREEMAN: You know, what I think would be better for you are what are called "open fit." They're, um, they're tiny, behind the ear, and your hair... you'd never see it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If I don't want to listen, I could just turn it off really quick. &gt;&gt; FREEMAN: That's right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Uh, yeah, I think we should look into that. I would like to hear better, that's for sure. And if if a hearing aid is the way to do it, then go for it. If it's, you know, not too offensive. All right, so how do we work the hearing aid thing? &gt;&gt; FREEMAN: We set it up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so let's set it up. 938 00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:07,285 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? : Yeah. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott went to qualify for this car racing thing. And he freaked out and left. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get him to grow up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Everybody's always looking at me to fail. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just feel like I need a break from Kendall. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to find your own identity. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am getting blamed for all your things... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall, you stress me out. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ...and I'm done with it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you two hug it out? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Robert has to turn himself in. &gt;&gt; ROB: The police filed a warrant for my arrest. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God.
