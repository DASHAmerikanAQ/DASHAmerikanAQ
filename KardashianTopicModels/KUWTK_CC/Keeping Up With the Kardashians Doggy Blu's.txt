- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I stepped in a huge pile of Kendall'sdog's dog! &gt;&gt; KIM: My God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every day it's the same thing! &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, shh, the baby is sleeping. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is making me gag. You don't smell this? I'm throwing up in my mouth. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well... &gt;&gt; KRIS: The dog is the size of a p... small pony. Could you get a wet paper towel, please? And stop pretending, in the mornings, like you don't need to clean up this It's day after day after day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, it's Kendall's dog. She needs to take care of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's not here. Kendall is such a dog lover and this year, Rob has decided to get her a puppy for her birthday. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How's the new dog working out? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good. Blu, come here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And not so lucky for me, Kendall's modeling is really taking off, so she's constantly traveling for work and I'm stuck here, picking up the &gt;&gt; KIM: Here. To go clean up the dog poop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You go... you can help me clean up the dog poop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do it every day, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am tired of cleaning up &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, I'm gonna be late. I have to go to a photo shoot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, I have to go, too. This is just a bunch of crap. I put up with. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was really just trying to think about the outside. Like, do you think we should do the whole project? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's... well, it's been going on a long time, that construction. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so over it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I am, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But we have to finish the fire pit and we either need to put the wood deck around the fire pit, or do the whole shebang. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I... it just depends on how long we want to stay here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott and I have been looking for houses for a little while now. We also had some plans drawn up to change our backyard at our current house to make it more family-friendly if we don't find something. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Visually, it'll look good. I don't know, but I kind of, like... need to try to focus on some of these little things that I have going on, too, and... What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is this trash? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't even hear myself think. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look. Is this trash? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's a good chance. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So do you want to leave it here for ten more years? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on. Could you just leave me alone so I can get some things done? I'm trying to take care of business. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know exactly what I do, yet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you do? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I gotta get out of this house. I can't work from home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm helping you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Help me help you get out of this office. My little office room is detached from the house, so I thought that would give me all the privacy I needed... but it doesn't. There is always people running in and out and... it's not easy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You got a nice little... pimple right on the tip of your nose. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying to do things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you not come in here and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, right... here. I've actually never seen one like that on you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, come on, man. Oh, my... I don't like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's gonna hurt. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ow! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I got it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Anyway, stop bustin' chops over here. I need to do things. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Those two things somebody sent you in the mail are actually pretty cool. They're like these Spanx things. One's a top and one's a bottom, like a legging. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There's, like, butt holes, Mom? Yeah, this would be great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I haven't seen 'em, honey. It would probably teach you, actually, responsibility if you got up every morning and took these dogs out and made sure they were okay and cleaned up their poop. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Teach me responsibility? Mom, please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you don't bring a big dog home and then just leave it to everyone else to take care of. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's not what I'm doing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's all I'm saying. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And don't act like you do anything to help her. She's not... you don't ever take care of her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, who gets up every morning and walks through the poop and lets the dogs out and then cleans it up? Who do you think does that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The lies coming out of your mouth right now... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know damn well you were not the one feeding these dogs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When was the last time you fed them? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Never. Never. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ...before I left for... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know who Kendall thinks is gonna take care of this puppy while she's gone, because she doesn't even ask about the puppy. I really feel like Kendall thinks that me taking care of the puppy is part of my job as a mom. But it's really my kids' responsibility if they want to get these animals. You fed them for 24 hours after you had the dog, Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's not true. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then you just expected them to magically get fed and groomed and taken care of. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's not true. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Not true at all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How come it always turns into me being this horrible person? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause you are a horrible person. To these dogs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, why are you making this so difficult? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Eat that pillow, eat it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no, no! No. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Eat it. Eat the pillow! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Don't eat... no. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Enjoy your life. Enjoy your life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't eat... ouch. Don't eat the pillow! Please, don't eat the pillow! No! No! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BEN: Welcome, hey. I'm Ben. Welcome to SoulCycle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's up? &gt;&gt; BEN: Uh, the first thing you want to remember is everything is with the beat of the music. One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, yeah. It's a little bit bizarre at first, but... yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does your vagina hurt when you do this? &gt;&gt; BEN: What's that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My vagina hurts. &gt;&gt; BEN: Oh, yeah, my... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is it supposed to? &gt;&gt; BEN: Uh... I've heard, yeah. You have to deal with that hurt vagina for, like, the first two or three classes, I think. We're gonna put our elbows in and press like this. Down. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa. &gt;&gt; BEN: Right and left. Nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does your crotch hurt? Like, mine hasn't seen this much action since 1934. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you always have to be the center of attention? It's so annoying. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, Mom, you're so embarrassing. You need to act your age. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BEN: Well, thank you, girls, so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, amazing job. &gt;&gt; WOMEN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You were amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; BEN: Lovely time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Amazing. &gt;&gt; BEN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This reminds me of being in the club. For real. This... I love the music, I love the energy. Everyone's so excited. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why are you going to clubs? This is so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like being out and about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ever since Bruce moved out, my mom needs so much more attention. But sometimes it's like, okay, relax, chill. Like, everyone knows you're here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's an embarrassment to the family. We should disown her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She really is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can hear you. I'm right here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kimberly's filming you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna post this, of you guys twerking. Twerk it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not the best twerker. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I told you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honey... &gt;&gt; KIM: My twerking skills are for the bedroom not for the club. ♫ ♫ KIM: Hi. What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sorry I had to call you back. I was putting the baby to bed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're supposed to be here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, there's like, literally, diarrhea all in the room. Like, it is so gross. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: From the baby? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, no, no. Not the baby. It's the dog. Ew, this disgusting dog. I just had to literally go put on some sandals. Oh, my God, if you even saw this, it... I... like, oh, my... I'm literally gonna barf, hold on. It is so disgusting. I don't know how it is, like, even possible for a dog to even like this. There is not any amount of money that anyone can pay me to clean this up. You have never in your life experienced diarrhea like this from that huge Great Dane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I... I don't care to. I believe you, I just don't want to see it. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Oh, my God, I literally feel light-headed. If you'd even seen what this looks like, you would die. You would just literally die. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I'm happy I'm not there 'cause I don't want to die. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, what's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Nothing. Do you smell this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. It's like, I smell anything. What is that other smell? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's like... this shirt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It smells like dog? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But it really reeks in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Will you, uh, put this in the dryer for me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: In the dryer? No, honey, you have to have this dry cleaned. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but maybe you could just put it in the pile over there. The dry cleaning thing in the laundry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are getting really lazy, honey. I mean, you can put it in your own self. Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You piece of &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I love this house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, who doesn't? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to move here though. I think this is so cool... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We can put, like, a bunk bed, and then a cool chair in the corner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How many more kids are we having? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would think two more. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Two more?! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mark, find me an apartment. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why does it smell like bleach down here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I'm trying to get rid of your dog's poop smell-- it's overwhelming. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, yeah, maybe you shouldn't let her in so early. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe you should take care of your own dog. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You piece of You're an awful person that you would let me walk into this as a joke! Are you kidding? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm an awful person? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you're an awful person. You can take care of your own stupid top. Oh, my God! It, like,.. And you don't even open the doors? You are not a good person. Where's Kendall? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have no idea. She's gone! Like, it's her, it's her responsibility! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am gonna vomit! This dog is the size of a horse and so is its! &gt;&gt; KIM: Here, I'll help. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you'll help. You're a pain in the ass, Kim. You don't even know how to help. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? That's how you're helping? I am going to throw up. It is so gross, and I'm, like, gagging. pooped and peed in my laundry room times two. I really think that my kids think that this is my job to take care of it all, and I'm over it. It's not fair! Ooh. I can't look at this! Kim, please, help me! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! I can't with that smell. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you're a piece of ! Get out here and help me! &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, it's not my mess! I didn'tall over the floor, and next time, teach Kendall to take her dog to, like, a dog spa or a kennel or wherever they house dogs for the weekend. &gt;&gt; KRIS:dogs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, are you...? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'm in the back of the restaurant in my van. In the back of the parking lot. You'll see the big black Sprinter van. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got the mobile office now. Just meet me in the van. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You got a van? Is this a joke? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Take a seat. You know, working from home just isn't right. People are always bothering me. I can't focus on what I'm doing. So, I have this mobile office. I'm kind of testing it out right now. I got Wi-Fi, I got speaker phone. I guess they're calling it Bluetooth these days. I got everything you need. So, I'm sure I can find some use for it here and there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What goes on here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just a little bit of work. I mean, it's a mobile office. I had to get out of the home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why do you have cheese when you're lactose intolerant? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was for you 'cause I knew you were coming. I set out an hors d'oeuvre. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But what's the point? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: When I'm in this van, it's all going on up here. I can get stuff done, I got Internet connection, I got television. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You wanted me to meet you for lunch to come sit in a van? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And have lunch with me. What's wrong with that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're not on the same page. Scott was trying to convince me to get one of these Sprinter vans so long ago, and now he's trying to come up with the excuse that he needs one as a mobile office, but he doesn't need it for any reason. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mark? Hi, it's Kourtney. Hi. I'm actually, Scott has this mobile office that he rolls around in, and I'm sitting in it with him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mark would, he would love to see this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He said you would love to see it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He needs one of these. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need one, he said. I think we were gonna go pick up Khloe at her house, and we were gonna see if you were available to look at that house. Yeah. Okay. But let's go show Khloe. What's the point of having a mobile office again? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's a lot of distractions lately at the house. I felt like for a guy like me on the go, running around, doing a deal here, doing a deal there. It's just easier for me to have the mobile office. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you think you're gonna get more work done? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, I can see more people. I'm trying something new out. You always say I should venture outside of the box. There she is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you joking? Wait, this is so awesome, Kourt. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, you have, you have no idea what's inside. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can we have this forever? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hold on, doll, watch out. Let me get you guys in there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where do I go? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sit over there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, this is so spectacular. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, is this not the chill zone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, road view. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's the! You see it all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so, Khlo, the deal on this house. There's a lot of things I like about this house. There's really not much that I don't like. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really like the pictures and the vibe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We should drive this everywhere. I think it just puts you in a good mood. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just easy. It's like you're on a plane just chilling out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This just puts you in a good mood. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thought it's supposed to be a work thing, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what? You work hard, play hard! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Work hard, play hard! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what I'm down for. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love that Khloe has the same appreciation that I do for this mobile van. And hopefully her energy towards it rubs off on Kourtney, and she realizes this mobile van is here to stay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh,! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, Khloe, let's look around. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the main TV room. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She probably understands that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, I-I know how to look at a house. I love this house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, who doesn't? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to move here though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We could be in here love-making, watching the kids hang out at the pool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to know what you guys do, but just like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Trust me, we're not having sex. We just like to pretend. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...watching your kids. hanging out. I want to say bad things just so you will not want to get this house, 'cause then I'm writing an offer right when you leave. Look, this is... I think this is so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would put, like, a bunk bed, and then a cool chair in the corner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How many more kids are we having? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would think two more. &gt;&gt; MARK: That's great. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Two more?! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mark, find me an apartment. And she's got birth control by the way and she doesn't take it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, I'm supposed to start on Sunday. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She said that last Sunday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guys, I can't deal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come take a look at the backyard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously, this is so nice! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, look at this. It's, like, a little paradise. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you don't take it, I'll take it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I'll live with Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We needed more hands up. Yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Don't double dip. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't double dip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't double dip. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This wasn't double dipping! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Put it in a little dish. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, I seriously I can't handle you two-- you're literally the same person. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. You guys just double dip to your heart's content. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why does it smell like bleach down here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I'm trying to get rid of your dog's poop smell that lasts and lingers for days after it poops everywhere. I mean, it's-it's overwhelming. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, yeah, maybe you shouldn't let her in so early. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe you should take care of your own dog. How about that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's pretty gross. Honestly, honestly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, why do I have to get up every morning, and clean up gag-worthy everywhere? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is just ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall was out of town and I was picking up dog poop. Now Kendall's back in town and I'm still picking up dog poo. And if I ask her to pick up her own, all I get is a nasty attitude. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I would do it happily, but you really didn't give me the chance. You do it before me and then you attack me for it after. &gt;&gt; THE GAME: Hold up! I got something to say about the twerk. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's a lot going on at the house, there's always people here... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing that you can't be bothered? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't like being interrupted. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can't keep your, this truck parked in our driveway. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not a truck. It's a mobile office. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Call it what it is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Meeting adjourned. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it's true. All right, I'll see you soon. Okay, bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The lord. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you, Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How the hell are you, Haverstrand? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Aw, just working away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you working? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm working in the bus. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is like a house on wheels. I want to go with you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bring, like, some kind of paperwork or some kind of contract just so you can work a little, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll bring some line sheets so we can do the buying for DASH. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll pick you up shortly and then we'll cruise the mobile. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bye-bye. I got to tell you-- I do like my mobile office, but sometimes I need a little action. If you want to kill time and have fun, you get Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! This mobile office is so divine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And if she wants to work a little in the van, too, that's fine. I don't mind renting you a little space in the van. You know, I'll rent you a couple quarter feet on the left side of the van if you want to get working. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh,! I forgot to bring the line sheets so we could work. Let's work from my cell phone. I haven't eaten once today. Hoorah on LAFoodTrucks.com. We can eat on the go, Mama Joe. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's the best part about it. You pick up and run. I've been in my office for a while, and I just want to be one with the people and the food trucks really, so why not? And I'm not gonna go eat at a restaurant like a peasant. I can eat inside my office. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I cannot eat here. Oh, my God. Can I do the Cheesy Mac Melt? And an order of tater tots full. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me... What is this, a tomato soup shot? What does that mean? &gt;&gt; FOOD TRUCK GUY: It's just like a little shot of tomato soup, it comes in a... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I'll take a cup. I'll just have that. I-I don't, I don't eat cheese. &gt;&gt; FOOD TRUCK GUY: I'm gonna bring it right over to you guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you bring it to the van? &gt;&gt; FOOD TRUCK GUY: I sure will. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, so we'll wait, so let's sit in the van. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The last few years have been not great, so I really cherish being silly and laughing and doing dumb things. And if there's anyone that I could guarantee do dumb things with, it's Scott. This is orgasmic. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The tots? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's, like, life altering. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my lord. What are they trying to do to people? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do people eat that for lunch? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Then go back to work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's the Go Green truck? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think it's only a few blocks away, and we'll actually have lunch there. 'Cause this is too much to handle. All right, let's get our health on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can I do the Kale Yeah bowl with chicken? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want the Kale Yeah bowl with... &gt;&gt; FOOD TRUCK GUY 2: The Mother Trucker patty? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, let's do the Mother... Just the names amaze me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What about the Kale Yeah? Kale Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hell Kale Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It just is icing on the cake that Khloe and I are into the same things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is the way to go. Who needs to go to a restaurant when you have a mobile office? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kale Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If I'm the pitcher, I don't need a bat. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I don't know why you have that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You did it! Home run! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, I should've done that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's Kim? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm having so much fun without her! Let's go find her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is happening? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're still here willingly? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I want to pull an all-nighter here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is a tough mirror. &gt;&gt; KIM: You think? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Or just a tough day. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom is being so annoying with Blu. She, like, won't stop complaining about... &gt;&gt; KIM: I would be annoyed, too. You're never home with the dog. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I just haven't been home for the past few weeks 'cause I've been busy, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: The past month, legit a month, and you left this, not even a dog, you left a horse. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're turning into Mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it is so outrageous what this dog does. It's not fair. It's not fair to do to anyone to let them clean up after your mess every single morning. The dog makes... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm sorry, I'm not home. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...the whole hallway a full diarrhea thing. It's, like, full of wet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! My mom and Kim are just two peas in a pod. They bitch and complain about everything, and they overexaggerate. And I also just don't think that muchcomes out of a dog. I just, I mean, their story was pretty elaborate. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, instead of being so mad at Mom, you should thank Mom for cleaning up after your dog every single day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, if you whore yourself out that much, and have six kids, you should have a little repercussions. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, that whore. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, isn't Kendall turning into a little mini Khloe. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's not a bad thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not at all. Probably the best thing for her, career-wise. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Could you do me a favor? Could you bring me an ice cold, uh, water down to me? I'm outside of the garage? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you come inside? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm in the office and I didn't want to, like, interrupt my work, so could you just bring it out in the mobile van? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is just getting out of control. I mean, I'm definitely not a waitress and I'm not gonna be Scott's little server. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is literally a joke at this point. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why? It's much more private than being home. No one distracts me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No one bothers you inside. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's not necessarily true-- there's a lot going on at the house. There's always people here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing that you can't be bothered? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't like being interrupted. I don't know why you're hating on my office. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. You can't keep your, this truck parked in our driveway. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not a truck. It's a mobile office. You're not going anywhere. I can always move. It's mobile. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's be honest. We know you're not doing any work out here. I see on the Internet you and Khloe eating at all the food trucks, and that's what you're doing with your time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's not all I do, but, yeah, there was one day Khloe came with me and we rode around for a bit. We took care of some things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're distracting yourself in this thing. Everything you're doing in here, you could do in your office at home. I know Scott is going through a lot and some of these purchases may make him feel better, but we have been trying to save up for a new house, so I think buying a crazy Sprinter van that we're never gonna use, it's really not the right time. It's not an office. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Meeting adjourned. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Call it what it is. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Do you smell that? Did you fart? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I swear I didn't fart. I swear to God it's my shirt. The dog's stench has just, like, taken over everything, and it's so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you know where my van is? &gt;&gt; DANIELLE: I have no idea. You'll just have to ask her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you speak to her, tell her to call me. That's not right! &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Kim! Take a look over here. Kim! Kim, over here! &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Should we let, uh... &gt;&gt; LISA: Where should I sit? &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: ...the mother hen sit in the middle? &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Are you liking the brunette? Back to the roots? &gt;&gt; KIM: I do. I liked it blond, too. I am so excited for the wedding. &gt;&gt; LISA: We have to make our reservation. What day are you going? How much in advance? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna go days before because I have dress fitting and all that good stuff, so... &gt;&gt; LISA: How many people? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just, like, 150. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Are you gonna have good food? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, really good food. &gt;&gt; LISA: Are you gonna have any single men there? This is my year. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I'm sure. &gt;&gt; LISA: This year, I'm telling you, next year I'm going to be married. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: It smells like crap. &gt;&gt; LISA: It smells like sulfur. Brittny? &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Not me. Do you smell that? Did you fart? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I swear I didn't fart. I swear to God it's my shirt. Smell my shirt. &gt;&gt; LISA: I'm not, I smell it. It's really sad. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, Kendall's dog, she has this huge Great Dane, and it's been hanging in the laundry room, and we put the dog in there before we go to bed. It really smells. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, great, thank you, thank you for sharing. &gt;&gt; KIM: It smells like &gt;&gt; LISA: You don't think you have one of North's dirty diapers in this bag? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's what it smells like. &gt;&gt; LISA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't even believe that the dog's stench has just, like, taken over everything. And it's so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; LISA: Like, how are you living like this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall does not take care of her dog, because my mom goes to bed so early, so she puts it in early. I mean, you guys know-- you have dogs. &gt;&gt; LISA: But our dogs are this big. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom gets up at 4:00 in the morning... &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: That's like a horse taking a &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and puts the dog out. It's literally a horse, but it's diarrhea-- wet, dirty, disgusting diarrhea. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: And all my stuff-- I swear, it smells like She just thinks my mom... &gt;&gt; WAITER: How are the tapas? &gt;&gt; KIM: Really good. &gt;&gt; WAITER: You ladies know what everything was? &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LISA: Do you smell her? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's this new perfume I've been testing out. Eau la... Eau du s---tay. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Did they tell you what everything was? &gt;&gt; KIM: Shut up, I don't want to, like, bring attention to it. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Well, I don't want him to think it's us, I mean, I don't want him to think it's me. &gt;&gt; LISA: It wouldn't be perfect Kim Kardashian, it would be me with the two dogs. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: You're going down. &gt;&gt; LISA: You're gonna... 'Cause we know mine are bad. &gt;&gt; BRITTNY: Oh, Ms. Perfect, you ain't so perfect tonight. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the? Where's my van? &gt;&gt; DANIELLE: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, it's Scott. Is Kourt there? &gt;&gt; DANIELLE: No, she's not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. Do you know where my van is? 'Cause it was in the driveway when I left, and I'm pulling up now and it's not here. &gt;&gt; DANIELLE: I mean, she's out running errands, so you'd just have to ask her. I have no idea. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you speak to her, tell her to call me. &gt;&gt; DANIELLE: I'll pass on those exact words. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank you. My mobile office-- it's gone. You know, it's not like a MINI Cooper or a motorcycle that could just get picked up and thrown. It's a damn bus. That's not right. unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like your hair. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: P, tell KoKo that you had two shots. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Did they hurt? Want to give North a kiss? Give North a kiss. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, she's obsessed with her. The other day, Kim had this photo shoot for her Web site or whatever, and Kendall was just, like, talking about Mom or whatever, complaining. And then Kim was like, "You're turning into a mini Khloe." mean. Mom was up at 1:00 a.m., crying, all night long. She's like, I'm just so tired of being all of your guys' mom. Like, everyone is so mean to me. I mean, I just think you're rubbing off on Kendall. So if you were mean to Mom, then she's gonna think it's okay to be mean to Mom. It's not fun for my mom when she gets attacked by Khloe, but I think she's used to it. But I think it just, like, stings even more when it comes from Kendall, because, you know, Kendall's her little sweet baby. And Khloe is just, you know, being a bad influence on her. I mean, Kendall and Kylie just, like, look up to you so much. They're just gonna see what you do and then do the same thing, and I just would hate for everyone to just start ganging up on Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, that's disgusting. Oh, my God, it's right there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Heard you wanted to see me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where's my bus? My mobile office? Where'd it go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How pretty is it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So pretty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's always helicopters, like, that, um, have to rescue people, 'cause people get, like, lost in these trails, I guess. Howdumb of them. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I would do that just for fun. Like, say I was lost and then have them come and get me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have to pay for it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, do you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, like when you ride in an ambulance, you know, you pay for it, later. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ew. Wow, what a rip-off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What a rip-off. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Step, step. Doggies. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hey, just to let you guys know, they're ticketing people if their dog's not on a leash and they're not licensed. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So just make sure... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: All right, thank you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, no problem. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What does that mean, being ticketed? I didn't know you could get ticketed for your dog. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, it's against... You have to have your dog on a leash and Blu has to have a... Like, a... an ID collar tag. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Does she not have one? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, she has one right there. It's the... the round one. It's the L.A. County dog license, it's on there. So didn't you register or do that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, someone did it for you, I'm sure Mom did. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why would she do that without telling me? I mean, she was probably... would she do that? It's... hello. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I mean, I like that she did it, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, you're mad that she actually did something nice for you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm not mad. It's just a little annoying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim is definitely right-- I've been bitchy to my mom for a while now, and I always say I want to work on it and I just never do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, Gabbana. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The dog hates you. Hi. Aw, this is my emotional turmoil taking over me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't make fun of me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think I might have walking pneumonia. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's stress. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Duh, dumb Sometimes I feel like I set a bad example for you and Kyles. I feel like we all attack her. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, but I feel like we're all on the same page with her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall is so sweet and I can tell that my bad attitude is definitely rubbing off. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, that is the most disgusting thing, that you wear that much makeup that even just placing your face on my sheets makes it come off. That's disgusting, leave my room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, I don't want to lead by a bad example-- I could show my mom a little more respect. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's a bug. Hi, bug. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I think my major mission in life is to be nicer to Mom. I feel like I'm just a to her. But sometimes it's so... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do you ever think about getting your mustache, like, plucked, or waxed or something? I pluck mine. But I just saw it in the sunlight. It was really gleaming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's blond hair. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, it's not, it's totally brown. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's brown. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I heard you wanted to see me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. Where's my bus? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your bus? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My mobile office? You know what I'm talking about. Where'd it go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom, do you have your party panties on? My mom has no idea what's in store for her tonight. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I feel so bad for her already. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's gonna love it. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: This is gonna... No, she's gonna love it... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She loves everyone. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: ...but this is gonna hurt tomorrow. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where's my bus? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your bus? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My mobile office? You know what I'm talking about. Where'd it go? It's big, it can't just go missing. It could? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe I had it all chopped up and sold each part, one by one. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You own a chop shop? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yup. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll invest in that business-- it's a good business. So where is the van? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The one that was blocking my driveway so I couldn't leave? This morning, when I tried to leave the house, I found Scott's mobile office blocking my car. So I called the dealership and I asked them to take back the mobile office early. I know Scott was trying to pretend that he needed this mobile office to have quiet space for his work, but who is he kidding? I returned it and I cancelled the lease. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You shouldn't leave thinking that, like, I'm not gonna leave all day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course I know that you go in and out of the house. I'm just saying, you know, you don't have to disrupt my bus. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have so many cars that you don't need, so you don't want to add another car that's really expensive. You've wanted that car for years, I've heard you talk about it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, it's a nice accessory. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So don't use us as an excuse-- that we're... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...distracting you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, you're not a distraction, I just wanted to buy a mobile home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Put a "Do Not Disturb" sign on the front of your office that nobody will listen to. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's not gonna do anything, no one listens to me here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wish Kourtney was a bit more supportive of my mobile office, but, yeah, it was more of just a distraction and kind of one more thing I wanted to get to take my mind off of other things probably. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, well, I'm glad you're in good spirits. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not in that good a spirits. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got a spray tan, and it really didn't do much, but it did something. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm. So pretty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ken? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We've been so mean to Mom. I feel like I'm setting a really bad example because I am such a bitch, and it's not okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I just feel like it's how we are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but I feel like I'm such a bad influence, and... I mean, sometimes it's funny, but I think, like, too much, it gets a little overwhelming. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, and she's pretty sensitive. I feel like she takes it personally. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She does so many things that even, like, we're not, like, aware of, too. Like, even, like, her getting, like, Blu her collar. Like, she does little things for me all the time. We have to be more aware and be, like, nicer to her. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! Where is she? In her room? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. I think so. Let's go say "hi" to her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mommy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. What... What's going on? You smell good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's-what's up, guys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, too. Are you okay? Have you been drinking? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ow... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you all right, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall and I are gonna make a pact-- pinkie swear-- that we're gonna be nicer to you and more appreciative, but tell you. 'Cause we are appreciative. We just don't tell you enough... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...how grateful we are and how much we love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thanks for registering Blu. I get that Khloe and I are often hard on my mom. I know I complain about her a lot, but I am 18 years old. I need to start taking more responsibility for things. At the end of the day, I'm always thankful for everything my mom has done for me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We just want to be nicer to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS &amp; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, that's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's like a spider slash ant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's right there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Baby got back. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Where was this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Going to dinner the other day, or lunch with my sisters. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, okay. Oh! You know what? I was gonna wear, like, this orangey kind of lipstick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This orangey kind of lipstick. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe, leave me alone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom is gonna kill us 'cause we're late. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Just so you know, when your mother freaks out about where we're taking her, I'm going to blame all of this on you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have your party panties on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't have any underwear on at all. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Ooh, get it, girl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! Party it up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I just have a little dress on with some boots. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That is perfect. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It is? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna look so cute. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yes. You always look amazing. You... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you always look gorg. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: We are not worried about you. We are just gonna have a blast. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like I owe my mom more than just an apology, so, I'm gonna take her to where all her dreams will come true. : Okay, get ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom has no idea what's in store for her tonight. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I feel so bad for her already. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? She's gonna love it. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: 'Cause this is gonna... No, she's gonna love it, but this is gonna hurt tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She loves everyone. Oh, she'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is exciting. So, what part of town are we going to, ladies? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are just like me. Like, you need full control. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are we checking in somewhere? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You just never know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You never know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are we going on a road trip? Are we going to the Hollywood sign? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like you're asking a lot of questions. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I am. Khloe and Malika basically kidnap me and tell me we're going on a surprise. I don't know where I'm going. Are we going to Capital Records? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe. I'll get you a record deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Or the Knickerbocker. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've been punked. You're getting fired. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For all I know, I could end up in a desert somewhere by myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, now we're in Hollywood. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're not in the Valley anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're not in Kansas anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dorothy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Diddy will be proud of you tonight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are we gonna see Diddy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think he's here. He's out with French Montana, and he's in Miami, actually. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hollywood Boulevard. Oh, we are living. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Mm-hmm. honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, then, I wore the right boots. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come, come. Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. : Look who's here. Oh, my God. Hi. &gt;&gt; THE GAME: I like this little number you got. How you doing? At least we wore, like, different materials. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: The same... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; THE GAME: With a little leather. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're coordinated. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're coordinated. &gt;&gt; THE GAME: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look so good. &gt;&gt; THE GAME: You like? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I love it. &gt;&gt; THE GAME: I like it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are we going? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She has no idea what's happening. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. Is this how Khloe hangs out? Where did all these people come from? And where are we going? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, work it out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going to a club! ♫ ♫ Oh, my gosh. So, because I brought up a club, now Khloe is surprising me by taking me to a club with her and Malika and all their friends, and, you know what? It's actually really cool, and looks like a lot of fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom gets to let her hair down and drink as much as she wants, get wild. It's so cute. Scott's here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I heard you were coming out! &gt;&gt; THE GAME: Hold up! Kris Jenner got something to say about the twerk. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, kids. I just wanted to say, I thought it would be a really cool idea to have a little twerk contest. What do you think? Let's go! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom really is a phenomenal, amazing woman. She takes on so much. I don't know how she does it. I don't know why she wants to do it, but I definitely think she deserves more credit. And she is the glue that holds this family together. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's ready to see their new house? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yay! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going back to the other house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna have to move without her. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom and I have been invited as the guests to one of Austria's most well-known entrepreneurs. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hi, Kim! Hi, Kim! It's me. It's me Kanye! &gt;&gt; KIM: We see a guy that is dressed in blackface. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: ...to dance, we wait for "in Vienna." &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Did he say what I think he just said? Everything from this trip has just been a true nightmare. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was incredibly inappropriate. I'm at my limit, and we just need to get the hell out of here.
