- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was thinking about seeing Todd one more time. Todd Waterman is the guy who I left Robert Kardashian for. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why you're even talking to your ex-boyfriend is just beyond me. You just hope that there's no feelings left. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes I think maybe there is another chapter for me. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Without Bruce? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I never knew how I was gonna feel if I ever ran into you again. &gt;&gt; TODD: Right. Same here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you looking at me like that? &gt;&gt; TODD: This is pretty romantic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you trying to inch closer to me? That's all I want to know. &gt;&gt; TODD: Kris, you know, I was wondering who was the first that was gonna go there tonight, if it was gonna be you or me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. There's a lot of things that have been left unsaid, and I need some closure to this whole relationship in order to go on with the rest of my life. &gt;&gt; TODD: You know what I remember, is how you used to clean my sunglasses. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; TODD: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what you thought of me all these years? &gt;&gt; TODD: To this day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is just how I used to clean sunglasses? sunglasses. And you don't remember that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't. &gt;&gt; TODD: Let's get out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; TODD: What room are we in? Are you tipsy yet? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; TODD: Can we just do some shots? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. I can't. &gt;&gt; TODD: Come on! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't. Some things just never change. I'm not really quite sure why I've built this up in my mind to be such, um, a fantasy. Don't you think that, on some level, it would be really cool to walk away as friends? Like to feel like this is meant to be to gain some closure? &gt;&gt; TODD: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And, you know, you were very young. We were at two different places, and we needed to part for many reasons, and then I met Bruce like three weeks later. It was crazy. &gt;&gt; TODD: I don't want to talk about it anymore. It's upsetting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Closure is a bitch. &gt;&gt; TODD: Stop with the closure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that this dinner has taught me a lot of things. And it's nice to know that I made the right decision. And I'm just really glad that I'm going home to Bruce Jenner. The grass isn't always greener. &gt;&gt; TODD: Oh, that's not good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but it's kind of true. Here's to moving on. &gt;&gt; TODD: All right, moving on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey? Can you put a shirt on and come out? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I don't want to come out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. We need to come... You need to come out here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel this urgency to wake Bruce up and tell him exactly what happened tonight, because I feel like it's unfair to him to let one more minute go by, and he not know exactly how I feel. Honestly, I have had a revelation. Obviously, this isn't easy. So... tonight was the night that I had to meet up with Todd again. I wanted to tell you that tonight I realized I really appreciate you a lot more. I may have been fantasizing about somebody for the last 23 years that didn't really deserve that kind of recognition. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's showering me with all these great, lovely things, but she went behind my back. I'm not excited about this. That's for sure. What an idiot you are. I don't even know how I can trust you. I can't believe you did this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is a good thing. This is like good news. I know, but... This is definitely not the reaction that I thought I 70 00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,474 would get. Just trying to tell him how much I appreciate him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you one huge leopard roaming the streets? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have to take everything out, though, to go through it? &gt;&gt; KIM: What is this jumpsuit, honey? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Anxiety! &gt;&gt; KIM: That has got to go. Oh, oh. Honey, is this a dress or a shirt? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is like hell. I'm getting anxiety. I appreciate the help, but it's a little excessive. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. What about these? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Lamar, I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You are? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I... See you later. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Lamar has a cavity. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Duh. He has like 20, I'm sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I could smell it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure. Bible. He won't go to the dentist. &gt;&gt; KIM: My sixth sense is coming. I have this like sixth sense where I can smell if someone has a cavity, and everyone knows Lamar loves candy. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Sharp Mike's. ♫ Oh, Tasty Bakeshop Tasty Bakeshop ♫ I do have a sweet tooth. I'll start with these. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, you can't eat it yet! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yan't get the first bite. It's not your cake! &gt;&gt; KIM: He needs to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, he's afraid of the dentist. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's gonna get really bad, trust me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So what do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, we need to like force him to, 'cause like he'll have no teeth. He'll be like, "Bye, Khloe." &gt;&gt; Lock her out. Kourtney, this is not a dress you should be in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Guess what. Getting dressed is not fun, so whatever I wear every day-- get used to it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna yell at me for making fun of a... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, you can leave right now, because I have to talk to Khloe and Kim privately. We'll talk to you later. I want to talk to these girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not leaving. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, this is a personal thing. It's not business. Kourtney seems to be the most judgmental of me, so I don't want to feel that judgment coming down on me for something I'm trying to do for myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's kind of rude to kick her out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's so rude. She's immobile and pregnant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly why she doesn't need to hear what this personal thing is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you have to say? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I saw him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Todd. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Why? Does Bruce know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I told him after. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What a little whore. Why would you even give someone the satisfaction? Wouldn't you just want him to think that you don't even know he exists? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KIM: So much crazy like went on, and cheating and stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wasn't doing anything shady. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just feel like you're lying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so annoying that nobody seems to believe what I'm trying to tell them. I did it for closure. to do it for closure, but you didn't do it for that. My mom has this history with Todd, and I think her logic just doesn't really make sense. I really want you to take a lie detector test. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A lie detector test? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll take any kind of a damn test you want me to take because I am so confident... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want you to take an STD test, 'cause I'm sure you have a few of those. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really, honestly don't know what to believe anymore with my mom, but maybe she should take a lie detector test and prove it to us. We seriously need to call Maury Povich. Did you touch his penis under the table with your foot? 146 00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:36,790 &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are torturous and not funny anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm upstairs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ♫ Comin' ♫ What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just touching up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is your nail color? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you like it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe had a little lamb-lamb. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. I like that. Speaking of lamb-lambs, did Lamb-lamb go to the dentist? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, not yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tell me about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. How do you smell his breath? How do you kiss him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all, he doesn't have bad breath. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, I almost throw up in my mouth every time I give him a hug. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you don't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say, "Bible." &gt;&gt; KIM: Bible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you say something to him? 'Cause then he'll take it seriously. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm honestly shocked that Khloe has not gotten Lamar to go to the dentist. I'm gonna literally kidnap him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kidnap. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say, "Lam, you got... 169 00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,449 You smell likeand you're making me throw up." &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, you're so gross. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; MASON: Roar! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want the... You want the lamb back? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yes. Please, have that, please? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; MASON: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, guys, I think we should like come up with the questions of what we're gonna ask this lie detector person. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm afraid. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shall we call him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yep. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Is this Joseph? &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Yes. And you are? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney. We're calling you on a three-way. So we found this amazing guy, Joseph, who has been a part of the Secret Service. He worked with the Kennedys. He's been in the business for 40 years, and we think he would be perfect to give my mom the lie detector test. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We were curious about some of the lie detector questions and how we have to word them. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: I'll try to give you a little, brief explanation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: It's a mixture of relevant questions and irrelevant questions. Like if I was testing you, Kim, my first question would be, "Is your first name Kim?" Now I have a pretty good baseline of what you look like on non-truthful questions. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we'll narrow down to five or six. We'll write them out. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Yeah. And then give me a call, and I'll write 'em all out and we'll be all set. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I'm looking forward to meeting you, and thank you for doing this for us. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Okay. Take care. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I'll, in my notepad right here, I'm gonna make notes. Do you... still love Todd? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you still have sexual intercourse? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you having an affair with Todd? Are you in love with your husband? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want her to answer some of these. I'm afraid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We know that we're playing with fire, and we might not want to know some of the real answers to these questions, but if she really has nothing to hide, then she shouldn't be worried about answering them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's wrong? Your teeth-- 'cause you need to go to the dentist. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come here. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Rob! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm trying to help you! Listen, listen, listen, if I make you the appointment, will you go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm the criminal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Are you in love with Todd Waterman? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, do you see Kim's car that she has in the front yard? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Lamar can't fit in it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's dope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have yogurt on your nose. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Okay. Look at that detail. Oh, suicide... Main ambitious. &gt;&gt; KIM: Right? Pretty cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Baby. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's wrong? Your teeth-- 'cause you need to go to the dentist. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Just... I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Baby? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Lamar... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Nah, this... it was just hot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to go to thedentist. You &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, you do have to go to the dentist, baby. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously, now that it's your off time, you've got to go. Let me see you go like this. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lamar, what's wrong with your teeth? Come here. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Rob! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm trying to help you! Okay, you don't have to show me your teeth, but I'm just telling you... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Rob? &gt;&gt; KIM: They'll put you to sleep. It is so funny to see such a big man like squirm over the word "dentist." Like he is so afraid to even just get a checkup, like a teeth cleaning, anything. So I am gonna make this my mission-- he has to go. All you have to do is get like two veneers, fix all your cavities-- he'll do it all in one. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I need my cavities... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He won't do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: If I make you the appointment, will you go? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No. I'm afraid of the dentist, because I know most likely I'm gonna have to get a lot of work done, and, um, 'cause it hurts. But I'm just scared. Rob, they're bothering me. &gt;&gt; KIM: They'll literally put you to sleep, have an anesthesiologist there. You won't have to hear a tool. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'll do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You swear you'll do it? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I swear. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. You're going 257 00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:55,908 this Friday. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No! &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have brittle nails. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I've got to fix my nails. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A little Cuomo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How did you feel, that Mom went to dinner with Todd, and then didn't even tell you till after? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It kind of ticks me off that she would do that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what I said. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And not tell me. I don't even know what issue she would have with him, 22 years later. Move on. I'm telling you this-- your mother will probably kill me-- this is right after we had gotten married. She goes, "I just want you to know, never trust me." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? said that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sounds about right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would she say that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. That's what I said, the same thing. Why would she say that? And that was the only time she said it, so it always registered in the back of my mind. There's always that little thing saying, "Never trust her." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's why she's taking a lie detector test today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've never been a big believer in lie detector tests, until this time. It's really gonna be interesting to see what the results are. To see, uh, you know, if she is lying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like Mom... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's that high horse? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Will be excited to take the lie detector test-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom will be excited for any attention you put on her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what I'm saying. It's like the highlight of her week. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: I think the guy's here. We should go inside. Hi, how are you? I'm Kim. Come on in. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Okay, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Oh, nice to be here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello, Joseph. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm Bruce. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Khloe? Glad to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. How are you? Nice to see you. I'm the criminal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I definitely think that doing a lie detector test is over-the-top dramatic, but if it makes everybody see that I'm not lying or not being shady, then so be it. Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shaking in your boots, aren't you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not really. Bring it on. Oh, my. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: I'm not getting fresh with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's okay. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: It's just the way it is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I ask this question? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: So my sisters and I have been coming up with the best questions to ask my mom, and we're just finalizing our list. I'm just anxious to find out the truth about these questions. Okay. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: You ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm ready. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Okay, now try not to move. Are you in California now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Is Kim your favorite daughter? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The lie detector professional explained to us that when the lie detector meter doesn't move as much, that means that your heart rate is more at ease, and when the meter starts to move or jump, that means that you're either lying, over-thinking something, or your heart rate starts racing. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Have you ever taken more than your cut from any of your daughters' deals? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. These are sick &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Is Robert Kardashian Khloe's biological father? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Do you regret having an affair on your ex-husband, Robert Kardashian? 330 00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:45,505 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Are you in love with Todd Waterman? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Okay. Would you like to have an affair with Todd? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. 335 00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:09,896 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The machine is going crazy over there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, it... I saw it jump when he asked if you wanted to have an affair with Todd Waterman. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I don't. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Some of the questions seem to, um, cause a little bit of an emotional distress. Because outwardly you might not have any feelings for the person, but inwardly something might come up that you remembered something pleasant, so it's just hard to give a strict "yes" or "no" on a question like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's definitely a relief to hear that she could just have some emotional history behind the answer, and that is why the needle is moving around. So I'm glad to know that she is being truthful. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: You did very good. &gt;&gt; KIM: You passed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. See? Now do you guys believe me? Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: I knew I was your favorite daughter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. I passed the lie detector test. Hopefully my family will realize that I've been telling the truth all along, and they'll leave me alone. Hey, honey. I passed my test. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I was down there and I saw one of those little needles just bouncing around all over the place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He said I passed. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm not gonna give you five until you explain to me, why did you go see this guy? You never told me why you were going... why you were so happy and all of a sudden back in love with me. You just kept confessing how great I was. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, why did you do that in the first place? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. Don't ask me that question. But the good news is... is how great I felt after the dinner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Great. I'm glad you felt good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did. That was a major revelation. Like that was a huge, big deal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoopee. This whole thing is just ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Well, nothing I do is ever good enough, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll let you just think about that then. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DENTIST: Now I know why they call him the candy man. It's his wisdom tooth. So he's not gonna miss it. Now comes the fun part. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that? &gt;&gt; DENTIST: The root canal. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We have had our differences, but I don't think it's ever been as bad as it's 382 00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,535 been lately. &gt;&gt; BURT: Have you guys talked about like separating? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Baby, I'm gonna be there the whole time. I brought you a blankie. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: We're going to the dentist. I'm nervous. I'm trying to block it out. I really hate going to the dentist. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's really getting nervous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, I came for the moral support. Why are you nervous? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is amazing. Have you ever met Dr. Sands? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're gonna thank me later. This is Khloe. &gt;&gt; SANDS: Nice to see you. Kevin Sands. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hey, what's up, Doc? &gt;&gt; SANDS: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: How you doing? &gt;&gt; SANDS: Oh, great. I hear you're pretty nervous. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, yeah. I'm not a big fan of the dentist. &gt;&gt; SANDS: The only thing you're gonna be awake for is the x-rays. I'll just guide you through the whole process. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have an anesthesiologist here to knock you out. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: All right. &gt;&gt; SANDS: Right over here. I should have got the extended chair. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's all good. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: And a big smile. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Such a miserable smile. &gt;&gt; SANDS: There's an area right here. See how it's really dark? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SANDS: So that's a cavity. You're not having any pain? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Right here? &gt;&gt; SANDS: Yeah. Okay. So you're gonna feel so much better after it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Well, let's get the goings going on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, let's get the goings going on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Put him out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Sweet dreams. How do you feel? &gt;&gt; SANDS: You never thought the dentist was so fun, man. Look what you've been missing out. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You guys got the coolest jobs in the world. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SANDS: That's where I'll fly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sandwiches outside? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause he's a dentist? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Makes a lot of money, dresses nice. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whatever they're putting into this IV is phenomenal crazy town He is so funny. He's so loopy. He's having the best time ever at the dentist. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I think that we can... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is he really asleep? &gt;&gt; SANDS: Megan, we're all ready. &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you. &gt;&gt; SANDS: Now I know why they call him "The Candy Man." Khloe, this is Dr. Baradaran. &gt;&gt; BOTH: Hi. &gt;&gt; BARADARAN: Hello. &gt;&gt; BOTH: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; BARADARAN: It's his wisdom tooth. So he's not gonna miss it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right. &gt;&gt; BARADARAN: He must have been in a lot of pain. We're wriggle-wiggling it out. There's a lot of decay. &gt;&gt; SANDS: Wow, it's a boy. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you guys doing now? &gt;&gt; SANDS: Now comes the fun part. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that? &gt;&gt; SANDS: The root canal. So now we have Dr. Monempour, the premier Beverly Hills root canal specialist. 444 00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:30,683 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, he did mine. He's so cute. Be nice to him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Done? &gt;&gt; MEGAN: Done. Come back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I am high. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are high? &gt;&gt; ANESTHESIOLOGIST: You did great. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Show me your teeth. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: My grandma always used to tell me I have nice teeth. &gt;&gt; You were here for such a long time. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like seven hours. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You had probably six different dentists come in here. &gt;&gt; SANDS: We got everything done-- eight cavities, a root canal, an extraction. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want you could see how much whiter your teeth are. Look at your tooth. It was decayed like that. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Whoa. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You got some good in here, bro. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SANDS: Wow. I think you got taller. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come with me. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I feel so much better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? Good. Here. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I would have came to the doctor every day if I knew it was like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This has been years in the making of getting Lamar to go to the dentist. And now he says he wants to come here every weekend. Kim did it. Kim got him to go to the dentist. And I am so thankful for Kim. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I might just start chipping my own tooth... &gt;&gt; SANDS: Yeah! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Just to come back in here and sit in that chair. Take care, bro. &gt;&gt; SANDS: We're BFF now. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: BFF now. We are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you guys really are. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I definitely won't let six, seven years pass before I go to the dentist again. I'm glad I went through with it. Who likes living in pain where I can't eat ice cream, drink hot chocolate? To hell with that. I'm gonna definitely take care of my teeth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Damn... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Don't keep touching it. But don't touch it. Okay, shut the door. 483 00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:17,957 &gt;&gt; LAMAR: BFF, bro. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; BURT: Out to sea again. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, the surf's kind of good. &gt;&gt; BURT: But it has the corner right there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. You guys have been surfing, but I never really got into the surfing thing. &gt;&gt; BURT: You tried teaching me a long time ago. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I remember that, yeah. &gt;&gt; BURT: Scary as hell. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. But anyway, it's nice to be here. Nice and peaceful here on the beach. &gt;&gt; BURT: It is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It hasn't been very peaceful at the house. &gt;&gt; BURT: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris is driving me absolutely insane. &gt;&gt; BURT: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, her at me, and then I'm at her, then I get her off. It just goes back and forth and back and forth. The girls even had her take a lie detector test. &gt;&gt; BURT: For what, like asking her what kind of questions? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, the old Todd thing came up. &gt;&gt; BURT: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She goes out and has dinner with him. She wanted to go over to hash over some old stuff. &gt;&gt; BURT: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BURT: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And didn't know that. We certainly have had our differences over the years, but I don't think it's ever been 509 00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,532 as bad as it has been lately. &gt;&gt; BURT: Have you guys talked about like separating or...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know what to do. I'm like lost. &gt;&gt; ROB: Wearing a beanie. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thinning hair is because of a beanie. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim makes these comments like "You're balding. Your hair's thinning." Just like giving me a complex. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just don't be so nasty all the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're gonna have to force them to get over this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here's the house. 519 00:25:56,255 --> 00:26:00,292 It's like right on the beach. They could like rekindle that old spark. &gt;&gt; ROB: I have an appearance in Vegas, and I'm flying with my mom, Kim, Kendall, and Kylie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One... two... three. Got it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You should put powder in your hair. &gt;&gt; ROB: No. I don't need it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't need it? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, first of all, I was just wearing a beanie, so if you think there's something wrong with my hair, it's 'cause my hair is probably all jacked up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: Fixing it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thinning hair is because of a beanie. &gt;&gt; ROB: It really bugs me that Kim makes these comments like, "You're balding, your hair's thinning," 'cause it's just like giving me a complex. And she says it right before I'm about to walk on a red carpet, so now I'm worrying about my hair, and it sucks. Do you think I'm balding? &gt;&gt; LIZ: Where? &gt;&gt; NOELLE: No. &gt;&gt; LIZ: I don't think you're balding, but I can see where they can like see your scalp there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't you think you need to be proactive? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'll get a Do you guys have something for hair loss or like a type of shampoo-conditioner, like organic stuff? &gt;&gt; CLERK: Yeah, we do. It's, uh, right over here. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott and I go to the store to buy vitamins and shampoo and conditioner to make your hair fuller and prevent hair loss. I'm just trying to like be cautious. &gt;&gt; CLERK: It would be this product here-- the shampoo, and then that's the conditioner. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, cool. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I used to use this as a kid. &gt;&gt; CLERK: Are you open to another product, or you only-- &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm good. My hair's flowing in the wind. It's him that I'm worried about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: These jugs are really becoming spectacular visions. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, but what is all these bills from our trademark attorneys? I don't understand. Look. Here's the house. It's like right on the beach. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's like a cute, little cottage, but it's on the beach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's beautiful. What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just where they have to be together sitting... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Anything on the water with that romantic vibe and like have a glass of wine outside with the wind, the waves crashing. &gt;&gt; KIM: But are we setting them up to like kill themselves? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I hope not. I think it's kind of clear that my mom and Bruce are not gonna work this out on their own, so, you know, my sisters and I-- we're gonna have to force them to get over this and do it quickly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I feel like when Mom and Bruce-- whenever they talk about when they first met, and it was love at first sight. Then they would like French kiss at all times and like share each other's food. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They would eat steak, one of them, and swap it out of the other one's mouth. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: One would chew, one would swallow. Like I feel like-- but when they remember all those old memories, they could like rekindle that old spark. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They could have sex on the beach? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you think? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do they even have sex anymore? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They have to have sex. Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like when do you stop having sex in life? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's only 60- something. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Maybe like 80. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ROB: One of my sisters has been really making me insecure about my hair. I honestly didn't think anything was wrong. &gt;&gt; SIMANTOUB: Let's check it out. Yeah, your hair is going slighter thinner. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have planned a magical weekend vacation for 590 00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:51,356 you two to Malibu. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have things I have to do at home. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: I need to go through some things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; ROB: I need to see what your dad's hair was like when he was my age. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My dad's hair? &gt;&gt; ROB: I did some research, and I heard that hair loss can be hereditary from your mom's side. So I'm at my mom's because I want to look at her father whom I never met and kind of got an idea of what his hair was like. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look it-- that's me when I was a baby. And that's me. Aren't I cute? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't want to see pictures of you; I want to see pictures of your dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't have any. There he is! Right there! He didn't have the thickest hair in the world. &gt;&gt; ROB: Her dad, to me, has a full head of hair, but then she's trying to like convince me that his hair was thinning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a lot of hair. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but isn't it about your dad kind of determines it, or is that just a myth? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's where you get it, right here. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh, is that Aunt Joan? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, she looked so pretty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Rob, that's way too much... Okay. Good. &gt;&gt; ROB: She isn't; it's Uncle 616 00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,801 Tom's wife. It's not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. That's enough. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, this looks so beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: I cooked long and hard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I haven't had a hot dog in a long time. I'm going for a hot dog. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim has invited us all over for a barbecue, and I'm going to do my best today to try to be civil with Bruce in front of the other kids. &gt;&gt; Rob: I cook every night at Khloe and Lamar's, you know that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get out of here. &gt;&gt; ROB: I do steak, baked potato, green beans-- that's one of my things. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why didn't you ever cook when you were around the house? &gt;&gt; ROB: My second one is the pasta that you do with the peppers and all that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So what did you do today, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Same as I always do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I was just trying to be nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I fly helicopters in the morning, and then I go hit some balls. And then I come over here. Well, I do the same thing every day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, thank you so much. I think we should go home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, wait. The reason I really brought you here is, we need to tell you this. We have planned a magical weekend vacation for you two to Malibu. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have things I have to do at home. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't care if you guys drown each other in the ocean outside and kill each other. You're going to Malibu. My mom and Bruce are obviously going through a tough time. This is just like things I think people get separated over. They met in Malibu for the first time, so we want to do whatever we can to help them get some of that passion back that they used to have. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is the stuff in the car already? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's all in the car. Get out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How do you know what we even want? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Trust me, I asked all your assistants. I'm a good stylist. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Even though this seems a little silly, Bruce and I probably could use this as a couple. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, this ought to be exciting, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, boy. Hi, Sam. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: Hey. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm looking for Dr. Johan. &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: You're here for a consultation? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. My whole family thinks like I'm going to go bald within two years, so all these vitamins and all that crap isn't gonna do So I'm at this hair loss center, and I gotta figure out, you know, something better to do. &gt;&gt; SIMANTOUB: Johan. Pleased to meet you. Have you done anything so far for your hair? &gt;&gt; ROB: Um, I just-- one of my sisters have been really making me insecure about my hair. I honestly didn't think anything was wrong. I mean, naturally, my family has thin hair. &gt;&gt; SIMANTOUB: Men go through hair loss in mid- to late-20s. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SIMANTOUB: Over time, if it's ignored, it could develop to be more extensive, so there's... could be more thinning hair. Where's your area of concern? Is it in the front, the crown or all over? &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, it's just on my mind, and I wanted to like get a, you know, professional's opinion-- Do you think I'm balding, which some people like may think... &gt;&gt; SIMANTOUB: Let's check it out. Yeah, your hair's going slightly thinner. You can do some preventative measures for it to slow down the falling or thickening the hair follicles, okay? You can use laser hair growth therapy. There's Propecia that you could use. It does have some side effects. &gt;&gt; ROB: He pretty much is just telling me, "Contain the hair that you have and make it fuller," so I really don't know what to believe, who to believe, what to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce is downstairs on the couch. I'm upstairs in the bed, and if we can't enjoy a romantic weekend together in a place like this, then what else is left? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing in here? What is that thing? &gt;&gt; ROB: A toy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, that thing. "Revitalizer." What does this do? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's for your hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just comb it? &gt;&gt; ROB: Makes it fuller. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way. How does this work? "Use slowly, half inch, every four seconds"-- What?! One, two, three, four. This, I would just kill myself. &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe's just constantly making fun of all these dumb products that I have. And it is pretty hurtful. You all are saying it to me, so you're not making it any better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Weeks eight through 12..." So you're supposed to do this every day. Four seconds on every half-inch, every day. &gt;&gt; ROB: I was trying something different. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, I think you don't need this. I think you're tripping out. 707 00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:50,749 &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm getting so tired. You just gotta get out of my room already. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. This is pretty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hmm. Looks nice. What do you do here for two days? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Looks pretty out there. You want to come out there? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a little cold. It seems like, right now, we've brought all the troubles from home right here to Malibu. I'll check out the TV, make sure it's working properly. 716 00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:37,629 What I've been through the last couple of weeks... may take some more time to decompress. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, night one of our romantic getaway doesn't seem to be that successful because, somehow, Bruce is downstairs on the couch, and I'm upstairs in the bed, and I'm just a little, you know, disappointed. The time that the kids thought we could come together and have a great time just isn't panning out. If we can't enjoy a romantic weekend together in a place like this, then what else is left? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at those surfers out there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, that's where the girls went to Malibu Surf Camp. That's where Kendall and Kylie would have been. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Man, time flies. You making coffee? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Wait, how do you take your coffee again? It's been a long time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It has been. A little cream and sugar. Like real sugar. See, you push "brew," honey. Did you put water in it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Brew? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you put water in it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I put water in it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just don't be so nasty all the time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not nasty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, you're nasty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I guess I'll just watch TV? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't drink another one of those, please. That makes youlike no tomorrow. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What? It's a laxative. I'm gonna put it in the refrigerator for a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think you should... talk to Rob about his bald. &gt;&gt; ROB: About my what? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: He's not going bald. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Make him feel better. Tell him about your hair. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't think his is going bald. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think I'm fine. I'm just saying, what if I need to... eventually, cut it all off? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's funny, I remember, I was 19 years old, and I'm like, "Oh," Like I just, my hair was just like really, really light right here. But I got lucky. I came right along just in time where Michael Jordan came along. He made it fashionable, and I been bald ever since. When I was in college, I had to give a speech, so I videotaped the speech. I get back home, put it on. I'm like, "Oh," Like, like right here was like extra, extra light. So I called my two roommates in the room. I'm like, "Yo, am I buggin', or is mygoing bald?" And they just started laughing. Right there, put me in the chair... I was19, dude. And I hadwaves. I was a pretty boy. You gotta learn how to just roll with the punches, like I did. Your hair's fine right now. If it ever becomes a problem, you gotta deal with it then. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't even know like what I was thinking. I got annoyed because Kim was like, "You're balding. Your hair's thinning." When it comes to the time, like I have no problem doing it. I have no problem shaving my head, going all the way low. I mean, I'm a guy, so... it's not really a big deal to me. Look at you, you got a beautiful bald head. Lamar's really opening my eyes. It's not worth it to just like be down because you're losing hair. At the end of the day, you're not gonna like drag on your whole life worrying about your hair. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: So why would somebody say that you're going bald, and you're not? Just towith you a little bit? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, no, I agree. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: They kind butting in just a little bit? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, just to give people a complex. They keep saying myis really big, and I'm like... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's a little crazy. But on that note, I think I'm gonna go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Watching the sky. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, look what I found. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is that book that Kim said that we had to look at today. Oh, my God, look at you. Look how long your hair is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: '91-- that's after we just met. Look how young we were. God... My gosh, that was our honeymoon. Ooh... our first date, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Going through all these pictures reminds me of what a great life Bruce and I have had. They make up the whole fabric of our marriage. But, in the meantime, life happened and kids happened and business happened, and all the things we do got in the way. You know what the difference between now and then is? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We used to put our relationship first. We used to, it used to be about you and me... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And nothing else. And we used to have so much fun. Look at all these places that we visited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How can we put you and me first? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to get it back on track so that we really care again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I agree. I agree. Wholeheartedly I agree. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Actions are stronger than words. Let's have a toast. Come on, honey. To how fabulous our life used to be, is, and is going to be. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you, too. Look at this. It's really cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wonder how many minutes it takes for the sun to go down, like altogether. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It takes a while. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So this is what I'm thinking-- I'll meet you upstairs. Yeah? 814 00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:18,429 Okay, Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Life's good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Life is really good. Next on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If people could have kids in caves, why not have it at your house? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely wanna see this water birth for myself. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, she said she literally thinks she was gonna die? My grandmother is getting sicker and sicker. 823 00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:41,980 &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what scares me. I don't know how to live without my mom.
