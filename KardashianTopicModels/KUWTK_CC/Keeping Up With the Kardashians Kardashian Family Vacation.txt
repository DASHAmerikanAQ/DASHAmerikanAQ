- &gt;&gt; KIM: Previously on<i>Keeping</i> <i>Up With The Kardashians:</i> Hey, babe. About to pick up my Bentley. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:<i>Bentley.</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: How much longer, then? 'Cause we have to be at... &gt;&gt; 15 minutes, ten minutes. &gt;&gt; 15 more minutes, ten more minutes. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's taking forever to get my car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He agreed to do something, so he shouldn't be throwing it in your face. If you say you're gonna do something, then do it! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The guy yells at Khloe, and Kim doesn't defend her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, and you'll get in the car. And stop being rude and a brat. It's not funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will never look at you the same. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're trying to ruin my moment for me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People control her. She doesn't defend us. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't be so rude! I'll hurt you. Don't do that! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's bad enough that the girls are fighting, but now I think Bruce is going through a midlife crisis. A family vacation may be just the ticket. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go to Breckenricdge. I love it! &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't feel like being with them. I don't feel like laughing, skiing and snowboarding with them. I think we need time apart. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! How cool, I get to drive a Hummer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The Hummer? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, and the kids go in the other car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why did you get a Hummer? That's, like, so strange. Kimmy, you go with them, honey. I want you to go make up with your sisters in the car. You have two hours, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Two hours, exactly. I don't want to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go, Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim and I just have a lot of tensions between us. None of us have ever really apologized for the whole Bentley situation; us fighting, arguing. This is for the cool people. So, I'm pushing her buttons. People that can't afford Bentleys ride this car. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Guys, I can't take this. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My parents make us all ride together 'cause they think we're gonna make up, but we're not going to. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's going to go with this car and you're gonna get along, so get in the car. These girls really need to change their attitudes because this vacation is not starting out the way that I had imagined. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! I love this car! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't you think it looks good? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, honey, it's just not very you, Mr. Conservative- I-Drive-a-Black-Truck. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Driving up to skiing in our Hummer. ? I got the Hummer blues. ? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, don't sing like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I cannot believe Bruce wanted to get the Hummer. He's definitely... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who doesn't want a hummer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, what do you mean, like, a road Hummer or, like, a driving hummer? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're talking about the car? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm talking about the car Hummer. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I thought you meant a a good ol' humdinger. &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The cabin is amazing. I love it. It is right out of a picture book. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bunk beds. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim could sleep in here, the worst room. Kim, your bunk bed's downstairs. Where am I sleeping? Mom, I don't know what to do because there's only one queen bed, but I'm not sleeping with Kim. This might be difficult for you guys, but you guys work it out. Everyone's just giving me the cold shoulder. I want to talk to someone who wants to talk to me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kimberly, what's online that you have to immediately get online? &gt;&gt; KIM: iChat. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: iChat? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who are you gonna...? iChat with? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: With my boyfriend. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kimberly is driving me nuts. She's physically here, but mentally, she's computerized and she's going here. It's like she's not even with &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...so we can bond. If I go upstairs in my room and get on my computer, will you iChat with me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No texting, no nothing, no computers. Let's just ski and have a good time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim's kind of hiding in her iChatting, so I'm frustrated. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at the cabin I'm &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what? I don't even think we need to ski. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We could just do it online. We could ski online. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce is mad at me that the first thing I do is I come in and I'm iChatting. The one thing that makes me happy is talking to my boyfriend. Do you see that I have a new effect? &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm trying to escape the fact that they're all so mean to It seems like nobody wants me to be happy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyonehave fun! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah, those fit perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When you're going snowboarding, you gotta have the whole outfit. You gotta get into the snowboard culture. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You could easily be a snowboard instructor. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow, that's crazy. His outfit is probably appropriate for a 20-year-old, but I feel bad because he's trying so hard to look cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is it hot? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You look good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a little crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Snowboarding heaven! Let's go. Kris likes me young and hip. I think she likes the snowboard outfit. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Doesn't he look like a snowboard instructor? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; Slide and slip. Slow and nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, don't break anything. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh. I can't, uh, I can't bend my knee. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whoo! &gt;&gt; KIM: Even though we're here on a family vacation again, snowboarding is no different. I'm all by myself, and my sisters are off snowboarding together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Fun times. The one thing about Bruce is that he's such an incredible athlete that no matter what he tries, he picks up instantly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce and the instructors fall in love with each other. They hit it off. They're going on ski lifts together. They're hanging out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I thought, "Why not?" Invite all the guys over to the house, have a little pizza, a little beer. Sounds like a good "guy" night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just putting a little ice on my knee. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What happened? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nothing major. My knee's actually doing pretty good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You gotta take it easy. You can't be acting like that, like a kid out on those slopes, doll. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, my knee is This is just preventative stuff, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What'd you do to your, uh, hair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you like it slicked back like this, honey? Actually... Don't you think it's a good look? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you've lost your marbles. Bruce really seems to be, like, on a different planet for the last few days. I don't know what's going on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I invited over some guys I met on the slopes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You invited them over here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, for pizza, beer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who are you? Okay, honey, we'll get you some pizza and some beer, you know, and maybe a little more gel for your hair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Appreciate that. Love you. You're the best. Rock and roll, baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's a big-ass deer. Is that real? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's an elk. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what I want to I want to have a vacation like we used to have. No doo-dahs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at that, she's reading it. She's not listening to you, she's reading... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you're doing your Sidekicks and your e-mails. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm allowed to communicate with people. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go in the other room and communicate. Don't be in here. I'm getting really tired of everybody all day long sitting there going like this and nobody talking. It's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wouldn't talk if I had this or not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She walks in the house, she immediately goes to a computer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't think that's weird that she doesn't, like, enjoy this with us? &gt;&gt; KIM: Checking my e-mail... I didn't plan this vacation. I would rather not be here. I'm sick. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then go! &gt;&gt; KIM: I wouldn't have come if it was my option. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then go. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm already here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a little late now, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I wouldn't have come. I didn't want to come with a cold. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: I had to fly into town, I'm exhausted. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would really like to have this wonderful family vacay that I planned. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want Kim present in the moment with the family. Stop the texting. I was thinking maybe you would have, like, kind of a good time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I love it here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And take ourselves back to back in the day. Or we could just take these little things and maybe throw them away. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't do that, Mom. Don't do that. If you broke it, you're getting... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're so rude. I'm furious. I mean, I literally want to kill her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, come here, doll. Let me see it. I swear, I didn't mean to break &gt;&gt; KIM: No, where's your purse? You're going to see your phone down the toilet. &gt;&gt; KRIS &amp; BRUCE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KIM: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:: Kim's mature, Kim's mature... &gt;&gt; ALL: Kim's mature, Kim's mature, Kim's mature. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's see if yours works. It's what she deserves. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you don't want it done to yours, don't do it to mine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why don't you just go home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Perfect. I'd love to. Everyone's just rude. You're rude. Everyone just needs to leave me alone. The way you all treat me is rude I do nothing but nice things for everyone and you're sitting there laughing. It's not funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob, go get your sister right now. Bring her down here and tell her we need to have a little chatty-chat. &gt;&gt; ROB: The whole family is definitely bashing on Kim. And so, like, I go in there and I talk to her. Kim... It's not like we're kids. I'm 27 years old. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, will you go into Kimmie's room and tell her how much we love her? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just tell her to come here. Tell her I have a Cartier watch for her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And take her this and say, "Kimmie, I think you might have broken this." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Did she break it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kind of. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thanks, Rob. Oh, no, no, no, not that one. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's the long, rectan... the only rectangular one. &gt;&gt; ROB: This has your name on &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Khloe has a Cartier watch for you. So she wants you to come in there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie, that's not funny. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is not me. This is what Khloe and... I don't even know what Cartier means. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? Kim feels like everybody's ganging up on her. And to be honest... there are so many family members that you can feel that way really easily. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone's rude. You're rude. Everyone's rude. Everyone just needs to leave me alone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For what? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because of the way you all treat me. It's rude. I do nothing by nice things for everyone and if I want to be left alone, if I want... It's not funny! Get out if you're going to continue to laugh and make fun of me! I'm tired of it! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I start laughing at Kim when she's crying 'cause I just can't help it. She has this ugly crying face that she makes. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're sitting there laughing. It's not funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not laughing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Her feelings are hurt and she's upset. She's really crying. I feel bad. &gt;&gt; Hey. Hey. How are you? What's going on? &gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; Hey, look at those. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, come on in, guys. &gt;&gt; How you doing, man? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good to see you. All this tension in the air. Estrogen in the air. Cell phones flying. It's going to be great to have the guys come over and just have a good time. All right, let's get some pizza and let's do it. &gt;&gt; Bruce, we're going to kind of make ourselves at home if that's all right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My casa is su casa... something like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom. Come here for a second? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, yeah. Hi, honey. What's up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Who are all these guys? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're not like Bruce just invited... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Invites randoms over to the house for beer and pizza. Like, hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce is definitely going through menopause, and it's at the same time that my mom's going through menopause. So it's fabulous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've got basically three running events, plus the hurdles. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It takes Bruce a long time to warm up to somebody. So when he starts bonding with the 20-year-old ski instructors, I'm like, what's up with you, dude? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go into business, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom... is Bruce having a mid-life crisis? You need to go help him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Help him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This needs to stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What am I supposed to &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's Kim? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not sure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim's being sensitive right now because there's so many of us and she's alone. &gt;&gt; KIM: We just had a huge fight and the last thing I want to do is hang out with Bruce and his lame friends. My whole family seems to be more interested in hanging out with them than with me. I need some space. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can we talk, doing it somewhere where that Kim won't start crying? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, she cries a lot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: True, she is very emotional. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I feel bad. I don't want her to feel that way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel really bad. But what I really want, her not to do that anymore. Kourtney and I have agreed that we should just be nice to Kim. We feel bad. It has to be a lot for all of us to be ganging up on her. And we'll just call it a wash. Who cares? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you guys excited to go dog-sledding? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom tells us that she booked us to all go dog-sledding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's gonna be so much fun. And we get to go see the baby dogs, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Even though dog-sledding sounds amazing, I really just can't stand to be around my family right now. I just feel like I'm not feeling good, and shouldn't risk getting any sicker. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I guess she's just upset still. It just sucks 'cause she's gonna miss out on this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll miss you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Smell you later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Smell ya. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall, none of them are going home with us. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; REGGIE: What up? &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone's dog-sledding right now. I'm just, like, miserable. Like, lunch was miserable, everything is just, like, not fun. &gt;&gt; Yeah! Hit that brake a little. &gt;&gt; KIM: If I'm gonna be miserable here, I might as well be home and, like, be happy and having fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here we go! Around the corner! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hit the brake! Hit the brake! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think Kim is missing out on, like, this great family experience. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So much fun, so beautiful, but the one thing missing is Kim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just know I'm gonna remember this forever and it sucks that Kim can't share in these memories with us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Mr. GQ. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What made you want to do that to you hair? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It does make you look younger. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's trying to look like Scott. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do I need to look younger? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, you guys. Where's Kim? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Has anyone seen Kim in the last couple hours? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I haven't seen her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: After dog-sledding, you know, I mean, I haven't seen her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Sad night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Has somebody checked her room? Khloe, go check her room and see if she's in there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was there earlier and her door was shut. I'm looking for Kim. I notice her door's shut. I'm assuming she's taking a nap. Kim? Kimmy? Kim? Kim? Where the hell is she? I'm looking around. Her bags are gone and there's a note on the bed. Mom! Oh, my God! Kim wrote a note and said that she left. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She left? What do you mean she left? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a lot to feel attacked by people. I get it. I'm really worried. I'm really scared. Did I make her leave? Please call me back 'cause we're really worried. I just need to make sure you're okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean, she left? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She said, "I'm extremely tired of everyone "ganging up on me and treating me with such disrespect. "I've made the decision to go home. "Thanks for the wonderful family vacay." I'm really worried. I'm really scared, too. Did I make her leave? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Call her cell phone right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's so unsafe. We've never been here before, to Breckenridge. How does she know where to go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel really bad that she would feel this way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys should feel bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm really upset, and I think Kourtney and Khloe really realize that this time they've gone too far. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's been the Bentley argument, it was here. Kourtney and I just... You know, it was a lot to feel attacked by two people, I get And then it was my mom and Bruce yelling at her yesterday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It really makes us sad and realize that it's not right what we're doing, and we shouldn't all gang up on Kim. And we're just worried about her that she's okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kimmy, it's Khloe. I just went into your room and I got your note. I'm really sorry if, like, Kourtney and I... And we're really feeling bad about anything we did. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: And Mom and Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll apologize. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, please call me back 'cause we're really worried. I just need to make sure you're okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She left us. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, getting home isn't exactly as easy as I thought it would be. I need to go to the bus station, and then wait there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's Khloe. I just went into your room and I got your note. And I'm really worried about you. I'm really sorry if, like, Kourtney and I... And we're really worried. I just want to make sure you're okay. We love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, babe. So I think I'm gonna stay. As much drama's going on, it's not gonna get any better if I leave. It's only gonna get worse. It's, like, a family ski trip, and then I'm leaving, you know? It's not cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you guys want anything else to eat? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, where have you been? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kimmy! I felt so bad! I'm so sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited to see Kim when she walks through the door. What a relief. I'm glad you're back. &gt;&gt; KIM: I walk through the door and I definitely feel the love. Everyone's so excited to see me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think by her leaving, it really made me realize we should not just pick on each other for the dumbest things. I feel really bad, but I also think it was a really good learning experience for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to fight with you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're gonna stop Kourtney and I had a talk. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm glad you're home, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm glad to be back 'cause it is freezing out there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't know how to give someone the code, you just hit next. &gt;&gt; KIM: The fight is finally over. Thank goodness. Now we can have a great family vacation just like my mom planned. She won all these Grammies for the song "Don't Know Why." Rhymes with "Hora Moans." &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Norah Jones. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim and I, we love each other. We're gonna have our ups and downs. We're sisters. We're around each other way too much. You're gonna get under somebody's skin. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll do food. Kim, you'll probably get these all right. Kim, what do you always make for boys? &gt;&gt; KIM: Cupcakes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. What did you used to love? &gt;&gt; KIM: S'mores. Chocolate. Pop Tarts. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, guys, I'm going to bed. &gt;&gt; KIM: Me, too. That was fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was really fun. See how much more fun that was than the bus stop? &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I love you. Love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good night. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm... I gotta set this thing. 6:30? &gt;&gt; KRIS: At 6:30? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I'm going skiing with the guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, you got to really slow down. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Slow down? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, you don't want me to slow down. You don't want your husband to be slow. : Honey... Oh, man, that was lazy climbing over. I'm staying young and hip for you, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce has been trying so hard to make himself feel and look like he's 20 years younger. But you know what? I love Bruce just the way he is. Baby, I love you no matter how old you get. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm, thank you. I knew you would. I am getting a little older. But you know what? Even at my age, I got the hot wife, I got a great family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No alarms. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No alarm. Life is great. Let me get the light. : Honey, I'll get it. Oh. Good night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good night, Grandpa. &gt;&gt; KIM: Next time on<i>Keeping Up</i> <i>With The Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and I are going to listen to Bruce speak. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls, be on your best behavior. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need a drink. We gotta go home to our hotel room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls, that's not funny. &gt;&gt; Kimmy, right there. Put your leg back up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie's uncomfortable with the sexiness of the shoot. Are you upset about the photo shoot?
