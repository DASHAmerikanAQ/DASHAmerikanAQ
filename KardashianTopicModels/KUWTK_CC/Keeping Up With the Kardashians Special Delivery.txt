- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... So you're not happy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got two kids already. Three kids? Like, &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's really depressed and just saying he can't handle it. I could see him use this as an excuse to just... throw all responsibility away and be a wild animal. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just wanted to ask you a serious question. Now that you're a model, do you recognize any of these vaginas? Take a look. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're changing, you're in the back of the runway shows... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What looks familiar? You've never seen any of these vaginas anywhere? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I would not be able to recognize them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're telling me you forget a vagina? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's exactly what I'm saying. I doubt these are any, like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's... they're probably not supermodels. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So not one vagina? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nope, not one. She's got a nice body, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Which one? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This one's my favorite. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, her and her... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...are my main two bitches. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You think her boobs are fake? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, those are fake. I'm not mad at them. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hungry, fella? There you go. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! What is that? It's poo-poo, right? We're gonna give it to Daddy and say, "Daddy, you gotta change the baby." &gt;&gt; DOLL: Did I make a stinky? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She wants you to change the baby and give it to her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That thing's disgusting. &gt;&gt; DOLL: Pee-yew! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ew, what is wrong with this thing? Ew, it's-it's busting out of its seams! &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Change baby's diapey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-oh, look at Daddy. Let's go to the kitchen and watch Daddy do it. Ew! Poopy! &gt;&gt; DOLL: Did I make a stinky? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't understand why you guys are doing this to me. I've had enough training and enough kids... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you, though? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I did it with Mason. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe twice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Has Daddy ever changed your diaper? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No? Do you want him to? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, there's your doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Remember the first time we changed Mason's diaper together? 'Cause we both didn't know what we were doing... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I still don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Baby number three's coming and you're gonna have to figure it out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's just been really moody and I think that he is anxious and nervous about having a third baby. I truly hope that he really can get it together, because the baby is due at the end of the month and I really need his support. Look how cute this outfit is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! You did it! Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, what about it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good job, sister. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I said look how cute this outfit is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I see it; it's cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're exciting to show stuff to. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, stop! That's, like, so rude. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've seen 9,000 child's outfits. Like, I can't be excited about everything. I'm going to the other room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's Daddy going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hopefully to Japan. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why, what's happening in Japan? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nothing, he's just on my nerves lately. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone says they hate their significant other when they're pregs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. I keep telling myself that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everyone's saying I had plastic surgery and work done because I look good. &gt;&gt; SCHEPPY: When did you have time for that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe it's the new foundation. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: It's actually working. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The fountain of youth. That's what we could call it. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Oh, my God, I'm seeing dollar signs flying everywhere. &gt;&gt; SCHEPPY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wonder about the person eating alone, watching our every move. Do you know what I mean? Like, why is she sitting there for a-an hour by herself? &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Really? &gt;&gt; SCHEPPY: Yeah, weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The whole time that I've been sitting here, I feel like this person has been watching us. I know it sounds paranoid, but this past year, we've had some disturbing things happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this the stalker? This person keeps calling me. The stalker's never had my number. Should I answer? Hello? &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Hello, this is Ashley from, may I speak to Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Some, it's not from &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not, you should... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hung up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at this-- somebody from the airlines took a photo of me and North sleeping. Does anyone not think that's invasive? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like I can't even be out in public without feeling so anxious, and it's just not fair. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: What is her deal? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Too cute to be eating alone. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: I was thinking, I think, like, she's really hot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, it's, like, the pressure, like, this magazine party. I feel like everyone's expecting me to show up naked. I'm in Miami celebrating my magazine cover. There has been so much craziness, like, the launch of it. I did such a cool, artsy cover. This is like a dream come true. I did press in Australia, and they were like, "How can you... W magazine." When I was nude and painted silver. I'm somad right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't cry. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't feel comfortable with it! I feel like I didn't get it at the time. And now I look back and it's one of my favorite magazines that I've ever done, and that kind of helped me be comfortable with who I am. &gt;&gt; LARSA: As soon as the cover magazine, everybody was calling me. They're like, "Does her body really look like that?" I'm like, "Yes." You ask me what her body looks like? I'm, like, "Get the magazine, you'll see." &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like there was a lot of backlash, too. Some people are like, "Aren't you a mom?" And I'm like, "Yeah, it doesn't mean you shrivel up and die." &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Hey, Kim, right over here. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kim, right here in the... &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Ready, guys? Right here, everybody here. Right here. Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Honestly, this has been such a dream come true. &gt;&gt; HASTREITER: Everybody's like, "Who are you putting on next?" I said, "God." That's our next cover shot. &gt;&gt; MICKEY: We're retiring. We're closing down. &gt;&gt; HASTREITER: We got God. We got a photo shoot of God. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; VIRGIL: How are you? Good to see you, how are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: You too, what's going on? &gt;&gt; VIRGIL: Yes, we got a party! But, uh, I hear what, Kourtney's, like, giving birth, like, any moment. That's a... I had no clue. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; VIRGIL: Like, I saw the photos. &gt;&gt; KIM: So that's why I was rushing back, but then I'm gonna go to New York. &gt;&gt; VIRGIL: Hang out? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just to see Kanye for the day and go home tomorrow night and work a little bit. &gt;&gt; VIRGIL: How's Scott? I talked to him last time I was in L.A.. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's just, like, waiting for the baby. &gt;&gt; VIRGIL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think three is gonna be insane. &gt;&gt; VIRGIL: Yeah, I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, I had a realization today with Larsa-- she has four-- and I was like, "I don't think I could do more than two." &gt;&gt; VIRGIL: Two is, like, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it's gonna be two and done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I buy this for you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She doesn't like these things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you buy it for me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. Kourt, who are you gonna have, this time around, in the delivery room? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, these are cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you kind of dancing around the question I just asked you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're sort of avoiding me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not dancing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, why won't you just tell me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like last time, everyone literally made me almost have a full anxiety attack bothering me. You, Kim, Khloe, everybody killed me. Everyone's asking me about being in the delivery room and, honestly, I had too many people in the room last time and everyone really stressed me out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have a baby! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This time I wanted it to just be Scott and I in the delivery room, but right now, he's being the annoying, mean Scott, and I just have no tolerance for his mood. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So what are you trying to say-- you don't want us there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I haven't decided. I might just not call anybody and then call you guys after and go, "Hey, guys. Do you want to come meet your family member?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: We just want to be respectful of whatever you want, whatever makes you comfortable, so you let us know, little lady. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When you're ready to tell me if I'm in or if I'm out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom?! Mom?! Someone stole one of my birth control pills. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's been a few years since I've seen birth control. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I just touch it and maybe it'll rub off? Okay, so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, I need a... I need help. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You probably took this in your sleep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Kylie, my pill for the day is gone, and I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you had sex today? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you telling me that if you don't have sex, you can still get pregnant? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes, because sperm lives inside the vagina for three days. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who taught you this ? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, she went to school, and you should be happy your daughter has an education, especially sex ed. You obviously didn't. That's why you have multiple baby daddies and thousands of children. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Someone stole one of my birth control pills. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For real, and it wasn't me. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: You're not sleeping with anyone. You can miss a day. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Guys... I have some real drama. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But it's sister drama, so I don't know if I can... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. What, Kendall? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's about Kendall? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like we just need to do Operation Find Kendall a Boyfriend. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And, like, teach her how to do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I told her, I go, "I think you're gonna have a boyfriend soon, and you're just gonna..." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She needs to know how to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why... my... is my name always being... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you guys order pizza? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What is that? &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ordered maybe 20 pizzas? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This isn't funny. No, this isnuts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who do you really want in the delivery room? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't know. Can I rely on you? It's hurtful. I want to be able to depend on him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm leaving Friday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where you going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Vegas. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is there somebody in the backyard? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're paranoid! &gt;&gt; KRIS: My kids think I'm overreacting, but it's so creepy. Look, look, look! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This isnuts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, this isn't funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this a joke? &gt;&gt; KIM: What does it say? "Kylie, marry me?" &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think we should touch it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is really weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Will you marry me?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's 17. This is creepy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm calling the gate. Yeah, it's Kris Jenner. Somebody just delivered pizzas here. Who let this pizza company in the...? Don't eat the pizza. Do not eat one piece of that pizza. It could be poison. Thanks. Bye. They said they didn't let anybody in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Call... &gt;&gt; KIM: Call the pizza place, and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's time to call more than the pizza place. It's time to call the authorities or somebody. All these pizzas arrive. There's a marriage proposal to Kylie? This is my personal space. It's so creepy. &gt;&gt; KAT: Hi, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We just got pizza delivery, and this one has a note. &gt;&gt; KAT: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It says, "Kylie, will you marry me?" And some other pictures attached to it. I'm gonna photograph this. I think you need to check it out in the morning. I'm not gonna touch it anymore. &gt;&gt; KAT: Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I think you have to call security back. &gt;&gt; KAT: Absolutely. I completely agree. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, thanks, Kat. I appreciate it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did that jacket get ruined? &gt;&gt; KIM: A little bit. Still looks fine. It's just, like, really, really, rough. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, you guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The new and distressed Balmain. So, Kim, you know the Hairfinity people? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You and Khloe have Instamgrammed for them before, and so, they called and said, they were really interested in having you guys do a repost. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And, so, they talked about that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And they're opening a store with their products in London. And I said, "Why don't you have the girls do a personal appearance for you guys, because the girls have a real following in the UK." You know, you can help with the store opening, or just a... an announcement that it's coming? &gt;&gt; KIM: Got to be a kid's toy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nor's horse. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, we're good. So, um, what I suggested was, I really want to do this sooner than later. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. What are the dates? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's travelling on the eighth, the event will be on the tenth, and then you can get a flight right back to LA. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I'll be back the eleventh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just need to know, so I could book my other stuff. This month is turning into a crazy, hectic month. Besides this trip, I'm also supposed to go to Istanbul for a few days, for an appearance. I know Kourt is due any minute, but she doesn't care to have anybody in the delivery room, so, I really don't find a need to plan around her delivery date. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, so, you guys are in before I go any further? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm in! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. A quick trip to London town. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, well, I'm going to contract on this, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: What, did he used to do that, that...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...you guys better be sure, ladies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He used to make us do that. Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu. It's hard to do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so weird the things you remember as a kid. : And you have to talk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you find me a car yet? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. No one cares about you. You're a window shopper. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason's pretty pumped, though, about getting a bigger car. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, you're getting a new Escalade, Mase? &gt;&gt; MASON: No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't have a minivan, so... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my gosh. Why don't you get a tour bus with all these kids? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Mom! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is P gonna come to the hospital when you have this other kid? Will she come like Mason did? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She'll come after, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who do you really want in the delivery room? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No one's even asked, like, "Do you have any names? Do...?" No one's even tried to throw me a shower. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is the third time around. Every time, it gets less and less. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The fourth, people don't even, like, see the kid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I bet half the people aren't even in town. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I bet half the people don't care. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, maybe we just literally don't have anyone. I just don't know, can I rely on you to be there? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's always a possibility, messing with a person like me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is. Scott tends to joke around a lot, and he just acts like it's impossible that I would go into labor early. And it's really hurtful, because I want to be able to depend on him and that he's gonna be home and excited to be there. You know, every night when I wake up, I'm, like, "If this is it and I'm in labor, I am so tired that I couldn't even go to the hospital." I just can't deal. Like, half the nights when I wake up... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, that's how I feel. I'll probably be there, 50-50. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't take those chances. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. Ooh, somebody's eating... a little crazy. Where's this from? Nobody's gonna talk to me? Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Somebody's eating... Nobody's gonna talk to me? Somebody's eating... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where is that from, you guys? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I want to get a Vine going. Start a Vine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is there somebody in the backyard? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look, look, look! You guys don't see somebody in the backyard? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're paranoid! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Over by the flamingo. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We live in a gated community. We're completely safe. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There's no one in the backyard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we have a stalker, and you guys don't take this seriously. I know that my kids think I'm overreacting, but ever since the pizza incident, I've been really jumpy and on edge. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think that you have got something going on in your head. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do not have anything going on in my head right now. They could get to my kids. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is it part of the menopause? Is that something I should look forward to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I don't think this has anything to do with menopause. In my family... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But I want... I'm actually curious now. Are you in menopause? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't even know anymore. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's definitely passed it. Have you been in her bathroom and seen, like, period stains anywhere? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: In the past couple years? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Period stains? I didn't have period stains when I was 17. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, you didn't have your period when you were 17? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. What? You were a late bloomer? Is that what you're saying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm a very clean girl. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm. Did you have a little chuckle? &gt;&gt; KRIS: One day when I'm not here because the boogie man got me, you're gonna wish you would have paid attention. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, the boogie man! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, the boogie man! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Was this two rooms? This closet is so ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's huge. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doesn't this look like Vegas? This looks like a Las Vegas suite, like at the Wynn. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nothing. You look so cute. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, look at that trick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She always looks cute. What is all thisthat I keep? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love getting rid of It's literally my dream. This was dad's bolo tie. You got to keep that. Oh, I see something that's got to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't gone through it all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. I just... I see something. This. Via Sophia. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People actually liked it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you joking? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I kind of like it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have to go to Hidden Hills this week, I think Friday, 'cause Kris want me to run over there for 30 minutes, and look at the lights at this one house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm leaving Friday. Enjoy yourself. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Vegas. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-oh. No. You're, like, I haven't thought... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I am hosting a Lord-themed party. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Last night, Scott mentioned that he booked another Vegas appearance-- which is, like, the last thing he should be doing-- and it's really frustrating, because I was hoping that, you know, he would step up and really be here for me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But what about the line? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What is it for? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm being the Lord. I don't know. I'm royalty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It just doesn't seem like that's happening right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is going on here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I needed protection, and they're armed, and they're ready for anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're so dramatic. I promise you, you're just paranoid. You got to take a chill. &gt;&gt; PAUL: I think this is a pretty good-size baby. You're going to have the baby two weeks early. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nobody may be in town. Am I gonna end up in the delivery room alone? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so tired. My back is aching. &gt;&gt; KIM: You should stop by the chiropractor's office, and he'll just, like, give you a massage. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't do that pregnant. What if that puts her into labor? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just on your feet that puts you into labor. I don't... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you see that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, Khlo... stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was because you just did that, though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's a joke. Are you doing that on purpose? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's... How could I do that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like a legit alien. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you breathing, or is it moving like that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's moving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ugh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I am breathing, too, luckily. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. Well, thank God you're doing both. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, when are you going to Istanbul? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, the weekend of the 14th. I was gonna say, do you want to come to Turkey with me so we can go to Armenia? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I'm dying to go to Armenia. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, it's two hours away, so, why don't you just come with me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, that's nice. So, now, you want to take Kim with you, so, now, none of you guys can be here? What if I go into labor early? support. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All right, but didn't you, like, just say to us that you don't want anybody in your delivery room? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, it's just the point that you don't care to be here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do care to be here. I want to be in your delivery room. You literally said, "I don't want anybody in my delivery room." So, what do you want me to do? Like, stop everything? Like, no trains, planes, automobile? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop everything to have a... welcome your new family member? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't want me in there... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you're not gonna be there even, like, right after? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, you could be there during. Do you guys not watch movies where people are sitting in the waiting room waiting? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what it's for, and what if Scott happens to not be around? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would Scott not be around? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's the baby daddy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You never know. He's going to Vegas, like, next weekend. I'm just saying, it'd be nice to have people around and in town. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just mean on standby? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, if you could not go to Turkey, or wherever you're talking about at the same time, that would be great. When Scott was being supportive, I wasn't concerned about my sisters travelling, but now, I just feel like I have nobody here to support me except for my mom. You guys are giving me anxiety. Can you just go so I can relax and be alone for a minute? It seems like nobody even cares. What if my mom can't be there? Am I gonna end up in the delivery room alone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God, she's so dramatic today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, why is the guy out there? He has, like, a pistol on his hip. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have no idea what's going on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I'm trying to copy you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are there, um, people that are strapped here? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why is there a security guard right outside this door? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But why do they have guns on them? Like, what's happening? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you been paying attention to what's been going on here for, like, the longest time? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, seriously, you got to take a chill. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't take a chill. I'm actually on edge at all times, and I, like, have anxiety attacks all day long. So, everybody that works here now has a gun, and they're armed, and they're ready for anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're a little extreme, though, right? Like, to have two-- one in the back, one in the front? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I needed protection. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so typical of my mom, just to, like... Someone sent a box of hair, and they were nice enough to send it with 40 pizzas, okay? So, just take the gift and say "thank you," and send back the hair. You don't need to get two armed security men strolling the perimeter of your whole property. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They got me some new bullets for my gun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a gun... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Since when have you had a gun? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...as you know. The one Bruce bought me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think you would know what to do with a gun. Do you even know how to load bullets? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a gun license. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That doesn't mean you know what you're doing. No, you're not having a gun, so you could accidentally shoot somebody. You're so dramatic. I promise you, you're just paranoid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need to take care of myself, so I feel safe, and once I feel comfortable again, maybe I'll make some more adjustments, but for right now, this is the only way I can sleep. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Are you getting anxious to have this baby? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm, like, ready and not ready at the same time, but I guess that's how it goes. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Pretty soon. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am at the doctor's to check on how the baby's doing and to see when the doctor thinks he's coming. Since nobody was around to come with me, I'm bringing my friend Nicole. He is non-stop, like, moving around. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Yeah, I think this is a pretty good-size baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; PAUL: All right, let's have a look. So, the head... head's down... facing the right direction, I'd say. &gt;&gt; NICOLE: Oh, that's so cool. &gt;&gt; PAUL: The baby's kicking around like crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Amazing, huh? &gt;&gt; NICOLE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He, like, doesn't stop moving. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Here's the heart. &gt;&gt; NICOLE: Wow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you going out of town anywhere? &gt;&gt; PAUL: No, I'll be right... I'll be here now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank God. &gt;&gt; PAUL: I'll let you get dressed, I'll-I'll meet you in my office, and we'll get you out of here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; PAUL: So, you're not dilated, but the head is really low. It's down on the cervix really tight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; PAUL: So, I'm gonna predict that you're gonna have the baby about... ten days to two weeks early. That's just my basic prediction. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The baby is going to be coming early, which I am excited for, but now it seems like exactly what I thought would happen is going to happen-- that nobody may be in town when it's time for the baby to come. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like we're being followed. I don't know what's going on, but it's freaking me out. I don't even know what to do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And you wonder why nobody wants to be in the delivery room with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you're coming from Vegas, I don't want you there. I don't want him drunk in the delivery room. I can't deal with the stress. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, at Costco, I need to get the toothbrushes and the, um... chocolate-covered raisins... &gt;&gt; KAT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...that we got... we, um, always buy for the container on the bar. &gt;&gt; KAT: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like we're being followed. This guy's acting super strange. &gt;&gt; KAT: You mean in the SUV? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, that SUV, and I can't tell who's inside the car. Like, is it a girl or a guy? &gt;&gt; KAT: I can't see that far. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I usually have really good intuition, and I know that whoever's following me-- it's not paparazzi. Paparazzi doesn't hide. It's so creepy. I really don't know what's going on, but it's freaking me out. That guy got off on our same exit. &gt;&gt; KAT: Seriously? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I don't even know what to do. I feel like I cannot get out of the car, for sure. What if I just park right in front of the store...? &gt;&gt; KAT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...so it's public, and you run in and just get our stuff really fast? &gt;&gt; KAT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. Is that them? Oh, &gt;&gt; KAT: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's get the hell out of here. There was a guy over there taking pictures. He was popping up from that bush over there. &gt;&gt; KAT: Seriously? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. All of these unnerving situations have been piling on, and I feel just ready to explode. &gt;&gt; KAT: You should have someone with you when you go out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, more security. I don't know how much more security I can get. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing in here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just trying to organize. Everything is such a mess. I can barely even bend over. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I don't why you're even trying to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I mean, who else is gonna do it? Certainly not you. Oh, the doctor said, the baby's coming early. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But everyone has plans, so, I'll just be in the delivery room alone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, that does happen. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think so. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bet R2-D2 would be there for you. Maybe he'll be in the delivery room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He would be there for me. It's the only person. Don't know if I could have even rely on you to be there. Every sing... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, if I wasn't there the first two times. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, if you're going out of town... You have Vegas planned. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This week. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And who knows what's next week? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Me going to Vegas for a night, I don't know how that affects you. First of all, I'm 40 minutes away with a plane on standby, that I can get on at any time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's perfect. Why don't you go for a while, and then just make sure someone's here on standby? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: See, you say things like that, that don't make any sense, and you wonder why nobody wants to be in the delivery room with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you're coming from Vegas, I don't want you there. If I did go into labor while Scott is in Las Vegas, there's not even a one percent chance that I would tell him, because I don't want him drunk in the delivery room. So, I just need to wrap my head around the idea that I might be doing it without him. I'll just figure it out. I can't deal with the stress. &gt;&gt; MAN: Do you like to party? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, Kourtney's a little upset, but I also have to make money. : Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have an emergency situation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kat called and said that we have legitimate threats and photos being leaked, unless I give him money. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Tonight, I'm set to do an appearance in Vegas, and Kourtney's a little upset, but I also have to make money. She needs to leave it alone. Hey, man. &gt;&gt; MAN: Good to have you back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, thanks, man. Hey, my pastor. &gt;&gt; RICH: Dude, hi. Love you, man. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, buddy. &gt;&gt; RICH: Good to see you, man. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; RICH: Are you ready for this, like, kid and stuff? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I never am. I mean, I'll... listen... &gt;&gt; RICH: Are you feeling more stressed than in the summer, or you feel better? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, you know, lately, she's been really, like, "You're not excited for the new baby, and you're not excited..." &gt;&gt; RICH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: "...for the new outfit that I found for the baby." And I'm, like, "Listen, honey, it's the third time around. How manytoddler outfits can I look at?" It's ridiculous! &gt;&gt; RICH: Yeah, tell me about it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Leave me alone! &gt;&gt; RICH: I hear you. Are you gonna go hard tonight, or no? Don't do it. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, don't go hard... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. Dude, you don't want anything to do with me tonight. Can we get a... can we get a water for my pastor? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Certainly. &gt;&gt; RICH: Waters all around. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Water for pastor. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll take a vodka and Red Bull. &gt;&gt; RICH: Water. &gt;&gt; WAITER: And a vodka, Red Bull? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm nopastor. &gt;&gt; MAN: Must be your home away from home. I feel like you're here all the time now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Me, too. &gt;&gt; MAN: Not a bad place to be, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Never. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh! &gt;&gt; MAN: Tonight you got to make some room. You like to party?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, Scott is on the loose, and he's texting me now. "What theis Rob's number? I just called his old number, and it was really weird. I just gotup thinking I haven't hugged him in a long time." What? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? Who said that? Rob or Scott? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott. I'm calling him. Like, you can't come to my house at6:00 a.m. So, Scott, apparently, flew home from Vegas on a private plane, drunk, texting me the most insane texts that he needs to go to my house to give Rob a hug. I don't know what's going on, but I do know that he is out of his mind. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you got to go to sleep. You're not going to my house at this hour. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just felt like I wanted to go hug my brother. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure he's asleep. Why don't you wait till tomorrow, and hug him in the daytime? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, but if he's still up, too, like, I want to give him a hug. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you got to go to bed. Kourtney's gonna kill me and you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can I go over there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott is just... I know this way too well. I've been down this road hundreds of times. Okay, well, you try to get some rest, Lord. I don't know why he's being so selfish right now. Kourt's gonna be pissed, and the fact that she's so far along and pregnant-- it's just not okay to do to someone. &gt;&gt; KAT: I don't want you to freak out, but they hacked your iCloud from your closet camera. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel so violated. What was on the tape? &gt;&gt; KAT: They said you were naked. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh,! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. Love you two. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Um, if you were to swap hairstyles with any of the other Kardashian members, who would it be and why? &gt;&gt; KIM: I would say Kylie, 'cause she's really fun... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aah, you took my answer! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, I'm obsessed with my sister's hair. I love that she's so funky and mixes it up, and... &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, then, wait. I'll switch my answer if you want Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, okay, well, I want Kylie. &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, Khloe really does have the best hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, thank you! Stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe's hair is insane. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I absolutely love being in London with all of these amazing people. Right now, though, I'm thinking about Kourtney, thinking about how out of it Scott was. Should I be telling Kourtney that Scott was drunk? But at the moment, I got to get it together and put a smile on my face and enjoy this event. What up, London?! We just want to say thank you to Brock Beauty and to Hairfinity. Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you guys so much for coming out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good night. Good night. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Hair on point, makeup flawless, outfit on fleek." &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Fleek! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can anyone explain to me what "on fleek" really means? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Fleek" means "on point," basically. &gt;&gt; MAN: Is it a real word? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: "Outfit on fleek." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, there was a... It was a YouTube... It was a... it was a YouTube video, and the girl was, like, "Eyebrows on." "Fleek." Like, crazy. &gt;&gt; MAN: Like, wow. Like, is this a new thing, or just started it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And they got every... It got everywhere. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Is fleek the new keeps? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Eyebrows on fleek. Love you guys. I would love to eat something. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KIM: Should we sit side by side? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Should I call Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. So, Scott-- he was very wild last night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He called me at, like, 5:30. He kept begging, "I want to give Rob a hug, I miss him, I feel like I don't see him." I said, "Wait till tomorrow and see him in the daytime, like a normal person. I told him, no, Rob was sleeping. Rob locked the whole house, he was banging on the doors. Robert called me and was like, "He sounds crazy, I don't want to let him in." I said, "Okay, that's your choice, you're allowed to do that." Somehow he got in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's ridiculous. This is what happened last time and I'm fine, I just don't know what to do in the future, to, like... It's like I stuck this boundary and he just can't come here in this state. Um... All right, so I'm gonna go get ready. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think she just doesn't know what to do. I mean, what would you do if you were, like, had three kids with someone that was, like, an alcoholic? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm usually, like, team Scott and I'm like, "Oh, she's so hard on him." And now I'm just like, "Ugh, I'm so over it, Scott." But I truly feel bad for her. I think Khloe and I realize that we need to put the rest of our trip on hold. We need to be there for Kourtney, and just help out in any way that we can, 'cause who knows if Scott will be there? He needs to, like, get his life together. It's, like, not cute anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KAT: Kris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KAT: Hi, it's Kat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kat, what's going on? &gt;&gt; KAT: So I just got word from our P.I. and I don't want you to freak out, but whoever it is might have gotten a video of you from your closet camera. They said you were naked. &gt;&gt; KRIS: &gt;&gt; KAT: When they hacked your iCloud I think they were still able to access that camera that's in your closet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did they say what was on the tape? &gt;&gt; KAT: Just you changing in your closet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KAT: They told us that they're asking for money in return for the video that they have. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And they're gonna release this footage? Can they do... Like, that's extortion. I can't believe that there are people that would do something like this. I just want to cry right now. It's so sick and twisted and I feel so violated. So they're gonna blackmail me... &gt;&gt; KAT: Unless we figure out how to stop them... Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What the? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Over there. Look. Every day they need to come out here-- look how fat she's getting 'cause no one plays with her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She gets tons of exercise. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How Mom ended up with the dog, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So we have an emergency situation that I wanted to talk to you guys about. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kat called and said that we have legitimate photos being leaked and threats of footage that was taken off of the cloud of me naked, in my closet, changing my clothes. And they're telling me that they're going to expose me and put it on the Internet unless I give 'em money. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would that be on the cloud-- the camera system? Is that typical? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because it... Because it's how I check it from my device. So I just want you to make sure everything that you have is shut down. This is a good lesson for all of us, at my naked expense. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do feel bad. My mom had such high fears that people are watching her, and now her biggest fears are coming true. It's prettyup, and this is a huge issue that we have to fix. No, I am sorry for not taking you so seriously, I feel like... I mean, I do think sometimes you can get a little extreme, but I understand, like, how scary that is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Am I dramatic? Sure, but when things are serious, that's when I try to give you guys a real heads-up, and that's why I want you to come over here so we can talk in person and figure it out. I think my kids are starting to appreciate how serious this situation is now, and we all need to take our level of security and everything else around us to a whole new level. So that's the plan. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shh. Who was that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's the neighbor kids over there, they have kids swimming there all summer long. I don't think that little dog can swim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here, come here. Come here. If you could just grab him, that would be nice, too, Mom. Hey. Hey. Just come here. Littlestain. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's like a race dog. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: With everything that's going on, Kim and I decided to clear our schedules, cancel some other work trips that we had and throw Kourtney an awesome baby shower. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. It is so cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. You're not on lockdown, you don't have to stay at the house. What do you feel bad about? Why don't you take a nap? 'Cause you slept for 30 minutes. And then we will talk about it, but I'm on my cell phone. So Scott just, like, fell off the wagon and has also been really depressed. And when Scott is like this, he's not allowed at his house. So he is at my house. I know how to deal with Scott really well, so I don't mind talking to him and just kind of, I guess, babying him. Okay, go to sleep. Bye. But I feel horrible for Kourtney. We want to be by her side, and at least we're there to support her in any way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe and I just want to welcome you guys all to Kourtney's baby shower. I really wanted to have breakfast at Tiffany's. really wanted to, but you could say you... It's okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: And, um, it's Kourt's favorite movie and we thought it was perfect, so we kind of made our own Tiffany's. But, um, we're so excited to meet your new little baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: And that's it. Welcome, everyone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay. &gt;&gt; ALL: Yay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is so amazing. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You pulled it off. I am excited that my sisters are throwing me this baby shower and I'm happy that I have all these amazing friends in my life. Nicole, um, is gonna come with me to Malibu. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So we'll just go from here. But, at this point, I feel like all I can do is rely on myself. I'm saying how Scott went to your house in the middle of the night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob was like, "Someone's in the house, banging on the door." He was being a &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know what Scott's doing and I really cannot depend on him right now. &gt;&gt; MAN: Let's do it! Keeping Up with the Kardashians: How's life as a five-person household? Kourtney gave birth to baby Reign. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No difference. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Scott, no, no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, I'm gonna go home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nope. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, you're not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: She doesn't want you to come home, you're not... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She doesn't want me to come home? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, wait, wait. He's gone again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kourt, like, kick him out of the house or what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott is MIA, no one knows where he is. Kourtney never knew he left. He left without telling her.
