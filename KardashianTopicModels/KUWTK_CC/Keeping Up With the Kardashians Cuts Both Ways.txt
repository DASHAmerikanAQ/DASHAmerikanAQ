- &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? Do I have camel toe? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, you freak. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What'd you say? &gt;&gt; KIM: Nothing, I said, "Can I have the other half of your turkey sandwich?" You freak. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Turkey, camel. Same thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! Kourtney's in labor! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! Swear to God? No! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no! Ooh! Is Scott in town? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You little piece of ! My heart... I-- I... This family's soup. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That was really good, Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was good. 16 00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,014 You got me. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna go check on my little toilet up in here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want to check out the can? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Road trip. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Is it a good time? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, bathtub. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am coming towards the end of my pregnancy, so I want to finish up everything that's going on with housework. All the remodeling, I just want everything done before this baby comes. I've been waiting for this moment. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That toilet seat warms? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: It does warm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what Lamar's dream is. &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: When you get up, it'll flush automatically and close. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, it does? &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am very excited. Thank you. Now that we're getting the house all ready, how many children do you think we could fit in this house? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We could... In the playroom, I could build bunk beds, but there's four. How much fun would that be? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's six kids. I don't want to be outnumbered by my children. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am so excited to be giving Mason a sibling. I don't know what I would do without my sisters and my brother, and Scott doesn't have any siblings, so he definitely does not understand where I'm coming from. So you only want two children? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, how many do you want? I didn't know you wanted more-- &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I'm saying! Every day it gets to be more. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I need to see what it's like when I have two, but that's what life is about. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't you think I should have some kind of say in this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, how do you prevent having a baby? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Birth control. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but after this... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I'm not going on the pill. I don't believe in it anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! So can Scott wear a condom, or you don't believe in that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sure, whatever he wants. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney was telling Scott that she wants more kids. I saw Scott's reaction. I know he's freaked out. Kourtney won't go on birth control, he doesn't want to wear a condom. They have been together for like seven years. They have two kids. I get it. For people that go to therapy together, they're really not good at this stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's no way to have sex with you ever again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She doesn't care anyway. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, she doesn't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She said having sex after a baby is like sticking a metal pipe up your &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Especially with Lamar. I wouldn't even want to know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you know how big his "sauseege" is? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I'm just assuming. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are you guys off to? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: A friend's house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait a second. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: First of all, Kylie, those are my sunglasses. And, Kendall, those are my boots. That's not a boutique up there. You can't just like walk in my closet and pick out anything you want to wear without asking. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, but I think, um, some of your stuff looks kind of better on the younger generation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's called stealing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, it's not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When you go into somebody's closet... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: When it's your mother and it's in your house, how is that stealing when you're borrowing it for a day? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I never see the things that you guys "borrow" ever again. One of the most frustrating things is the fact that Kendall and Kylie Jenner feel like my closet is their closet. &gt;&gt; FRIEND: I'd steal this one. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, I'm not stealing. I'm just going to... Oh, they're transition. &gt;&gt; FRIEND: This is cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You borrow my clothes and lose them or give them away and you lie about it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: How come every single pair of my shoes is in your closet? You're being mean to me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What do you want from me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every time they take something, their one excuse is always it's not age appropriate. When you have really great pieces, they'll always be age appropriate. So, girls, follow my rules and have a little respect for what's mine. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You are 60 years old and you have Jordans, so I stole them. Those I stole, I will say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not 60. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How old are you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How old are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 56. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm gonna tweet "my mom is 56." &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't tweet out your mom's age. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Anyone could go on the internet and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't tweet nasty things about your mom. I've got to go to my doctor's appointment, and you guys are making me late. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What doctor's appointment are you going to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm getting my boobs redone, so it's my consultation. I'll see you guys later, okay? I love you, and I got to go. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. Hello. &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm Kris Jenner to see Dr. Glassman. &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: I'll take you right in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, awesome. Ooh, those are like snow cones. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Yeah, those are... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, those are crazy. And this is... Whoa, honey. I have enough boobs here for like a football team. These are good. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Yeah, those are nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been wanting to do this for so long, but I can't believe that I am sitting here going through porn magazines so I can find the perfect pair of knockers. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: Nice to see you. Good to see you, and you smell great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do I? It's Kim Kardashian. I have been looking at boobs for weeks. You did my boobs in 1989. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: 1989. Yeah, I think that's right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's 23 years ago. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's crazy. However, I'm a "D." &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: That's too big. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like it's just... way too much and it looks matronly. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Many, many years ago, he did my boobs for the first time, and it's been like 23 years that I've had these implants in, and I think they have a shelf life of like ten. And who's kidding who? The times are changing, and my boobs have to keep up. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: Okay, great. That's perfect. Despite the fact that they're too large now and a little low, you would never know that you have breast implants. And so we're gonna lift your breasts, take out the implants, put new ones in, size to be determined. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sweating, I'm so nervous. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: Um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you think you can make this situation look better? &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: Definitely. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: So here's... here's the sequence of events... Playboy. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: That's pretty good, too. So we have lots of choices. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited I'm doing this. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: Yeah, I think it's gonna make you look thinner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do, too. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: And I think it's gonna make you more comfortable, not only in choosing the right clothing but also in your personal life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Yeah. Thursday. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: Good seeing you. I'll see you on Thursday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good to see you, too. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: Give my best to 161 00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:54,714 to Bruce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I will. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow, are you going gardening? Whoa. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mase. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's everyone doing this weekend? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Leaving me. Going to Vegas. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why is Scott going to Vegas right now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For his birthday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, why don't you come and stay at my house with Lammy and I? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's easier here to just stay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mase. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to sleep at KoKo's house with Mom? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoa, what are you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where'd you get those swim shorts? They're a little crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're gonna go swimming with Dad? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, we're gonna go swim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you gonna get tan before you go to Vegas? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Damn right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But he doesn't turn over. The backside of his body is albino and his front is like leather. Oh, God. I don't know how you do it, sister. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't either sometimes. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks, Sam. Bye. Well, here we go again. I have nerves because it's the morning of my surgery. &gt;&gt; FRIEND 1: Hi! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! Your little faces are exactly what I needed to see. It's amazing that my friends, Joyce and Sheila and Shelley, they're with me. I feel blessed. I already have a pair on, but I have to show you what these panties look like because we need to redesign. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: You object to those? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe a G-string in pink. &gt;&gt; FRIEND 2: Excuse me, in the old days, they were paper. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: They were. Sit here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good, yeah. &gt;&gt; FRIEND 1: How are your nerves right now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um... &gt;&gt; SURGEON: You know, everybody's always afraid of one of two things-- they're either afraid of being awake during surgery or they're afraid of not waking up at the end. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. My heart's beating really fast and I feel like I'm sweating and nervous and anxious. Hi, Kim. I'm here with Auntie Shelley, Auntie Sheila, and Auntie Joyce. I'm a little nervous, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: You did your face and you were fine. This is like nothing. I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'm gonna go. Okay. No, I'm just sweating. I can smell myself. I'm nervous. I'm going into a nervous sweat. &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: No, you're doing... you're doing great. 216 00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:25,565 That's okay, everyone is nervous. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's already talking about having more kids already. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: I don't know about more than two. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I'm too young to have 15 kids running around. That's why, you know, I may have to snip 'em. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you gone to like a real fertility specialist? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It gives me major anxiety. 225 00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:47,186 &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you need to go through it. Can't run from your problems. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; DR. GLASSMAN: We're gonna take good care of you. I know you're nervous. &gt;&gt; SURGEON: Take a couple big big breaths. I want you to have plenty of good oxygen in your lungs when you go to sleep. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; JOE: What's the plan tonight? Like what's the plan for your birthday? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We'll go to dinner at 9:45 and then we'll go to 1 Oak at like midnight? &gt;&gt; JOE: Oh, cool. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I have one last trip before the new child comes, and luckily I'm gonna celebrate my birthday at 1 Oak in Vegas. You want to see the girls' store real quick? &gt;&gt; JOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There it is, the motherland. Hi, guys. Thank you. &gt;&gt; JOE: Does he get a discount? Do we get 20% off? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want me to take a picture of you with all the girls in the bathing suits? &gt;&gt; JOE: Yeah, let's do it. That'll be funny. Let's do you and me, though. Isn't Khloe the tall one though? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They should raise her up. That's probably true. That's good. &gt;&gt; JOE: That's perfect, right? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's about right. I'm excited. I know it's gonna be a good time and I know this is gonna be 250 00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:09,168 my last hurrah, so I better enjoy it. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; SURGEON: That's what came out and that's what went in. I'm pleased and I think you'll 254 00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,459 be pleased. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. &gt;&gt; SURGEON: Okay? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Straighten my bangs 'cause they're a little cray-cray. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: When does Mom get out of her surgery? Do you know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have no clue. You can call her. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How was your surgery? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just a little kind of, you know, out of it right now. I've lost track of time, but I feel good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You are so weird. Kylie, come say hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, baby. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We miss you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... my little bunny. I miss you too, angel pie. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're so sweet to call. You're such good little girls. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, are you on some kind of medication? 'Cause you sound kind of funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not that bad and I feel really good right now, so... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait, um, since you're there, can I borrow that like green-striped top of yours? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It definitely seems like the painkillers kicked in. And I'm actually starting to think that my mom should get more surgery because now she's telling us that we can have anything in her closet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, How you doing, buddy? &gt;&gt; JOE: So when's Kourtney due? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: First week of July. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Thirty days you'll have two. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's already talking about having more kids already. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: I don't know about more... more than two. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I'm too young to have 15 kids running around. That's why, you know, I may have to snip 'em. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: She might cut it off, though, if you get a vasectomy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not gonna tell her. I'll just make pretend I'm shooting blanks. I could tell Kourtney I'm done having kids, but she'd be like, "Well then, I'm not sure I could be with somebody that's not gonna have more than two." I got to take things into my own hands. No pun intended. And I got to snip-snip where it needs to be snipped. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: You really thinking about going to get that? &gt;&gt; JOE: Can't you just talk her out of it? Kourtney can sometimes occasionally be reasonable. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not, not in this case. The only route is snipping the old sack up. &gt;&gt; JOE: Kourtney's probably saved up your sperm in a damn bank. Like you're not getting out of this. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: She has that on ice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Definitely got my on ice. &gt;&gt; JOE: Yeah, you're screwed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know, but this whole thing is making me anxious. &gt;&gt; JOE: All right... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, we got to get ready. 311 00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:18,858 &gt;&gt; JOE: For this event. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: You say that... &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; DEEJAY: Happy birthday to Scott Disick in the building! We love you! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, let's see some Kim and I decided we were gonna go see Kris's new knockers first. If I wheeled you into your mother, it'd be like, "I'm here to see you." It's classic! We just want to be nice and make sure that her surgery went well and show some support, which is weird 'cause she probably has to go bra shopping for her support now. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's not a baby. Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's been texting too much, so I had to put her in the wheelchair, so she doesn't hurt anybody. &gt;&gt; KIM: How do you feel? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel great. That is so funny. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you having, a little rack of lamb? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SCOTT: When I got my first penis reduction, I was in the room across the way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Penis reduction? In your dreams. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You need to tighten your hands up to look young. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your hands are starting to sag. &gt;&gt; KIM: I told her that... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, it was ridiculous. One night she comes up to me, she goes, "Think I should pull this right here?" &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think you could. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was like, "What are you talking about?" She, "Look at my hand. If I just yanked right there, look ten years younger on my my hand." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim pretended like Kourtney was in labor. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's not nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Didn't even think about how early she was or late she was. How funny. How excited are you to have a little girl? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm excited. I mean, I'm nervous, too, just because I don't know, you know, how different it is to have a girl vs. having a boy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really different. I'm glad I got to have both. I'm glad you guys get to have both. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Me, too. I mean, at least now we can... If we don't have any more, we have the combo. A boy and a girl and, you know, what else can you ask for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A combo. This is not a drive-thru fast food restaurant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, it's not a drive- 355 00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,492 thru at all, but I got the combo. No biscuit. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: These are cute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hmm. &gt;&gt; Oh, my God, she's blind! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Like look! Do you think a 56-year-old would wear these? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Or these. That's why I'm taking them. Seventeen magazine's West Coast contributors. We have to have a good sense of style, and so we're so lucky to have a mom like mine because she has good stuff. This is such a cute outfit. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I kind of want this. I'm not gonna lie. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm gonna take this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing?! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God! Nothing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing in Mom's closet? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She told us we could come in here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She said it was okay? That's not like her. I just don't know if this is a good idea. But I do like the jacket. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You scared me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Looks good on you. Yeah. 375 00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:36,422 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks. Ow, ow, ow. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Any requests for dinner tonight? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you cooking? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I might, but I don't know if you're gonna like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are the options? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This sounds good-- "milk or almond milk, dates, honey, banana, raw cocoa." What about ginger-and-carrot soup? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not gonna eat a ginger-carrot soup for dinner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't eat. You're man-orexic, so what's the difference between soup or nothing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you're right. I don't even know if I'm gonna be home for dinner 'cause I'm gonna be out for a little bit 'cause I got to go all the way to town to go to the doctor. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're doing something responsible... on your own without anyone telling you to do it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I'm just going to get a physical, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, that's something a responsible man would do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A responsible man wouldn't listen to this kind of &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Carrot soup for dinner and hot cereal? No, thanks. 400 00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:39,485 I'll be at the doctor's if you need me. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just here to see Dr. Vaisman, when you get a chance. I've decided I want to, at least, go into the doctor's office and find out a little bit more about what a vasectomy really is, and if you can get it reversed, I mean... it's always scary when a doctor's playing under your &gt;&gt; DR. VAISMAN: What's going on? What brings you in today? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I figured you could either put me in the right direction, or just give me a little bit of knowledge about it? &gt;&gt; DR. VAISMAN: What is it that you want? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm thinking... I need to possibly get a vasectomy... &gt;&gt; DR. VAISMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Because I can't keep popping these kids out every other week. &gt;&gt; DR. VAISMAN: Okay. The procedure to do a vasectomy is they basically make some... couple of small incisions, and they clip the tube-- the vas deferens-- on both sides. Sometimes they tie it off, sometimes they fry the edges. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where is that located, like under your? &gt;&gt; DR. VAISMAN: Yeah, basically, these incisions are usually made in the scrotum. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do they have to shave around all over to like make sure... depending on... &gt;&gt; DR. VAISMAN: Yeah, it's possible that they're going to have to do some shaving. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'd rather not tell Kourtney I do it, but if I come home with a freshly shaved scrotum, she's gonna be imagining that I'm in the streets trying to pick up young chicks that I need to shave my scrotum for. &gt;&gt; DR. VAISMAN: Yeah, I mean, you're gonna have some restrictions when you're... when you come back, so for about a week or so, there's no sex. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's not a problem. You know, there's always that chance that Kourtney could try to seduce me at some point... and this could happen all over again. I mean, she's very, very sneaky. She could catch me somewhere, vulnerable, and somehow get pregnant again. I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; DR. VAISMAN: The negatives are that it's... it's a permanent sort of solution. You have to be prepared when you do these things... for this to be it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please look at my &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, stop, seriously. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just look at 'em once. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're still under construction. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been married for almost three years. It's difficult with us. If something is wrong, I would rather like digest it and then explain it to Lamar. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're going to get checked to get a vasectomy without even running it past me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whatever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you don't think 449 00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,686 that you need to tell me that kind of stuff, then there's a problem. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Dickie Boy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Bobby. Speaking of Dickie Boy, I went to thedoctor. &gt;&gt; ROB: Thedoctor? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't say anything to anybody, but I'm honestly thinking about getting a vasectomy, so I can't have any more kids, but it's kinda scary, even though I want to do it. I kind of wanted an opinion on the whole vasectomy thing, and I wanted to speak to somebody who was like family. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why in the world would you do that? Like that is the craziest thing I've ever heard in my life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, but you don't understand. I already have two kids. Kourtney says she doesn't want to ever get on birth control, so the only way I can stop having kids is if I get a vasectomy. &gt;&gt; ROB: Does Kourtney even know? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, talk to her about it 'cause Kourtney will like cut youroff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I'm trying to do! I agree with Rob in the sense that Kourtney probably would try to cut myoff, but in this sense, ironically, I'm kinda doing that before she could. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're in your 20s, bro. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know. &gt;&gt; ROB: I wouldn't do it. I would think about it. I gotta go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, next time you hear from me, I'll be shooting blanks. Thanks for the advice. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's a good surprise. &gt;&gt; SCOTT:Bobby. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, hi, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! What's up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So... why did you call us here today? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me show you something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Show us what, you weirdo? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm back from my surgery and it feels so good to be home, and I invited everybody over to show them my new boobs. Anybody want to have a look? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is just weird. Oh, geez, this is like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where's Joe Francis when you need him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What theare you on, dude? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Everything! &gt;&gt; KRIS: A lot of drugs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is like really awkward. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's a lot of stitches going on here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are we looking at anything that's not healed yet, people? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, you're trying to see my mom's boobs? Go inside. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me see those things. All right, I'll get out of... Congratulations on your new breasts. Lovely set of hooters you got there. That's just weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, this is such a weird family. Ew! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I don't really want to see that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, stop, seriously. You're sick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just look at 'em. Give me a little look. A little... just look at 'em once. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, when they're out of surgery. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're out of surgery. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, they're not. They're still under construction. I mean, the stitches are still-- it's like Frankenstein boobs. This is so sick. It's disgusting. You can't force me to look at your-- I actually think this is like molestation or something. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like... &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please look at my &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You gotta calm down. &gt;&gt; ROB: The surgery is making you snort. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's a freak. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh, it's so different. I love the carpet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You do? &gt;&gt; KIM: And the walls. I love the walls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this gonna be in the middle? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's really cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then I'm hanging this huge turquoise chandelier that's in the garage, but they're hanging it tomorrow. This probably won't stay, but I was gonna put like cute little Q-tips in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seeing Kourtney prepare for her baby girl, I mean, it does make me think like, okay... now I'm 31, I'll be 32 this year, and as young as I feel, I still have those feelings where I'm like one day I can't wait for the day that I have my own kids. It'll be exciting when that happens. Aw, are you a little Mickey Mouse? &gt;&gt; MASON: Surprise. &gt;&gt; KIM: You want to go in there and pretend like you're your sister-- here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look it, Kourt, I found this little baby. Look. &gt;&gt; MASON: No, I'm not a baby. 534 00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,687 &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you are. &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm a big boy now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are a big boy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm missing my bright yellow jacket. Have you seen it lately? Because it's not here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's not here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, the only thing you got is the girls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Huh? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The girls. Didn't you tell them they could borrow something? &gt;&gt; KRIS: When did they ask me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I think it's just after you got out of surgery, and you were in recovery. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, on drugs? When I was on drugs, they asked me for like a serious question? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then they're smart. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The fact that they called me when I was in the hospital, and taking pain meds... pretty smart, Kendall and Kylie. I can't even keep track of what they've got and what they don't have. This closet is gonna be like Fort Knox when I get done with it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fine. Honey, I don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This will be shut and locked and bolted, and everything's gonna have a sensor on it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. 557 00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,049 You do that, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I will. You watch me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was going out to dinner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who are you going out to dinner with? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Couple friends. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What friends are you going with? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: People that you know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That bracelet's a little ridic. You don't want to say who? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's Jared's birthday. My old friend. Do you not remember him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You didn't even tell me, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Am I supposed to run everything past you? You don't run everything past me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't invite me to your dinner? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're gonna go out to Beverly Hills. At 9:00 at night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Never. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You didn't invite me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't run anything past me, ever. And if things happen, I just have to be involved. Like, are we having two kids? Are we having 12 kids? Are we getting on birth control? Not getting on birth control? I never know what you're really doing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like you're going to get checked to get a vasectomy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So that's a big thing that you don't run past me. Rob told me that Scott was really going to find out about getting a vasectomy, when he's never even mentioned that to me before. I mean, that's like a permanent decision that you're deciding without even running it past me or trying to let me know. It's just odd. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whatever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And if you don't think that you need to tell me that kind of stuff, then there's a problem. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney's very hypocritical in the sense that anything I do, I ask because I don't want to get her upset. But she rarely runs anything by me and what she's doing. I didn't do anything, by the way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you're not... you're never gonna tell me, though? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I 100%... that's why I didn't go through with anything. Because I knew you'd have some big opinion and tell me what I can and can't do or whatever. I'm not gonna cut this thing off without telling you, I... It's just... I was just checking my options. So now you're getting a little bit of your own medicine. How you treat me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney hates Scott right now. It's so funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: True. &gt;&gt; ROB: He thinks he's just like your baby maker to have sex with you twice a year, and, oh, you happened to get pregnant two times. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, this kind of scares me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe and I are at a fertility clinic so she can figure out what she can do to speed along her pregnancy process. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: What's of interest is that you may not have ovulated. 611 00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:56,768 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right now, I'm freaking myself out. What if I don't produce an egg? &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so pretty out here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Behind you, where those roses are, I'm going to transplant those roses. Those are kumquats. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love a good kumquat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kumquat. Oh. I thought you were my husband. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, I think I'm gonna go to like a fertility specialist. Just to see, because like I'm 31. I'm gonna be 32 this year and I have like some friends that are like going through it. Like my age, but she has like an illness, so she won't be able to have any more kids. She wants to freeze her eggs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But why do you want to go? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just because. I want to like maybe like freeze my eggs or something. Because if you've been like actively trying to have a baby for like years, two years, and you haven't gotten pregnant. It's just like you never know in life, you know. Have you gone to like a real fertility specialist? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The gynecologists haven't said I should. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going and I'm like not even trying to get pregnant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, but then what if I don't hear what I want to hear and then... &gt;&gt; ROB: Then you move forward. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ten you figure it out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been to doctors in the past and everyone, you know, will just check me out and say that I look fine. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So you've been trying to get pregnant? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. What do you feel for? &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Whether there's anything that shouldn't be like within the uterus. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dr. Crane called me back and he said that I'm A-Okay and there's nothing to worry about. I definitely am nervous to see a specialist because in the back of my head, I know that there obviously is a problem. This is just too much information. Like it really like gives me like major anxiety. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you can't run from your problems. You don't even know if you have a problem. But it's good to find out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. This is too much for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna make us an appointment, then. Okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yup. I'll be there, toots. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get in front. Move! I don't want to touch you. Little bitch. You run away. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, because I don't want you grabbing my ass. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you know how you guys told me about Scott and the vasectomy thing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I said something and he was like, "What are you talking about?" And I was like, "I know." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then he said, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney hates Scott right now. It's so funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not like I even said like, this is what I'm doing. Like having a million kids. Like I just said, "How many kids could we fit in this house?" Just like, I wasn't like having another one. &gt;&gt; KIM: Would you... you would want another one, though? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: True. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, he is wrong for going to the doctor's without talking to you. Yes. Do I think that you're a little wrong too for saying, "Well, if you don't give me a second child, I'm gonna find someone who will." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't. I just said there's other people that are glad to give me one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, just... my point is you can't say comments like that. Like if he doesn't want another child-- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But it's true. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, anybody. I'm sure there's 5 million people that want to impregnate you. Does that mean you want their sperm inside of you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I just said-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My point is you still have to listen. You guys have to talk it out and maybe in like a year or two he might feel different than he does right now. &gt;&gt; ROB: Honestly, just from being an outsider, I realize you guys, you're not really affectionate, but obviously it affects him. Because he thinks he's just like your baby maker and like what is my only purpose to have sex with you twice a year and, oh, you happen to get pregnant two times. Like and that's it? So... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you're gonna keep thinking about children without consenting with me, I'm gonna have to get a vasectomy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to grow up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For all I know, you'll go have the baby when I'm not looking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Probably. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Whatever your fertility is now, it's probably not as good as it was ten years ago. Starting in the 30s, they go down significantly. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is the line that I'm at right there. 701 00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:19,431 I'm three and a half years older than Khloe, so if anything I'm in a worse position. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ew! Whose gum is here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Guilty. Want to go hit Stoff's? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, but oh, my God! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Let's get her and get food but I have to get shoes from Mom's closet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ♫ Du-dun... ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't... this is never locked. Like I don't understand if someone's in here or if Mom did that on purpose. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What if Mom and Dad are in there? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ew, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Maybe there's a key somewhere. If I were a key... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Does this open or not? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ew, this smells like coffee every time you open it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. It's disgusting. Ooh, I remember this box. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He keeps it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's so cute. Fifty Shades of Grey? Mom, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Actually, I'm gonna steal this and read it. I Hate Everyone, Starting With Me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello, ladies. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: You having fun in there? There will be no more going into Mommy's closet unless I know about it, and as much as I would love to have you guys share my clothes, we're gonna treat it like a public library. We're gonna sign in. We're gonna sign out. There's gonna be a system that you have to be accountable for. I feel really bad about locking my closet and making it off limits for the girls, but it's not their personal boutique inside Mom's closet. So I've come up with a system. So you both can pick out an outfit and what we're gonna do is I'm gonna keep a journal. You're gonna check it out. You're gonna write it down with your name and the date and the time. When you bring it back and check out, you reverse the order. This is what you checked out and the time. Okay? Kylie, we can start with you. My closet is at your disposal, madam. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: The idea of signing a paper and taking a picture before you take something is just absurd. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why do you have to take the most expensive thing in the closet? Hold the item, please. Okay, smile. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What a sneaky little girl, locking us out of her closet. I guess she learned a few new tricks. Gonna have to think of things to get around her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One, two, three. Okay, good. So the camera's gonna be in here and I want this run like a well-oiled machine. You hear me, ladies? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. All right, let's go, Kylie. Come on. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you think you're doing? Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is 3:30. We don't sleep in in this house till that late. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You shouldn't be going out when someone could give birth at any second. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, like I went out to dinner. Went out for a little bit. Like chill. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And you don't check in? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't check in with me a lot of times with things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to grow up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Grow up? Because I went out to dinner? Went out for an hour? I don't know what you're up to half the time. For all I know, you'll go have the baby when I'm not looking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Probably. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you're gonna keep thinking about children without consenting with me, I'm gonna have to get a vasectomy. &gt;&gt; MARK: Khloe, you did not ovulate this month, and if you don't ovulate, then you can't... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have a baby. &gt;&gt; MARK: Conceive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if eggs don't come? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know what you're up to half the time. For all I know, you'll go have the baby when I'm not looking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Probably. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you're gonna keep thinking about children without consenting with me, I'm gonna have to get a vasectomy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wasn't making decisions what I'm doing for my future, but those are thoughts that I have, and I'm allowed to have them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So am I. I'm not like trying to fight with you on this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I'm not trying to fight, either. I'm just saying that... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Good, so we have a deal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to run things by me, and I'll run things by you. I definitely think Scott should have an opinion when it comes to our family and, you know, the size of our family and what we want to do, and I hope that us talking together and, hopefully, making a decision together, it will set the way of how we should do things in the future when making decisions. All right, so we agree that if you're going to get a vasectomy, we need to be in agreement. And if we want to have another, we'll have an agreement. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. Get it in paper this time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Toodles. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I just want to know if I'm fertile or not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Embryos. &gt;&gt; KIM: So scientific. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, this kind of scares me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Today, Khloe and I are at a fertility clinic, and I'm here just to get a little bit of information of what the process of freezing eggs is even like, and really to be a motivator for Khloe so she can really figure out if there's anything wrong or what she can do possibly to speed along her pregnancy process. &gt;&gt; JOANNE: Okay, so Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm married. I've been married for, um, almost three years. It's difficult with us, so that whole thing, but... &gt;&gt; JOANNE: Kind of your fertility potential is what you want to know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. I am happy that Kim has convinced me to come to a fertility clinic. I would rather be here with my sister rather than Lamar just 'cause if something is wrong, I would rather like digest it and then explain it to him. &gt;&gt; MARK: Hello, ladies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; MARK: Great. How are you doing? Nice to see you. Hi. How are you? So, uh, Joanne's been getting to know you guys a little bit. And, um, what I'd like to do is just to sort of review with you what normally happens. So there's a normal attrition between the number of eggs you make. Whatever your fertility is now, it's probably not as good as it was ten years ago. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; MARK: If you look at normal 825 00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:45,716 kind of population statistics, you see that starting in the 30s, they go down significantly. &gt;&gt; KIM: It gives me major anxiety to know that I'm not in my 20s anymore and this is the line that I'm at right there. I could either take after Khloe, who has like issues getting pregnant, or my mom and Kourtney, who don't, but I have less of a chance than Khloe because I'm three and a half years older than Khloe, so if anything, I'm in a worse position. &gt;&gt; MARK: We'd like to, um, get to know you ladies a little bit more by, uh, doing a couple of tests. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; MARK: So what we're gonna do is take some pictures through ultrasound of the area of the reproductive system, and we're going to look outside the uterus at the area of the ovaries. That'll enable us to, uh, let you know if this is something that's, uh, reasonable for you to do if you'd like. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. These ultrasounds, this blood work gets me thinking that maybe I really should go through with this and I should do it. It's better to be safe than sorry. &gt;&gt; MARK: So you're making lots of new friends here. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Why don't you just lie down? &gt;&gt; MARK: This is sort of a three-dimensional view, which is supposed to look a little bit like a triangle. That's kind of what it's looking like. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, that's positive. &gt;&gt; MARK: What's of interest is that... this little white line there, which is relatively thin because your hormones are probably low from having taken the pill. And that's okay, but you may not have ovulated. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; MARK: And, um, so then the question is, "How come?" And so that's what we're going to try to figure out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just want to make sure my body is okay and that I'm fine, and this doesn't sound good. &gt;&gt; KIM: He maybe went this way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, geez, weird. This test, to be honest, is not putting me at any ease. Not knowing what's happening right now with my body-- it's definitely a very anxious feeling. &gt;&gt; MARK: So, Kim, we got your stuff back. It sort of looks like if, in fact, you want to stimulate the ovaries to cryopreserve your fertility, you know, you could pretty much start at any time. So, um, we'll wait to see what you decide. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; MARK: Okay? Khloe, I'm going to chat with you a little bit. Your hormone levels are all normal, but as we kind of suspected from the ultrasound, you did not ovulate this month, and if you don't ovulate, then you can't... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have a baby. &gt;&gt; MARK: Conceive. &gt;&gt; KIM: How come she did not ovulate this month? &gt;&gt; MARK: Well, I can tell you your gonadotropin levels are supposed to be in kind of a certain range, uh, in order to indicate that you're going to likely ovulate on your own, and they're not in that range. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; MARK: When this is high, it means that you don't make eggs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if eggs don't come? Right now, I'm freaking myself out more because I think about, what if I don't produce an egg? 881 00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:07,551 You know, I'm... I don't know. Next on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim wanted me to go to the doctor's because like something's wrong, and I am not ovulating. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So they're bringing all the Olympic champions back for the Olympic trials. Eugene, Oregon, honey. &gt;&gt; MAN: You're one of the top 20 Olympic members. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Gold medalist Bruce Jenner. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kourtney might have her baby tonight. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mase, you know, we're going to go pick up your sister. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Ten centimeters. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Holyballs. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Push again. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
