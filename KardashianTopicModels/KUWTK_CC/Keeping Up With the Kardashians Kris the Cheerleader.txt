- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: âŞ I have mail I have mail I have mail at the house. âŞ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What is it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If I knew what it was I wouldn't have to open it, now, would I? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, open it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At my mom's house, we always get the weirdest deliveries for Dash. And I'm opening up a package that's there for me, thinking it's a regular... just delivery. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What did you order? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't order this. This is condoms. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You ordered condoms? For what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it teaches you how to put condoms on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's great. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, let me see it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, no, no. Girls, get out of here. You're too young for this stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, ah, ooh. Bruce, do you need one? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what you should buy Mom for Christmas? A vibrator. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't think she doesn't have one, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where... Oh, my God, let's look for Mom's vibrators. Does Mom really have one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She does. Should we go look? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I don't think she does. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, she does... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't know... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She doesn't have one! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's big and black. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like a ... ? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think she uses &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We'll know by the way it smells. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I<i>toldyou she didn't</i> have one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce does not believe that she has a vibrator, so now it is becoming that we're proving a point to Bruce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where's your vibrator that Shelly gave you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh... I don't think I have it anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is such She has one, it's hiding, and she doesn't want Bruce to know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have any ... ? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm fresh out of those, too, doll. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was right! I told 'em you didn't have one! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendal? What do you want for breakfast, honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendal, what do you want? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: I don't know, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's keep it moving. Well, do you want, uh, your waffle? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: No, you make 'em really bad! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendal, that's not nice. Are you turning into a teenager? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: No. I don't want a waffle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You want me to make your pancakes? Kendal? Kendal? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: What?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendal's really starting to cop this major attitude with me. Come on, get off the counter, please. She's definitely starting to change. No matter what we talk about, Kendal's upset. And all these changes are really familiar to me, 'cause I've been through this three other times. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, did you get the lunch tickets yesterday? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: I forgot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You forgot to buy you and your sister lunch tickets? Oh, Kendal... You know what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; TRACIE: May I speak to Kris, please? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is she. &gt;&gt; TRACIE: Hi, Kris. This is Tracie Hawkins from the Los Angeles Sparks Ol' School Crew dancers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, hi, Tracie. Are you looking for Kim? &gt;&gt; TRACIE: No, actually, Kris, we are looking for you, girl. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I get this call from a woman, Tracie, who's the head of the Ol' School Dance Team. &gt;&gt; TRACIE: We dance to old school jams, old school dance moves. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A group of over-40 women who dance at halftime for the L.A. Sparks basketball games. So what do you want<i>meto do?</i> &gt;&gt; TRACIE: Well, we would love for you to come and audition. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, I'm going to be a cheerleader? I wanted to be a cheerleader in high school, and right before cheerleading tryouts, I got a bad grade on my math test. When you get bad grades in high school, you don't get to cheerlead. So I missed out on that, but right now I've got another shot at it in life. Do you have uniforms? &gt;&gt; TRACIE: We do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow, this is sounding better all the time. Okay, well, Tracie, I'll call you back. &gt;&gt; TRACIE: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks. Hey, guys, I got the craziest phone call today. This lady called me and said she's the director of the L.A. Sparks women's basketball dance team. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They want Kim to be in it? cheerleader... No, they want <i>me to be in it.</i> 'Cause it's 40 and up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've got to be kidding. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You weren't even a cheerleader in high school, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: When my mom tells us that she's gonna audition to be a cheerleader, we're thinking she's absolutely psycho. She's, like, way too old to be wearing short skirts and dancing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I asked her if they had uniforms, and she said they have black spandex. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tuck the camel toe! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tighten, tuck and pull. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, do you know that Mom has a camel toe? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's a camel toe? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't talk about this! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One that goes up like this or what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When it goes up your crotch. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's sick! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ken? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you just help me put some of this stuff away? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you ever done a chore before in your life? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need to do something. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: No! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not cute to be a brat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Normally Kendal's so helpful, so it's kind of weird to see Kendal just kind of spaz out. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Kim! What are you doing on my computer? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just trying to find these pictures that I downloaded. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: You can look at them later. Get out. Haven't you read the sign on the front of my door? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just really shocked that I see Kendal having more of an attitude than I ever would've imagined. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendal, stop! Kendal, get out of my room! &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendal! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just think Kendal's going through that teenager time where she's coming into her own. And it's awkward and she doesn't really know what's going on. Maybe she's about to go through that womanly change and become just like us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Probably. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, do you know what a period is? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, when blood comes out of your vagina. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kylie, being younger than Kendal, is actually more comfortable talking about woman issues. And Kendal seems a little bit more uncomfortable talking about those kind of things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, do you know which one is which? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is a little thing you stick up your "va-jay-jay," and this is the... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know what they're called? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is a... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tampon. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Tampon, exactly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And that? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is a... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a pad. I know if a ten-year-old has these questions, obviously a 12-year-old must. So I feel like I should be forcing Kendal to sit down. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How do you use a tampon? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go get me a pair of panties. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; I'm good, how are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm here to see Tracie. &gt;&gt; Tracie? Okay, hold on one second. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. So I'm going to meet with Tracie from the Ol' School Dance Team. And I'm a little bit nervous because I have to audition. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello, how are you? &gt;&gt; TRACIE: Hello. Fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You must be Tracie. &gt;&gt; TRACIE: I am. How are you, Mr. Jenner? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I give you a dancing virgin. &gt;&gt; TRACIE: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A dancing virgin right here. &gt;&gt; TRACIE: Hi, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Tracie, how are you? &gt;&gt; TRACIE: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; TRACIE: My pleasure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what they're going to ask me to do, and I've got to step it up to kind of meet their standards. Good morning, everybody. &gt;&gt; ALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, I'm Kris. &gt;&gt; ALL: Hi, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, I'm so nervous. &gt;&gt; TRACIE: Don't be nervous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think it's pretty funny. Kris is actually nervous about this, whether she makes the team or not. You're going to be fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just don't take a team of people and then stick some new person in there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just get in there and do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See if you can hug me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have such a sense of rhythm, babe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, you are a geek. Bruce, you're embarrassing me. Stop it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, you've got to get into it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't do that. You're embarrassing, stop it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's a little trivia. When I graduated from high school and they have the "ideal senior," you know, in the yearbook? I got Best Dancer. Come on, hey. Come on, girls! Come on! I also got Most Athletic and Best-looking, so... but I don't know. That's... That's a whole another story. Class is over. &gt;&gt; Yeah, baby. &gt;&gt; Are we ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm ready. &gt;&gt; First thing... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Robin, &gt;&gt; ...tell her your part. &gt;&gt; I say, "Yo, Mo Mixer, you ready?" And then I go... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my. &gt;&gt; You have to do that part with &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, got it. &gt;&gt; Okay, we're going across the floor. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; You have your pants, and you're going to be moving all the way across. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't have a lot of dance background and experience in what we're doing here today. &gt;&gt; It's an attitude. &gt;&gt; Okay? And you got to have your head go... Yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to have a little bit of rhythm and a little bit of, you know, movement. &gt;&gt; You down? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I go down first? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then I go up. All of which I clearly have none of. &gt;&gt; Yo, Mo Mixer, you ready? Bust it! &gt;&gt; Six, seven and eight. &gt;&gt; One, two, three, four... Seven, eight. One, two, three, four. Five, six, seven, eight. One... Back pedal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm blowin' it! There's so many moves to learn, and all this information into my body is not coming out the way that I had hoped it would. &gt;&gt; Five, six, seven, eight. Pose! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dang it, you guys! This is just... My brain is too old. I totally blew it and messed up. It's, like, what are they gonna say? I know they're gonna be critical, and it's freaking me out. These girls-- they are really good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hmm. I know they are. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But you're holding your own. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, stressing me out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not holding my own. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; I don't think she quite has it yet. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. She needs some work... &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just so nervous. What if they don't let me dance? What if they say, "You're not hired"? &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Hop, hop, hop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh,! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so, what do you think? &gt;&gt; Here's what it came down to. We think that you're a great dancer, you have great charisma, but you need a little bit of work, a little practice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; So, we would love to have you at our game. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; Would you be willing to practice? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I- I totally would practice. I'm so shocked that they want me to be a part of the team, and so excited that they're going to give me another chance, because I really thought I blew it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what we ought to do is get you some little, uh, behind the scenes kind of training. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Call up Chris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Chris Judd is one of my closest friends and a fabulous choreographer. He's worked for tons of pop stars. He's my secret weapon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Chris Judd. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendal was giving me such an attitude last night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, me, too! &gt;&gt; KIM: She kicked me out of her room yesterday. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, she won't give me a hug anymore. I try to hold her hand... &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...and she pulls it away. Going into school, she wants me, like, ten feet behind her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendal's growing up, and that's the one thing Bruce didn't want to happen, and I think that - he's just, like, heartbroken inside. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been through this process before, which is... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's called hormones. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It is called hormones. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Puberty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I didn't want it to happen, but it's happening again. I don't know if this is a subject for me-- little girls growing up. It's nice to have these older girls that can kind of teach them about the first period, the changes, all these types of things, and you know what I think-- in this case, it's probably best for them to handle this, not me. This is, like, too much. Can I trust you girls to, uh, handle this whole hormone thing, to give good information? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I mean, we're the big sisters. It's better us do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All of her questions will be answered in complete and utter detail. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That is scary. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She needs to know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Handle it. I know you can do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We've got it, dude. &gt;&gt; CHRIS JUDD: All right, five, six, seven, eight, and boom, boom, ba, ba. That's... See, you're getting it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: You're gonna kill this routine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I think Chris explaining to me how to really do these moves is so much easier for me to understand. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Boom, boom. That's it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Suddenly, I'm beginning to get it. He explains why one move, you know, leads right into the next, and my confidence goes through the roof. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Let's go over it again. And five, six, seven, eight. And a one and a two, and a three, four, five, six, seven. Poom! One and two and three and four and five and six, seven, snap! One and two and three and four and five and six and seven, look. One and two and three and four. Five, six, seven, eight. And push, push, push, push, and da, da, boom, boom, up! &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was that? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: That was really good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I felt good about that. Okay, and then it's... &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Hop, hop, hop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh,! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; CHRIS: You okay? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, are you okay? I'm calling 911. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just totally, totally up my knee. Just as I feel like I'm getting all the moves down, and all I need to do is really put it together, one after the other, I fall, and I just get really mad. It's like I have all this anger towards my own body for kind of giving out, and I don't have any control. &gt;&gt; Hey, how you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. I really... &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Yeah, she felt her... She felt her knee pop. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, so we put some ice on it, and I feel like a rubber band just snapped. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm gonna pull up your knee real quick. Be careful. Let me see. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's getting all swollen in there. It feels like there's a lot of fluid or something. &gt;&gt; Does that hurt? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; That hurts? All right. We'll go ahead, and we'll put an ice pack, and we'll wrap it. Just hold it there for a minute. Thank you. I do suggest you see your doctor, and you have him check it out, and they have to do X-ray. I can't tell you exactly what's going on, because I don't have an X-ray machine, so it's just whatever you want to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I think... I think I'll go home. I'm gonna just lie down and see how I feel for a while. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If the problem with my knee is really serious and I miss my next audition with the Ol' School Crew, I am going to be so disappointed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you enjoying yourself in here? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ken, do you think something's going on with you? I think you're, like, just going through hormones. Do you know what hormones are? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Yeah, but I don't even think it's happening right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're trying to get through to Kendal, but she does not want anything to do with this conversation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We wanted to teach you, like, in case we're not here, or you're at school. You know, we want you to feel comfortable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And it is an embarrassing subject. Like I said, I got my period when I was 11, and I never told anyone for a year. We don't want you to be like that. We want you to be able to talk to big sisters if you don't want to talk to Mommy or Daddy. We need to find a way to teach this to Kendal so she's prepared. These are the facts of life, and comfortable or not, Kendal's got to hear about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, what did you What did you do to her, Chris? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: I didn't touch her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my poor little baby. But you got your glass of wine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. Chris gets me home, and my knee feels lousy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you hear anything snap? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I did. It was like a rubber band breaking. It's not getting any better, and I know that I've just got to call the doctor. &gt;&gt; DR. KORCHEK: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Dr. Korchek? &gt;&gt; KORCHEK: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; KORCHEK: Hey, Kris. What's up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Um, well, I was rehearsing a dance routine, and my whole knee just sort of gave out, but the pain is so incredible. &gt;&gt; KORCHEK: You could have torn something inside obviously, so I need to get a scan. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KORCHEK: All right, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KORCHEK: Take care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It really hurts. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I hate to see Kris going through this. I hope the injury is not that bad. Uh, I hope that we can rehab it and get her back in shape and get her back on the dance floor, but, uh, I think we're gonna have to have a doctor look at this one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good morning. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good morning. Admitting. This is it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. So I met Dr. Korchek, and he tells me that I need knee surgery, because I've ripped my meniscus. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. I feel really disappointed that I can't audition for the Ol' School Dance Team. I was really excited about it. I really felt like I could get it together and do a good job and be a part of the team. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, love you, good luck. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you. &gt;&gt; Bye. &gt;&gt; All right, I need, uh... &gt;&gt; All right... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know it's tough having my wife in surgery. &gt;&gt; I need, uh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been through this before-- two knee surgeries. I know how painful and how tough it is. Hopefully, the recovery's going to be pretty fast. Hey, Kendal, your mommy made it out of surgery; she's okay. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Oh, that's good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, she's in the recovery room right now. She's kind of having a hard time getting up on her feet, but, uh, we'll get her on her feet in a few minutes and get her home. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, well, Mommy's doing fine. I know you're concerned. Tell Kylie. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you, buddy. Have fun up there. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, sweetie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you feeling? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How's your knee? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's all right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, we know how much you really wanted to do your cheerleading thing, and you didn't get it in high school and this whole charade. So we really felt bad, <i>and...</i> we bought you something to fulfill your little cheerleading needs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ooh! Wow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, get excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Trashy." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How did you know I always wanted the cheerleader? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The girls, I think at first thought that I was out of my mind to want to try out for this dance troupe; but, at the end of the day, I realized they're pretty supportive. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I think that's very thoughtful of you girls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, I'm not going to let a little knee surgery keep me down. I'm not hanging those pom-poms up yet. I can't think of anything sweeter. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, yeah, they're sweet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, everyone. Kylie, you're my assistant. Come here. Okay, well, Kimberly and Kendal, just so you know, Kylie was asking a lot of questions about periods. The time has come to talk to Kendal, and I could just tell, Kendal is so uncomfortable. But this is nothing to be embarrassed about. This happens to every girl. Now, when you first start your period, you use a pad, okay? Kendal is squirming and just kind of sinking back into the couch. She's trying not to look in my eyes. She's trying just to look down at her hands. Once you become a little more comfortable with your body, what do we have, assistant? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: A tampon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What does a tampon do? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It soaks all the blood. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good job, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And it doesn't hurt. It looks like it hurts, but it doesn't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This little sucker, not so painful. Okay, we're going to show you a demonstration-- it opens up like a flower and it catches all the blood. See that? So the blood does not leak out of you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kendal is, you know, a little bit uncomfortable with the subject. But I think that either way, she definitely learned something and knows that she can always come to us when she has any questions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendal? Are you okay? You breathing? Everything good. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Sex Ed is not over. We're gonna watch some home DVDs. Since my sisters and I are trying to teach Kendal and Kylie about their bodies and all this kind of stuff, we think it will be really fun if we watched Kendal's birth video. Push play. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, Kendal, now these are your older sisters, okay? And someday, you're gonna look at these pictures, and you're gonna say, "Oh, my God! Look how young they were!" There's Mommy and Daddy. Okay, water broke. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not holding it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, they actually kissed! &gt;&gt; Let the air out. &gt;&gt; Breathe in again. &gt;&gt; Let the air out and push it down again. Push hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, tell me when we're done. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Oh, there's my... &gt;&gt; KIM: As we're watching Kendal's birthing video, I see that she's, you know, loosening up a little bit and getting a little bit more comfortable. I think she's starting to learn a few things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ugh! Mom peed on you! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did not! It's fluid from the sac. I think it's really special to see the the birth tapes. It really reminds me how fast Kendal and Kylie are growing &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here you go.
