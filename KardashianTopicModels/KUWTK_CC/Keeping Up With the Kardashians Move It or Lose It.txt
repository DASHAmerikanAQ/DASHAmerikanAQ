- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Shorty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Um, I can't really... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that mug on your face? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't talk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause I had my... ...'cause I had my whole face... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...numbed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I literally don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hold on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You went to the dentist? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. That's... not nice, stop. Khloe, you can't show anyone that. : ...nice, stop. I look like I'm dying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, this is definitely gonna be used at some point in life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is so insane. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So did you pack more? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm, I packed all the frames in my bedroom, bathroom... just, like, all my personal frames. And then I'll do, like, all my coffee table books and all that. I only have a few days left at my current home. I don't have a new house yet. In the meantime, I'm gonna be moving in with my brother. But I definitely don't want to get, like, comfortable there. I need to find where I'm gonna go. I just feel like once I have a plan, I'll feel better about everything. Doing, just, like, the bar, hopefully today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The kitchen and the bar is the worst. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. 'Cause that's, like, the most... glass, little &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Watch when I try to sniff my nose. Only one side works, watch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ugh. We have to go to New York. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And look at spaces for the Dash store. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But when? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The lease is up in October. But we still want to make sure to have time to do the work. Should we just go for, like, two nights? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Up to you. You're the one with the kids. I got nothing holding me back anymore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ah, my tooth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, you've got stuff on your shirt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew. This is just not my day. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Schemiel. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY:: What's happening, hot stuff? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hot stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are rockin' and rollin', babycakes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Damn, Gina. Hold on. Oh... I miss out in life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, isn't it weird to think you might be a ho again? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've never stopped being a ho. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. Ho for life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ho for life. Being married, you're still a... you need to still be a whore, with your husband. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I get it. I'm just saying, isn't it weird you could be a ho out on the streets again... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to be out on the streets. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...hustling hard? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to be out on the streets. Don't say that. That makes me so sad, by the way. Scares me. Lately, old friends have been texting me or e-mailing me, and I just have not been in the dating scene in a while. I mean, with Lamar and I, I'm... I get emotional about it every day, so to even try and think about dating anyone makes me really uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KIM: What did you order me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, uh, chicken. Grilled chicken with mushrooms. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just came from baby shopping. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: North, like, knows who her parents are. &gt;&gt; KIM: She definitely knows... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She does. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...who her, like, dad is, but she's really sweet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "I am North West, the shiniest star in the sky." ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know how Radar's gonna like this one. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What do we got, what do we got? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Something, with all this property, you need. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you giving me something? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it's not giving it, it's mine. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Whoa! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But you should get one. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Sounds like a lawnmower. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, there was a long time, there, where Brandon and Brody and my kids, we weren't that close, and we've talked a lot about it. You can't change the past and what happened. But we can move forward. And I hope Brody understands that. &gt;&gt; BRODY: See, I think he's excited to see you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah, yeah, he's excited to see me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Get him, get him, get him, yes, get him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yes, get him. Lick him to death. Come here. I know, I know, I know. That's okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I've been texting you and trying this and that and it's kind of tough to get a hold of you. I thought I'd do a drive-by. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You know how busy these guys keep me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. I... you're talking to a guy that raised ten children. Well, anyway, the reason I was trying to get a hold of you is, um, there's a golf tournament coming up. It's, like, father-son type of deal. I wanted to play with it. I need a son. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Mmm, to be completely honest with you... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; BRODY: ...I might not be the best partner for you, considering my knee and that I haven't played in months. So... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I say what we do is we set up a time, we come and we practice. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Uh, okay. We could do that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To be honest with you, this is not about playing in a golf tournament. Sometimes Brody can get pretty distant, and I'm trying to do everything to be able to share some good, quality time with him. &gt;&gt; BRODY: When is this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I don't know. It's like in a couple of weeks. I haven't really looked at the date, but it's in, like, a couple of weeks. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can I trust you on this, that you'll actually, like, show up and if-if we wind up doing this tournament, it's... we're going? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yes, absolutely. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Who we going up against? I bet you there's some good players out there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ah, there's probably... there's always good teams at these things. I gotta up my game for us to win. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Don't act like you do it all. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you even listening to me? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Don't act like you do it all. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Obviously, you're gonna need my help, 'cause you haven't practiced at all. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I can't wait till the day I get to beat you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know when you have a dream that you, um... pee? And you can really pee, like, while you're dreaming? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I... that almost happened to me on the plane. And I... literally, I woke up, I was like, "Wait! I'm not in the bathroom. Get up and go pee." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wish you would've done that. So what's the plan? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're going to see spaces, but in SoHo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Which we all said we should get out of. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. We just said our space sucks. The front entrance is annoying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Agreed. Kourt and I just arrived in New York, and we're meeting Kim here. She's with Kanye already. We really want to move Dash. It was a great first store in New York; it's just time for us to move. We've moved all of our other stores, and you live and you learn when you first open a store in a new city. Last time I was here, that's when... Lamar went missing. I remember I came home and I couldn't find him. That was sad. It's like everything I do just reminds me of Lamar. There's a lot of thoughts and memories and, you know, not necessarily memories that I want to think about right now. Is this the same hotel we stayed at? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that the same suite we're in? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-mm. We made sure of that, honey. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: What is going on? I cannot hang out with you with that. Seriously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? You don't like my coat? &gt;&gt; KIM: It really looks like a dead animal or something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, what do you think you wear all day? "you, fur." I just wanted to wear a " you, fur" coat because it's just fun to freak Kim out. Kim will cringe at anything with spray paint on it or that's faux fur, and it's just funny. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna walk really far away from you guys. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; JAY: How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; JAY: Nice to see you. We're gonna see a couple of sites today... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JAY: ...New York style. How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, how are you? Khloe. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; JAY: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My sisters and I started Dash together and we love to be as involved in the stores as we can, but because I don't live here, I'm hoping that the realtor, you know, guides us in the right direction. &gt;&gt; JAY: So, this is about 1,700 square feet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; JAY: It's a blank canvas. You can do with it what you want. There's some storage upstairs; office space as well. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Could you tear this wall down or no? &gt;&gt; JAY: Not all of it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. What is that leaking over there? &gt;&gt; JAY: Ah, it's probably just the result of the six snowstorms we've had recently. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JAY: Everything will be cleaned up. &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: There's a lot more construction that needs to happen. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really do love the space that we're seeing, but there's so much to do. And we need to be sure that we have the new space up and running before the old lease is up. Well, I feel like we can discuss. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shall we? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's get the ball rolling. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Yo, yo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is it? &gt;&gt; JAY: So, it's 800 feet. She's doing something bigger. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; JAY: And it's available. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I think this is too small for us. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, it's such a cute, quaint space, but I just feel like we would need something bigger. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And what area is this? &gt;&gt; JAY: This is Nolita. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think I'm down with this neighborhood. &gt;&gt; JAY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: None of the spaces we've seen today are really exactly what we're looking for. Luckily we do have some time to come back to New York to make sure that we find the perfect space. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I love you! &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, are you gonna be around if I have to call you later? Did you find out when you leave? And you just, you don't know anything? You're just leaving tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KIM: Who is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar. Like, you even know where you're living or, like...? You don't even have clothes. I have all your clothes. The team takes care of what? Where you're gonna live and get you clothes? I'll call you when I have a minute to talk to you. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: What was he saying about a team? Isn't it playoffs? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not in this country. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, that's good if he would play for a different country. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I'm not very happy about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause he's far away? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's leaving and I don't get to say good-bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: When is he leaving? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tonight probably. &gt;&gt; KIM: This was Khloe and Lamar's whole plan. He was gonna play overseas and she was gonna go with him. And Khloe might not see this right now, but I think it'll push her into distancing herself and starting to live her life for her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I said, "I'm sorry." Cheers! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Watching Khloe take her mind off of the negatives with alcohol definitely scares me. Calm down, Khlo. If I'm seeing it, that must be a lot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where was the jewelry-- in this drawer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We need to call the police immediately. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In the middle of my move, I just discovered that someone took the majority of Lamar's jewelry. I just want to know who took my &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. Let me ask you a question. Rob got this for me for Valentine's Day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob Kardashian or Scheppy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Is that awkward? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's so cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. Are you cleaning this out for your move? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm trying so I don't have to put... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aw, are these your wedding flowers? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's from when we redid our vows on my first... anniversary. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think it's time to burn it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar is now doing press 'cause he's on a new team, and he's giving these interviews and answering questions about him and I, but they're just not true. Saying that he talks to me every day or that we're working things out. And I feel like people are almost questioning have I done enough? But I can't reach him for months on end. I would just rather him not say anything because it almost, like, gets my hopes up and then nothing ever changes. Do you know the interviews he's doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Saying that being married to me were the best years of his life. He's now wearing his ring full- time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:your ring. You were wearing it when you wereing someone, too. He doesn't think we're going through with the divorce. I'll always be his wife and he'll never call me anything else. Whatever. He's now finally, like, admitting that he's done up The way I was living was, is not a way to live! I kept in hiding every time there was something going on. I would have to lie or conceal or cover up. And I'm so over it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Going through a breakup with someone that you thought you were gonna spend the rest of your life with cannot be easy. One day she's sad. One day she's happy. One day she's angry. So, it's really hard for me as her sister to just watch her go through these emotions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Hey, babe, he's wearing his wedding ring in Spain. Are you guys talking?" Shut up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who's that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One of Lamar's friends. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's delusional! Let me tell you something! Last year on my birthday, I lied to everyone because I had to lie and say I was with my husband when, in fact, my husband was missing with another girl! Okay? And I lied and I gave up my Beyoncé tickets to Kendall. That's how badly I was hiding. And I didn't have a birthday. I was alone and lied to everyone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Slowly, uh, loading up on toys, Brandon. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Paddleboards, RC helicopters. Still got that big kid thing going, you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Nothing wrong with that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Before we go, I got to ask you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The Brod-ster. I've, like, been calling him, getting no response. He never calls me back. It's, like, frustrating as hell. One thing that's been tough is getting Brody to commit to something. He's busy. I understand that. But I'm really trying to spend time with him. And then, it's tough to get a hold of him. That frustrates me. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: These are the things that, you know, we've always, we've known for quite a long time. It's just, he's just impossible to get a hold of. I mean, literally, and it-it's actually kind of a good thing, because he's not attached to his phone, he's not, like, attached to anything. Sometimes he just disconnects... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, but sometimes it's called being responsible. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I know it's frustrating, but don't take it personally. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: 'Cause it's ju... it's just the way it is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Yeah. It's just... Maybe we could change the way it is. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Uh... good luck. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then, let's go paddleboarding. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm gonna, let me go change. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Don't forget your booties. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here's to... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: To Kendall coming home? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure. To Kendall coming home. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just so in shock. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I didn't know this was all going on. I didn't think anybody was even here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe's having a spontaneous house party. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I text... Whose? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe's. This is Khloe's party. So, do you want some earplugs? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here, I have earplugs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it's okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you sure? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I left my hearing aids out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You won't even know what's going on. Kendall's been quite the jet setter, and away working for a very long time, so Khloe decided to throw her a welcome back party. It's a little last-minute for having something this elaborate at the house, but I love it when all the kids come together, so it'll be fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; MASON: The winner! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Want to go with me? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yes! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's do it! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Been cruising. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you leave, I'm literally going to punch you in yourthroat. Do you understand? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I wouldn't go anywhere really. Both Khloe and I have had a tough year and a lot of problems and, you know, watching Khloe kind of take her mind off of the negatives with alcohol and partying and all these things definitely scares me because I've been there before. Calm down, Khlo. If I'm seeing it, that must be a lot. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Sit down, relax. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What are you stressing about? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not. I don't know why I'm in, like, a weird mood all of a sudden. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How have you been? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Didn't mean to kick you out... bang! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, Mom? I've been trying to actually reach Lamar 'cause I want to cuss him theout. He called me when he landed. "I touched down." Acting like it's all peachy keen. He also in quotes yesterday said how he talks to Bruce every day. How he talks to you almost all the time. And that I'm coming to visit him soon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then... what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just, I really... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Hmm" what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He probably just wants things to go back to the way they were because he, like, thinks that if he starts just behaving that way, that you'll accept him back, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You always will stand up for him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't, I'm not taking his side, I'm not buying into what he's saying. I'm just telling you that I love him very much, and I want him to be okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's available if you want tohim and date him. I just hate that things are being painted almost in, like, his benefit or to make him look like he's trying, but, you know, I was the one that was always begging, "Please, let's fix this, let's go to therapy." And, you know, it's kind of heartbreaking when your mother doesn't take your own side. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What am I doing? I'm here waiting for you. I don't want to come down too hard on Brody, but punctuality is important. Because it shows you care. Just get your ass here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, this is your life now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're, like, this party girl? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is my life now: utilize the 24 hours in the day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She just needs to deal with her emotions and not just mask them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey! Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you have a charger in here? Grazie, mi amore. "mi amore." &gt;&gt; KIM: Wedding deets, wedding deets. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so excited. Do I get, like, a bridesmaid's dress out of this thing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I feel so good. I got the location contract we've been working on for three months. Like, I just finally feel like we're, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At a good place. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where are we going? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to run by a liquor store real quick for my fiesta. I only have a few more nights left at my house. And so I wanted to have, you know, a little evening of good last-minute memories. Let's get a little alcohol on. Hey, Mom, I'm gonna throw, like, a little Khlo Money party. What liquor should I get or, like, should I do a theme this time? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just have a variety of alcohol, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No! Don't give her any tips. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hold on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't give her any tips. She's turning into a party animal, drunky monkey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is... First of all, 'cause I throw a party once every three months at Mom's house, a house party...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just saying I don't know what you do every night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so judgmental. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're in your 20s. Have some fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just saying I'm conc... have concerns. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you, Mom. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get plenty of vodka. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm using my Kegels 'cause I need to pee. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are disgusting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where's the party girl? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, party bitch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Good to see you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, I'm actually really mad that I did not go to the Pharrell event last night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What was it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I heard it was, like, one of the best parties in a long time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, this is your life now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're, like, this party girl? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not everyone likes to go to bed at 9:00 p.m. And sometimes if it's socializing, so be it. This is my life now: utilize the 24 hours in the day seven days a week... 365. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm... mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's obvious that Khloe's trying to occupy her time with partying because I think she just doesn't want to face that she's moving out of the home that her and Lamar built together. But I think she just needs to deal with her emotions and not just mask them. All right, Malika and I and Scott are leaving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's, like, 8:00. You're not leaving early. The fun is just getting started. You're not leaving. Put your bag down. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe, I actually like sleep. That's the difference between me and you. Khloe, stop! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let people go home! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Stop! What theis wrong with you?! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, this is bad. Get her in the closet with Malika! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Oh... oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got her, Khlo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got her! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's see how long she sits in there for. Hey! Kourtney! Kourtney! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, this girl's nuts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, you little bitch! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe, she's this way! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey! That's locked. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look, there she goes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let her in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who is it? Who is it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott Disick's ride. Scott, we're leaving. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. Where is he? Yes? &gt;&gt; BRODY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What am I doing? I'm here waiting for you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, don't even get me started. I've been running around my house since 9:00 in the morning dealing with the fence people and the city of Malibu and the dogs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just get your ass here! &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm trying. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good-bye. I don't want to come down too hard on Brody, but punctuality, returning phone calls, you know, getting back to people immediately, uh, is important because it shows you care. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't want to hear it, okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We had a golf game. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You know what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want to add pressure to your life. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I mean... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just trying to help you. If you're so busy, do you even want to do the tournament? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Of course I want to do the tournament. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. All I want to do is spend some good quality time with Brody. And sometimes I really get the feeling that he really doesn't want to spend time with me. And, I mean, that hurts. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Dad's getting so crazy over this golf tournament that he wants me to play in. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: "You're not coming? What?" &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's-it's funny, but at the same time, if I don't get back to him, and I'm not like, "Hey, let's go practice," he's like, "Should I cancel it?" &gt;&gt; BRANDON: If you want to have that kind of relationship, then that's what it takes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you drunk? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm worried about how you're feeling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I don't want you to be weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not-not being weird. I'm not being weird! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not. Anything I have to say, she's gonna snap at me. I really do feel like there's a lot more going on inside than she lets on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How long do we keep these pictures of Lamar up on the walls? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRODY: We doing this? We gonna get some racing in? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, I'm so ready. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; ATTENDANT: Looking good. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is yours slow? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, I just... I don't know, I just... that car, it was to me, like... you know how some of these cars are. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. Of course, I know. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Blame it on the car. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Kendall's... good. She is really good. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know she's good. I know she's good. I mean,, she smoked me. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Nice job. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ow. &gt;&gt; BRODY: God. That is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What's ridiculous? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Dad. He's being... he's like, he's getting so crazy over this golf tournament that he wants me to play in, but, like... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Why, what is he saying? &gt;&gt; BRODY: If I don't get back to him and I'm not like, "Hey, let's go practice," he's like, "Should I cancel it? Should I..." He's asked me ten times now if... if he wants to, if he wants me to cancel it, 'cause he doesn't think I'm gonna be there. He keeps being like, "You're always late," and he's harping on me constantly. And I'm gonna play, I want to play, it's just, like, he's taken it to the next level. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's how he is, man. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Does he do the same to you? I mean, does he ever... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I feel like he's like that with everybody. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: And he gives people &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's like... : "You're not coming? What?" You know, he does that whole thing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's like, it's driving me crazy, I'm like... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That was so good. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's funny, but at the same time, I feel like you can do no wrong in his eyes, sometimes. &gt;&gt; BRENDAN: In the past, I would drop stuff to show up, to do all these things, for quite a while. Whereas, like, you know, maybe you haven't done that as many times. Dad'll tell me, he goes, "Yeah. Kendall and I, we had breakfast this morning, went to IHOP, you know. Well, we really like that place, we like our..." You know? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, I do things with him. I-I-I take time out of my day to go do things with him. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You know, either if you want to have that kind of a relationship, then that's what it takes, is just kind of like sacrificing some stuff. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Like with here, with you guys, he's giving me right now... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You know, you just gotta be direct. Just be direct to him. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He's like, "Come on. You ready to go hit the balls?" I'm going... I'll please him a little bit and be like, "Yeah, okay, maybe if I get done, but..." &gt;&gt; BRANDON: But if you give him that little bit of hope like that, then he's, that's... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, then... yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You gotta shut it down. It's the only way with him. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Understandable. However, I just want to have a good time at the golf tournament. I just want it to be fun. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's-that's... his whole life is serious. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know, but I should... I need to go talk to him or something and be like, "Yo..." &gt;&gt; BRANDON: When was the last time he did anything just for fun? Even paddleboarding. It's like, "All right, I'll race you to the pier." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: "All right, let's go!" &gt;&gt; BRODY: Great talk, guys. Let's get out of here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at this jacket. It says "N" and then it says "Go West." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. &gt;&gt; KIM: How cute is that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where did you get these? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Khlo. You look cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Duh. Is that a sheer top for a bebs? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have the same one in Fendi and we're both gonna wear it together. you do. Um... &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys are so dressed up and I'm in sweats. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh... &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I always wear sweats. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you never wear sweats, you're always in a cocktail dress. My body is so painted brown, I can't touch anything in this room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I could stand like this and it looks pretty good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, how do you feel about everything in the last few days? I mean... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you sad? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know what I am, man. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you drunk? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Even though I admire Khloe and how strong she is, I still worry. She's still my baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to be at Rob's, and tomorrow let's throw a good-bye party. I'll have a little company over and, like, have a little fiesta, man. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe always tries to put her best face forward, but I really do feel like there's a lot more going on inside than she lets on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe... I-I'm just worried about how you're feeling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have time to process my feelings, 'cause I am in... I'm constantly busy. What is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're being weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's weird that you're suddenly over there. I'm just talking to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because you're weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, please be nice to me... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I am nice to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...for five minutes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want you to be weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not being weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hate when you're weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not being weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not. Calm down. Anything I have to say, she's gonna snap at me, so the best thing for me to do is just wait for the storm to pass. I just wanted to tell you that I was really proud of you for the way that you've handled everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I'm really proud of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think you are... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want you to know that I'm here for you, through... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I know. You are such a stunner. Just so gorgeous. Can I get out of this white room? How long do we keep these pictures of Lamar up on the walls? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't like when you put the energy out there like I'm lazy or I'm not doing anything, because that's not the case. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been reaching out... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...for the last few years, and it's just, it's easier with Brandon. You're really masking something, you're hiding something, you're avoiding something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce definitely has a point, but... let me laugh instead of cry and let me enjoy the moments that I can. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Who's that? Who's this? Who's that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Radar. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Who's that? Who's that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't believe it. I text you all these times and I don't get an answer and now you show up. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What's up? Look at you. Are you stressing about this tournament? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Are you still doing it or what? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, my God. If you keep asking me... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I keep texting you and stuff. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, but it's like you're hilarious with this. I... Okay, sit down. I need your attention, your undivided attention, because you need to listen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hit me with it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: In all seriousness here, I love the fact that you want to reach out now and that we're bonding and that, you know, we're spending more time. I love that. I don't like when you put the energy out there like I'm lazy or I'm just going on surf trips or I'm not doing anything, because that's not the case. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't mean to do that. I've been reaching out for the last few years to try to make you guys my priority, and it's just... it's easier with Brandon. He comes over all the time. He actually calls me to see how I'm doing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You're right. There is a different type of relationship between you and Brandon than you and I. I'm gone tw... like, all the time-- I travel. Brandon is doing his music with Leah. They're pretty much there. They're in Malibu 24/7. They are around; I am not. I have 101 things going on, and it is hard for me. But I will try to make sure that I will be able to make it on time when you want me there as opposed to just kind of making you happy to be like, "Yes, okay, I'll be there to practice" and then disappoint you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let's have fun at the golf tournament. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I won't... I'm not gonna be bugging you all the time. I'm there. Call me. Put me on your priority list. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I feel better about all of this. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I... Do you, though? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I appreciate the two of us talking about this. I will try to lighten up. The bottom line is all I want to do is spend time with Brody, build a great relationship. I mess up sometimes. Brody messes up sometimes. But if you're gonna have a close, loving relationship, you both have to kind of forgive some things and move on. Life's very short. I think the relationship's gonna work out. It's just gonna have to take some work. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I will be ready to play, I promise. And I just... Yeah, go easy on me. When I shank one or two, it's not a big deal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, that's okay, that's okay. 'Cause then I'll... I can carry you, don't worry. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You can carry... Okay, you know, now I tell you, you're talking up a lot of game, so now you better be really kicking some ass. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khlo? Did you already start a pile? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. This could just be packed. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This could be packed. Do I save pregnancy tests now that I'm not getting pregnant? I don't know if I should throw those away or give them to someone. I think this we could put in Lamar's man room, I guess. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Bruce. I'm in the kitchen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's happening, babe? There's nobody sweeter in the world than good old Khloe, and I hate to see her go through tough times. So I just really want to talk to her and let her know that I'm here for her and love her. Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You haven't turned to alcohol, have you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, that's from last night. We had people over. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good, 'cause don't get to the drinking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Just had people over. I mean, if I'm not sleeping. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, have me over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come over whenever you want. I'm always here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? You're always here, awake? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, not whenever you want. I'm gonna be out of here in a few. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. That's true. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, you can come over here and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that gonna be sad? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm more stressed out than sad. I don't have time to, um, think about it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe that's why you're not sleeping. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I mean, definitely I'm sure I'm stressed, but I'm so, like, immune to it, I don't even know, like, what that feels like anymore. I can't really tell you what I am. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I love witnessing this therapy session between the two of you, but I got things to do, okay? You take care of her, Brucey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll take care. She's all mine. I've been doing this forever. Well, my only concern is you. I have noticed that I think you're going out more to kind of be social, trying to be around people all the time. And a lot of times when that happens, I know y-you're really masking something. You're hiding something. You're avoiding something. You want to be able to deal with, with all the stress in your life. I'm worried about you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce definitely has a point to what he's saying. I know I can't hide everything forever and I'm not trying to. But my personality is more to, like, let me laugh instead of cry, and let me enjoy the moments that I can. I mean, I do have, like, so much going on, like right now I'm in the middle. I have to be out in a few days. Lamar's in Spain. He just, like, left me with all of his He, like, doesn't realize how much stuff that adds to my plate when I don't have a house yet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can solve one problem. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come out, live with me in Malibu. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm not gonna live in Malibu. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why not? It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's... I'm not saying it's not beautiful. It's just so far from everything. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it's-it's... I can get, uh, literally, I can get from this house from my... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But that's not my life, 'cause Malibu isn't my... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 20 minutes, 20 minutes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, that's not my world. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not out in the middle of nowhere. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not, like, my realm of, like, what I do every day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe you need a change. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really have no idea what I'm doing. There's... I'm just scared. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: What are you missing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Eight pieces of jewelry. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: They were here? These two? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. This is probably the last thing I want to be thinking about or doing on my moving day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't help it that somebody has the balls to walk into your house and steal several hundred thousand dollars worth of stuff from you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey, I want to see your game today. Show me. Show me the money. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll show you the money. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'll show you... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here we go, and you're doing this on no practice, right? &gt;&gt; BRODY: How funny is this, though? We didn't even plan this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, we wound up with the same shirts. &gt;&gt; BRODY: When do we start? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: 1:00. &gt;&gt; BRODY: 1:00, okay. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: No smile, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; HANK: Appreciate y'all coming out. We have a, we have a good time out here, so I hope y'all come out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. All right. &gt;&gt; HANK: Just so y'all know, my name's on the tournament, so y'all are fighting for second place. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah, yeah. Obviously need to have a big handicap. Brody, Brody? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Wh-what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where did you get this thing? What do you got? &gt;&gt; BRODY: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Swing lube? It soothes the hand. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Liquid confidence? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that what it's come down to? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Liquid confidence. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: A little Gatorade. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's, you got to relax a little, is that what it is? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, but, look, look. You see the tea? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRODY: A little, you know... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Swing lube, it might help. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It might, you never know. Birdie. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Brode. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Aah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Solid. There we go. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Excellent. Dad, would you want a sip? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Am I of legal age? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I think. &gt;&gt; MAN: Right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, mama, old enough to drink. Yeah, here you are. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Cheers. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, check the I.D. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Moving on. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Moving... Man. &gt;&gt; BOTH: Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yea... Oh! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh! Aah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, five under, guys. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Five under. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Well, it's a lot... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Jeff, it was a pleasure. Good luck with the training. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Thank you, Bruce. Thank you. Appreciate you coming out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it was my pleasure. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, that was fun. fun. Got some good shots in there. &gt;&gt; BRODY: And it was good hanging with you. Always love hanging with you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Swing lube-- I've never even heard that expression. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Trash, trash, trash. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right, let's set it here. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's really sad. It... Like, when I walked in, I was, like... "It's so empty." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, her new house will be much better for her. Too many weird things have happened here, I think. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Anything else you want me to take? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you leaving right now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Just wondered. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, let's finish up in my bedroom. Oh, this is trash. Who waswith my safe? We are in the middle of my move, and, you know, I just discovered that someone selectively took the majority of Lamar's jewelry. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Are you sure he just doesn't have it with him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. The last time I saw everything was when he first went to Spain. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo, where was the jewelry? In this drawer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We definitely need to call the police. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel horrible. I feel, like, disgusted. I don't know why someone would steal from me. And I don't know why someone would steal only Lamar's stuff. I've been violated so much recently. It's one more thing that it's... Like, it's like almost the straw that's breaking the camel's back. There's not much more I could really put up with. I just want to know who the was in my home and decided to take our... Like, Lamar... Like, so vulnerable already. Who took my? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: These are all things that can be dealt with. You know what I mean? Like, you have so much good that's about to happen in your life. Like, don't let this ruin it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to tell me when? Like, how I feel... I'm the responsible one, and I lose all of his jewelry? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You didn't lose it, Khloe. You were trying to be responsible, and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I failed in that aspect, as well. I failed... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You didn't fail. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, I did. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You didn't fail, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I couldn't watch jewelry. It's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, get out of here. Don't blame yours... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, you're not the jewelry babysitter. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No way! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't help it that somebody has the balls to walk into your house and steal several hundred thousand dollars worth of stuff from you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. How are you? I'm Kris. My daughter lives here, and, um, we're moving stuff out, and when we opened up the jewelry drawer, all of her husband's jewelry is missing, and it's a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of stuff. This is Kourtney, this is Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. Khloe. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: Hi. I'm good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe lives here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now the cops are here to take fingerprints and to start an investigation. This is probably the last thing I want to be thinking about or doing on my moving day, but business is business, and I have to take care of it. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: Your husband didn't have access to it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: So we don't think it's just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My husband's been in and out of the country, and prior to that, he... This house-- all of the locks have been changed. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: Any of his assist... Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, he doesn't have any assistants. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: So, none of his assistants or anything would say, "Hey, I want my jewelry"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He doesn't have any assistant, and he-he was... He was very upset when I called just to... Just to confirm what I already knew-- that he didn't have it when I called him. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's only a small group of people that are in my home and know where our jewelry is and especially that would know the pieces to take. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: What are you missing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Eight pieces of jewelry. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: They were here? These two? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. I now have to question and look at the people that I love and that I let into my home differently. It's a very weird feeling. Thank you. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: We'll, uh, give it to the detectives. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, and the video guy said, 24 to 48 hours, they could have that security footage to you, so I'm doing that tomorrow. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: Okay, we'll put that in the report. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; POLICEMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Don't cry, Kris. I can't. I can't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I just can't believe she's out of here. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At the beginning, that house had so many phenomenal memories, and at the end, there are memories that I don't want to remember. I feel, like,, but, you know, I guess that was the way it was supposed to end. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's Thailand, ladies and gentlemen. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, I'm ready for Thailand. Where's Rob? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this a joke? He's not coming? I feel like I failed my family because everyone was relying on me to get him to Thailand. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall, it's so fun! &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, there's a mirror so you can see yourself... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: See... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really excited about this selfie book that I'm making for Kanye. &gt;&gt; MAN: Your mom had an accident in her car. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Who had a car accident? &gt;&gt; MAN: Apparently, a little bit hurt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's hurt? &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom's hurt?
