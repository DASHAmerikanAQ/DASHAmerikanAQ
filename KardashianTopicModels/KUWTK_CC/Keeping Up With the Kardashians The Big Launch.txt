- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So tell us about your vacation with Mason. How was it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye and I, like, had this whole plan... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, who walks him to the airport? &gt;&gt; KIM: Seats were all separate, and I lose my mind on everyone. We go to the airport. Everyone was trying to take pictures, so we literally... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need to get a family aircraft. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kardashian Aviation! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! Can we get... I want a 787, John Travolta-style. Pimp it out... &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you have $30 million? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We need a $5 million aircraft. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We need the money? I thought we just wanted a plane. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Or a $6 million plane. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tyler Perry offered to sell me his plane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. Excuse me! We're gonna get a 787. We're gonna put beds in it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We should get a Challenger. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I fly with Puff, Puff has a whole back room... it's a bedroom. It's a bed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who needs that, really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is this how hoes, like, type? With their nails? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know, I rarely have long nails. I only do it, like, once a year. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's talking about me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean Kim-- Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's calling me a ho. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right. So what is the deal for New York? You're leaving Saturday? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna go. Kanye has a fashion show on the tenth for Yeezy Season 2... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...if you guys want to come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How did that happen already? Season 2? &gt;&gt; KIM: And the day before that, we do our app launch. They got to preview the apps, like, on the phones. Everyone's loving it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: My sisters and I are launching our new apps. We have a big event in New York. We've been working endless hours of the night to make sure that they're perfect. I don't think all five sisters have ever done a big deal together and I'm excited for the world to see it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need to actually talk to them again, 'cause they are only putting me in one category, which is more mom stuff, which I said, "I am a person who does other things, too." They don't, like, get me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, they said you kept on saying you didn't want to do subscription, you didn't want to do content, you didn't want to do this... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I didn't. They were just, like... They don't know what they're doing with me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I think you should maybe suggest, like, what you would be comfortable with, 'cause I don't know if they know where... what direction to take you in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know the stuff that I'm passionate about. I'm given them, like, exact plugs. I think they've kind of dropped the ball... &gt;&gt; KIM: And they think you dropped the ball. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what they're saying. But I don't want towith people like that. Talking &gt;&gt; KHLOE: During the time that my sisters and I were working on our apps, you know, Kourtney was preoccupied because of the baby, and she's also had a pretty tough year. But trying to shift the blame as to why her app is late is delusional. The truth is, Kourt, you dropped the ball. Have you seen the movie theater? What? Let's go see the movie theater. She did drop the ball. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. She just doesn't want to do it now. She's pissed that we're all doing it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, she should be. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. ♫ ♫ How funny is this video? Let me show you. How cool do I look, by the way? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Her name is Kim. She's gonna be famous when she grows up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't that so funny? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Who says that? "She's gonna be famous"? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's Khloe talking. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Weird! &gt;&gt; KIM: So funny, right? So... I just wanted to go over with you... So you're gonna walk in Kanye's show. Like last time. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh... &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like you're totally, like, the vibe of Yeezy, you know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, no, I love doing it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie's walking in Kanye's fashion show. Kylie did the show last year, so she definitely knows the drill and knows how it is. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's like you're a thing. Kylie has a really cool, like, unique look and Kanye wants kind of, like, these underground, really cool vibes. And, you know, I always get nervous. I've been hearing things, like Kylie makes people wait 'cause she's on her phone, or if she's at photo shoots, she brings a ton of friends. So I just want Kylie to know just because Kanye's family, like, this isn't, like, a casual situation. She has to be really professional and go with the flow. You know, he's, like, such a perfectionist, obviously. And this is, like, a really big deal, to do a-a second show. His first show did so well. You know, and the second one, it's like, even that much more pressure. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mmm, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I just want it to be perfect. It'll be so much fun. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I just want you to, like, be profesh. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I will. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you were last time. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MASON: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come here, she's in the garage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Mason, you look so cute! And you have tattoos? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And a necklace? Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. You look cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You like this outfit? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's Kim's. But look at this. Wouldn't this look cute? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, wait a sec and then we'll go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love this cut. She has a body double. She has somebody come over here and put a prosthesis on, like a pregnant person, and she makes them try on all of her clothes because she's too tired to do it. And then she puts the pictures... How great is this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That doesn't look like Kim's size. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is the body double gonna start eating beignets? Because she needs to get a bigger ass. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, let's go inside. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. What day are you gonna leave for New York? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not till Sunday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And what's the plan with the kids? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's three nights, and so I was hoping that you could be around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is Scott gonna be around? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. So we'll see. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So if you could just be available... I'd rather someone else be there, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then Reign's coming with me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's really good that you're going and, like, leaving the kids at home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why is that good? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just think it's good for you to get out and about for a little while. And you're going to the big app announcement for the girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why is it "for the girls" and not for me? I don't get it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because your app isn't launching. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But then-then why am I going? I'm not going if it's not-not about me. I knew that my app was going to be behind, but I didn't really realize that mine was the only app that wasn't going to be launching. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I ask you a question? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How come you didn't do what every... your other four sisters did... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and do what they wanted you to do and keep up with the program? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They didn't. Not one person has bothered me about this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Jeff said you didn't even want to take meetings with him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I did. First of all, I just had a baby, so when he was maybe meeting, we may have pushed some meetings and said, "I'm unavailable for these two months." They had me for months before. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, two months was like... the crunch time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He should've said... he should've then communicated. He never explained any of this to me. So you guys need to have a conversation and figure it out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But you were at all the same meetings that everyone else was at. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I wasn't. What meetings? &gt;&gt; COREY: I want you to watch a lot of good movies that you missed out on. Boyz n the Friday, you haven't seen... Boyz n the Hood? &gt;&gt; COREY: You didn't have the right African-American man in your life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I could stay, too. I just had a baby... &gt;&gt; KIM: So what? Everyone in life has a baby and they work, like, ten jobs. You're not special. Sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, Felicia! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys need to have a conversation and figure it out. He never explained any of this to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But you were at all the same meetings... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I wasn't. What meetings? What meetings? I'm not going if they're not talking about mine. There's absolutely no point... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Of course they're gonna talk about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...for me to go. So you'd better figure this out, bef... 'cause I need to cancel my travel and all my plans. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're the one who was supposed to be having the... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not figuring this out. Get him on the phone now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Kris, Jeff Berman on line one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Jeff. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Hey, I've got Jen with me. &gt;&gt; JEN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Jen. Kourtney's right here. We were talking about the thing in New York. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is there a reason no one communicated to me that mine would be pushed? &gt;&gt; JEN: First of all, to build these apps takes a few months. You know, Kourt, you've had a lot going on. There was a lull in... for the communication. Um, because of that lull, logistically, it's not physically possible. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But she's just wondering, is it worth her coming to New York? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Yeah, I mean, I think it will be an opportunity, obviously, for Kourtney to talk about why she's doing this and why she's excited about it and what she's planning. But it's not ready, and, you know, we're gonna launch when it's ready. So long as she's comfortable with that, I think it's great if-if she can be there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JEFF: It's-it's ultimately really up to her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JEN: So, Kourt, why don't you just think about it for another day and let me know, like, where your comfort level is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, cool. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, we are gonna stunt on these hoes like no one ever knew. This is New York Fashion Week, so this is one of the craziest weeks that you could be in New York City. Our apps are launching this week. Kendall's walking in the Givenchy show. Kylie is modeling for Kanye's show. Oh, I used to love doing Fashion Week with my sisters. And now I get to do it with two more sisters, so it's that much more fun. You guys, why don't we just have a threesome and then, like, have our own... What could our name be? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Um, let's see, Khlo... &gt;&gt; TYGA: Khloe, Khloga. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Khloga? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I like Khloga. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Should we just date and then you should date someone else? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, probably. &gt;&gt; TYGA: Khloga. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: T is here. I'm just really happy that we get to spend a little time in New York. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I saw you wore my my magazine cover came out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, you have a magazine cover in it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I sh-- it's for my book; that's why I showed you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You did not show me a magazine cover. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At your birthday dinner. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I didn't realize it was a thing then. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's okay, Kylie. It's okay. Steal my blonde hair, steal my bathing suit. Everyone thinks I'm copying you. But it's okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God. Okay, everyone, back a bit, please. &gt;&gt; MAN: Back up. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Straight ahead, straight ahead. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Boy, talk about a walk. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. My water might break. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so exciting that the Givenchy show this year is in New York. He's one of mine and Kanye's, like, absolute favorite designers. You know, I think it's so great to see Kendall walk in a show. And it's been just so much fun to see her really come into her own. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; RICCARDO: Good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, like, I say this every time-- that was the best thing I've ever seen. No, seriously, like dying. &gt;&gt; KANYE: That was so dope. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was, like, the perfect lighting. &gt;&gt; RICCARDO: Aw... &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank God it didn't rain. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I like the piercings in the back. The, like, the kind of the... &gt;&gt; KIM: Everything was so amazing. &gt;&gt; RICCARDO: So, I'll see you Thursday, yeah? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, yummy. Thank you. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: You're welcome. Please enjoy! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, thank you. Cheers. &gt;&gt; COREY: I missed you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I missed you, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; COREY: Wait, wait. That's my friend. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cleaning out my dishes. &gt;&gt; COREY: But that's my friend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: On Friday night? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, in ten minutes, I'm gonna start packing for New York. Pick out my outfits. &gt;&gt; COREY: We got to celebrate! You're going on a trip. Don't meet no dudes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She could meet a dude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm not going to. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am disappointed that I didn't go to Fashion Week. But I'm really proud of Kourtney for going to New York with all of her sisters. &gt;&gt; COREY: We love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay! &gt;&gt; COREY: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; COREY: Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's so cute. &gt;&gt; COREY: I want you to pick five movies you want me to watch, and I'm gonna pick five movies I want you to watch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, but your-your movies are all, like, they star Eddie Murphy. My movies are classics. So tell me the difference. &gt;&gt; COREY: What the hell you mean? E-Eddie Murphy is classic. Boomerang? Boomerang? Gone with the Wind. How about I got to make you Dr. Zhivago, Mary Poppins? I mean, hello? Boyz n the Hood. Friday. You haven't seen... Boyz n the Hood? &gt;&gt; COREY: I want you to watch a lot of good movies that you've missed out on. You didn't have the right African-American man in your life. Look, that's gonna be us in a minute. You got to be ready, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; COREY: Romance, romance is in the air. Did you see how...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Romance is in the air? &gt;&gt; COREY: Did you see them? That's how I'm gonna be... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're rushing it. You're rushing it. &gt;&gt; COREY: And I'm gonna be pulling you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MAN: Watch out! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Even though, you know, my app is not ready and I am disappointed, I decide to still go to New York to support everybody else. I'm gonna go and do my best. Doesn't this remind you of back in the day? But when we used to come for Fashion Week, like...? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was so fun. Back in the day? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nowadays, yeah, I still see my sisters, but it's rare that we get to be out and doing, like, really fun things together. So, Kourtney, Kim and I, like, after, my dad died and, like, we started, like, doing DASH and stuff, I... we all started hanging out, like, all the time. And for some reason, we were, like, inseparable. &gt;&gt; TYGA: I used to go to Kress. That's when I first met her and Scott. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; TYGA: And then, I was, like, 16, 17, and you was coming out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, I know where... &gt;&gt; TYGA: You were so drunk. You were just, like, trippin'. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Me? &gt;&gt; TYGA: That's the first time I ever seen you, and I was just like, I was just looking like, thisis crazy. Like, you were wild and like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Great first impression. I used to fight all the time. &gt;&gt; TYGA: That's, like, the first, I still have that memory. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I used to get it, if someone, like, would touch Kim, like, just graze her-- it's a club, of course someone's gonna hit you. I would push theout of them and they would fall back. They're like, and they would, like, try to get, like, like, "What, you just hit me?" And I'm like, "Don't you dare come at me!" Like, I used to be insane. Kourtney, one time, got punched in the face! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And it was a dinner party for, like, 30 people and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then all of a sudden, Kourtney disappears. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I went to the bathroom. And I was in line. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I remember... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And this girl cut in front of me in the line. And I go, "Excuse me?" She literally... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know Kourtney's voice-- she goes, "Excuse me, you cut!" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And she literally turned around to me and just goes boom right in the face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So Kourtney... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've never been punched in the face except for that only time. It was, like, crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank God you guys were running late, because I had so much stuff to go over on my app. Like, you have no idea. And I needed to change so much stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, for our app launches, what are we all wearing? It has to be, like, united front. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And I just need to know, because I have get up at 7-7:00 a.m. and put that outfit on and wear it to work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, we're being magazine, the head person. Did they tell you that? It's, like, a big serious thing. We got to have our together. They're gonna ask you about the apps. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, we're all being Fortune? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're on a panel, like a press conference, and we're all sitting there... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mine's launching later. &gt;&gt; KIM: Could we talk about the messaging, though? Yours is just launching in December, because yours is more lifestyle. I think just say that, because it's gonna look bad, like, "It just wasn't ready." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I could say, too, I just had a baby when we were working on it... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no. So what? I'm pregnant and I have a ba... Everyone in life has a baby and they work, like, ten jobs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone in life. &gt;&gt; KIM: No excuses, like, you knew you were having this baby nine months before you did. And you knew you had this app a year ago, so there was no, to me there's no excuses. You're not special, sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, Felicia! &gt;&gt; KIM: It's already procrastinating. I need to talk to you privately. Because I've had pregnancy issues in the past, it's just easiest to have Jonathan do it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Don't give me the details. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to pee in a cup. And I just need it dropped off to the doctor. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you sick? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Tonight is my release party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, that's up. Kylie, that'sup. That's so annoying. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kylie! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm bored. &gt;&gt; KIM: These things are, like, so ridiculous. Like, I don't understand. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm in the city, so I need to pretend like we're out somewhere like... in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I haven't been here in so long. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's up? Look at thisbam-bam outfit. I love that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Since I have so much work to do on my app, we're gonna be at Jonathan's apartment for a couple hours working. "Unlock my world. Get the Kim App." &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: Should it be called "the Kim App"? Is that what we're calling it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys, it's Kim. My new app is filled with so many amazing new features that I can't wait for you to see... That lighting's good. I don't really like that close-up. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Already you're making notes? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I need to do, like, tons of these. Wait, so I need to talk to you privately. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why are you smirking? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, no, 'cause I... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why are you smirking? &gt;&gt; KIM: So because I've had, you know, pregnancy issues in the past, I need something dropped off at a lab. Can you drop one thing off for me? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, because you have Stephanie... &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I would send Stephanie, but we're, like, in such a groove getting all this content for my app. Jonathan's my best friend, and I don't know who else I would even ask to do this. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're pregnant, I know this already. That freaks me out, don't give me the details. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to pee in a cup. : And I just need it dropped off to the doctor. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you sick? What do you mean? You want me to go walk around with your piss? &gt;&gt; KIM: No one will ever know. Look, I got the cup from the doctor. And it'll be in this bag. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That is disgusting. I won't even, like, hold my own piss. Are you crazy? &gt;&gt; KIM: Almost done with my Web site, my launch is literally in two days. Let me just pee, and I'll conceal it and see if you even feel the warmth... of the pee. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: There better be no warmth and not onedot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you done yet? Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: I d... I double-bag it for you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Stick it in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here's your prescription. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's wonderful. What are you up to? &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Nothing. Also will you go get... What did you say those things are? The doughnut mixed with the... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You know. &gt;&gt; KIM: The cronuts, the cronuts-- I've never had one. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: There's no way I'm gonna make it in time. This is the masseuse. &gt;&gt; KIM: Please. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're really annoying right now. What's going on? &gt;&gt; LENNY: Um, everything good. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is Lenny the magical healer. &gt;&gt; LENNY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is Kim. Can you just set up for me? I'm gonna be right back. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: Oh, God, he seems mad. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Where's my masseuse? Where's the masseuse? &gt;&gt; KIM: You think the masseuse was able to stay? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Did you keep him? &gt;&gt; KIM: What's that chocolate on your face? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you serious? You didn't keep the masseuse? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: These are the cronuts. These are doughnuts filled with stuff 'cause I couldn't find the cronuts at first. &gt;&gt; KIM: I hate filled doughnuts. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Wait, these are cronuts? They haveall over them. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Where's the masseuse, seriously? &gt;&gt; KIM: Gone. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Where's my masseuse? I waited a month for this guy. I was in Italy dreaming about this masseuse. &gt;&gt; KIM: He had to leave. Jonathan's obviously upset. I had no idea getting cronuts would take two hours, so, you know, I feel really bad. I totallyup. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Where's my masseuse? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do not.. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Where's my masseuse? Seriously, where is the... &gt;&gt; KIM: Do not ruin my makeup. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm going to the spa. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel bad, but I have no energy to get up and chase you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God, Khloe! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Tonight is my release party for the cover I did for Galore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney's here? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney's standing... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kourtney! It's really exciting 'cause it's Fashion Week and all my sisters are here, which has never really happened before. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To be out and doing something fun and have Kourtney out on the town and then Kendall and Kylie, it's like... I'm super excited. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: This is gonna be a crazy party. It's only 11:44 right now, by the way. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; TYGA: Want to go to another club? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't leave. I never go out. I only came for you. I feel like I just got here, and for Kylie to say that she wants to leave... Kourtney is finally out, let's keep this party train going. Kylie, that'sup. Kylie, that'sup. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's kind of frustrating when my older sister is always lecturing me. I'll find you later. I'll find you later. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's so annoying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott is over at Kourtney's house... &gt;&gt; FAYE: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...with the kids. It's been a rocky road, let's just put it that way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not to, like, get into this, but I've heard from a couple people... that... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? You're scaring me. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, hi. It said it was, like, 85 degrees outside, I'm freezing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Honey, it was my last outfit, and I don't care how hot it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, no, I'm saying I have the dopest jacket. Aren't you freezing? I am. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm sweating to death. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, no, you're not. I'm freezing. You look so fab. Birth control? It's already 5:00? &gt;&gt; KIM: It can't be. Maybe it's 5:00 in L.A.? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If it was 5:00 in L.A., what time would it be here, KiKi? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's 5:00. I-I just looked at the clock. It's 5:00. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, but what time would it be here if it's 5:00 in L.A.? &gt;&gt; KIM: 8:00. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good girl. : Pregnancy brain. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I... I heard Kylie left you guys last night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, at-at the party? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think we just need to, like, have a pep talk with her and let her know we have strict rules for the show, and they don't want anyone backstage, and, like, I have to say your friends can't go backstage. I just want Kylie to have, you know, a really long-lasting career and a really good reputation. I want people to want to work with her. You can't really bring your entourage and your friends with you everywhere. And I just hope that she can learn to be responsible and respectful of everybody and understand why it's so important. I just want everyone prepared, so it's just, like, a job and so she really has to kill it, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kill it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; FAYE: Hi, sweetheart. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; FAYE: I'm good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mwah. You didn't tell me it was this muggy over here on this side of town. &gt;&gt; FAYE: By the way, that's why I was worried about your side of town, because it'd be hot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's actually nice and beautiful on my side of town, because it rained all morning. &gt;&gt; FAYE: You love your side of town, and no matter how hot or cold it is, you always say it's better there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I will get you to the dark side. &gt;&gt; FAYE:Exactly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sooner or later. All the girls are in New York. All five of them. And they had a big announcement. So here's the thing. So because all the girls are gone today, Scott is over at Kourtney's house... &gt;&gt; FAYE: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...with the kids, which isn't a bad thing... &gt;&gt; FAYE: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...'cause he's such a great dad, but it's been a rocky road, let's just put it that way. I'm proud of Kourtney because I feel like she's really trying to make a really bad situation a lot better by co-parenting with Scott. I just hope he can make a commitment and really follow through. I miss them. I miss everybody. I miss Kanye. I miss Kim. I miss Northie. &gt;&gt; FAYE: Well, I'm here this week. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's good news. You should go to this bed store with me. &gt;&gt; FAYE: Are you going to get an adjustable bed? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I'm gonna save that for when I'm, like, 85. &gt;&gt; FAYE: No, no, no, I'm telling you now, it's the greatest thing in the world. Honestly, if you're gonna be spending the amount of money that you're spending on these... this mattress, they're amazing. You can sit yourself up and sit yourself down. You can just, uh, l-lift your legs up. You can get in zero gravity. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do not have a problem lifting my legs up. &gt;&gt; FAYE: I know you don't. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MAN: Kimberly! &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you see what Mom wore last night? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I saw that. &gt;&gt; KIM: She totally tried to copy my outfit from the Givenchy show. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yo, why did she do that? &gt;&gt; KIM: A full-laced dress. She calls me and goes, "Hey, did you ever find that black velvet choker?" And I said, "No, I had to buy another one." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So this is your choker? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's, like, my full outfit. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is getting out of hand. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, she's fully stealing my clothes, trying to clone my looks when I'm gone. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So funny. So, am I still doing Kanye's show? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I was just worried that it was gonna be walking down the runway. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But thank God. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, the same thing as last time. And the clothes are so sick. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, you're gonna die. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's just funny, 'cause last year, like, even at Fashion Week last year, like, no one asked me to be at their show, and it's just funny now, 'cause I feel like everyone wants me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie is the youngest and she's getting so many calls now. She's, like, what everyone's talking about right now, and I just want her to make smart decisions. If she listens, I think she... it could be really helpful for her. I've heard from a couple people... that... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? You're scaring me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, no, it's nothing bad. Just like, that you're, like, a little bit, like... kind of a diva on set. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and I are on our way to... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kanye's show. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's Yeezy season. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: At first, I was like, "Come over whenever you want," but then that wasn't really working. &gt;&gt; MAN: Do you feel like you would want him back in your life at all? &gt;&gt; KIM: I've heard from a couple people... that... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? You're scaring me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, no, it's nothing bad. Just like, that you're, like, a little bit, like... kind of a diva on set. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm so not. &gt;&gt; KIM: But just like, you're, like, always on your phone and they have to pull you away and then... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just feel like you're kind of just, like, "Eh, I don't like this, I'll never smile." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm always nice to everybody. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I feel like, since you're, like, young and whatever, I just don't want you to have a bad rep. Like, be the wild one... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...but that's so professional and, like, "Oh, no, that's just her image. Like, yeah, that's, like, who she is, like, with her friends, but, like, you know, she's so professional," you know? Like, people love working with me 'cause I'm, like, so on time, I'm so professional, I get it done. Even if I hate it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I totally understand what Kim's saying. It's hard to hear, but I think I need to make an effort to be professional and nice to everybody, everywhere I go. I got it. Are you excited to not be pregnant? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, yeah. I'm gonna be really excited. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I heard it feels really weird when you've been pregnant for so long and then you have the baby and then you... you're not pregnant. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. It feels good as can be. Except for your stomach is a blob. It's like... rolls. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And squishy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Squishy rolls. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I took Corey, we went for a party, and I'm like, "This is that... the art I've been telling you about, Mr. Brainwash." And I said, "I want to call him, go to his studio and see what's going on over there." So here we are. But I really love your stuff. Life Is Beautiful? &gt;&gt; MR. BRAINWASH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is so good. Who'd you make that for? &gt;&gt; MR. BRAINWASH: It's... it's... it's just, I like big things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right now, Scott is visiting his kids. As much as I would love to be in New York with all my kids, I'm really glad that I could be here in L.A. and be a safety net to help check on Scott and just make sure everything's okay with him and the kids. Kourtney can relax and know that I'll handle it. She really needs to focus on the app launch. &gt;&gt; MR. BRAINWASH: So there-there is a piece that I worked a long time ago. It's all the girls. Together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! Let me see. &gt;&gt; ARTIST: Me and Thierry worked together, in collaboration. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; ARTIST: And Thierry comes to me and he says, "We have to work something on the Kardashians." &gt;&gt; KRIS: On the girls. &gt;&gt; ARTIST: And one day, you come up and he says, "Why don't we go back in time, instead of going in the future with them?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-oh. Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; COREY: That's good art. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is so crazy. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah, that looks good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look how pretty Kourtney looks. And Khloe... like, "You bitches better take the picture now, 'cause I'm not sitting here anymore." I can't believe... I gotta give you a hug for doing that. That is so amazing. You're so cute. Oh, my God. Do you have the Kanye one or no? &gt;&gt; MR. BRAINWASH: It's done long time ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All your dreams. &gt;&gt; MR. BRAINWASH: It was a old one, like 2008. There. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MR. BRAINWASH: Everything that you see is records. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just trying to think, did Kanye... is he... did he have records? &gt;&gt; COREY: CDs, man. He did make it to CDs, but he's not that old. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know, I'm, like, trying to do the math really quick in my mind. But I don't know when it switched over. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hello, hello. Hope they have our soup here. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is why I'm having you here, because I got the soup brought back on the menu just for you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; KIM: And that's why I wanted you to meet me here. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Stop playing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your favorite restaurant; I got your favorite soup brought back. I feel really bad that you left, like, so upset yesterday. I just thought about it and I was like, how annoying. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You know what? You don't come that often... &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: ...and when you do, it's like, I needed to, like, make sure that everything was great for you. So I did it. You send me to 4th... 4th Avenue, and there's no 4th Avenue in New York. &gt;&gt; KIM: Jonathan is such a good friend. I never want to upset him. I didn't even realize what I was saying and I just feel really bad and I want to do whatever I can to make it up to him. I love you and I appreciate you so much and everything that you do for me. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This speech is such a broken record. I feel like you've said this every time and you still do this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, no, I'm over it. This time, I just, like, I felt bad. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah. Why, the other times you didn't? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. The other times, it was, like, funny. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm gonna cut you soon, for doing this to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I'm so sorry. I can't bend over... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why, what happened? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...with my stomach. Can you just reach that napkin? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, yeah. Was that a test? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I really can't bend over with my stomach's in the way. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, you're right. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Hi, Mom! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Can you talk to Daddy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, you know what? I talked to him on the phone before. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: 'Kay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But tell everybody that I love them and miss them, okay? Give Masey a kiss for me. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Okay. Love you, Mommy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, love you so much. Okay, bye-bye. Was that rude, what I said? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; FRIEND: She makes me want to have a girl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But she's just, like, a sweet... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That I said I already talked to him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Probably made her happy. It's incredibly hard to... learn how to love someone and stop taking on all their baggage and their problems. And so for Kourtney to finally set some boundaries and say, "No, I need a little space, I need to grow and evolve on my own," I'm really proud of her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should I have been like, "Yeah"? &gt;&gt; FRIEND: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think she's thinking about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bible. She asked you, like, uh, literally 400 people. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Damn, you look amazing. You really are as skinny as the pics. Welcome to New York. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We've done this so many welcome to New York times, I love it. And we're still here. &gt;&gt; MAN: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kourtney and Khloe take New York. &gt;&gt; MAN: Take New York. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you two drinking? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Sake. Cheers. &gt;&gt; MAN: How's it been? Has it been weird in the house without him? You know who. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh... I don't know. It's just trying to, like, figure out just how to, like, manage life. First, I was like, "Come over whenever you want, anytime. You could have breakfast, dinner, watch them swim, play piano, like, whatever you want to do." But then that wasn't really working, so now it's like, we have, like, "This is what you need to do. You need to come when you say you're gonna come." We're trying that, so I'm trying to see how that goes. &gt;&gt; MAN: Do you feel like you would want him back in your life at all? &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Please welcome Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm excited for our panel. It's a big step for me to do this. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right, models, line up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I get nervous to do a show like this, because I'm not a model and I don't think of myself as a model. &gt;&gt; MAN: We're gonna start soon. &gt;&gt; MAN: Do you feel like you would want him back in your life at all? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not right now. Like, I don't know if there's a day when, like, Scott would get it together and be changed and someone I can depend on like a partner, but he's just not... none of those things right now. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: But are you gonna wait, like, that long? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you not gonna, like, date anybody ever again? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm not waiting. I love Scott, but I've gotten to a place where I'm just living life again. And I need to separate myself, because every time I carry his problems on my shoulders, I physically, like, can't keep doing it. Scott really needs to help himself. And I need to focus on myself. &gt;&gt; MAN: We need to get you on a date. That's the next step. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but I don't think I want to go on an actual date. &gt;&gt; MAN: I have no idea how you would meet anyone since you're, like, a shut-in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What does that mean-- that I just stay in my house? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: Did you ever chat with anyone you have any interest in? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, people, like, that try to talk... &gt;&gt; MAN: Right... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...I'll be like, "What am I gonna do with them? They're, like, seven-five and a basketball player." Dates to me are brutal. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I'll bring you straight there. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kourtney, can I get a picture? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. My friend Stacey is the designer of Alice and Olivia. &gt;&gt; STACEY: The whole theme is "Desert Goddess," so I wanted it to be, like, the inner strength of a woman. So all the looks are really kind of sexy and strong and kind of sultry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love it! &gt;&gt; STACEY: I've been having some contractions since Thursday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Probably because you're, like, doing so much. &gt;&gt; STACEY: I think this has been a lot, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; STACEY: I don't really suggest that fashion designers plan having babies during Fashion Week. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, that is insane. She's a working mom. She's having her third baby. And it's kind of amazing. &gt;&gt; STACEY: Can you say hi to Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; STACEY: Mommy has to do a couple of interviews, and then we'll go home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am always so amazed and inspired every time I hang out with Stacey, because she really balances it all. And I understand Kim's point. I need to get back to how it used to be. We went out last night to a club, and I was just like, "What are we doing?" &gt;&gt; STACEY: Yeah, but it's good for you; you need to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Please welcome Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. We're here to talk about the, uh, amazing new iOS apps. Thank you so much for joining us today. This is probably pretty unique. You're all so busy. Do you, you don't do many interviews just the five of you onstage like this? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think we ever have. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think this is the first time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm excited for our panel and to really be able to explain what our apps are going to be like. And I am happy to be here with my sisters. It's a big step for me to do this. Like, how is it different than our social media that already exists? I think it's just having that go-to place. That, like, this is my voice. This is what I want to share with the world. Any difference that we can make in a positive way, I think, is always important to us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Typically at public speaking engagements, Kourtney is the most mute. So I am super proud of her for actually having a voice today. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie loves her makeup. And Kourtney has this whole mom life that's so inspiring. And Khloe with her fitness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just feel like this is the start of a really dope-ass venture together. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and I are on our way to... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kanye's show. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kanye's show, Yeezy Season 2; it's Yeezy Season. We're running late, but what's new? &gt;&gt; MAN: Get back! Take one step back! One step back! &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie's walking in Kanye's Yeezy Season 2 fashion show. And I'm really nervous for her. You know, I think that Kanye's very specific on who he picks. I know he puts in so much work just making sure that everything's perfect. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Wait, get her nose in the shadow. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right, models, line up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I get nervous to do a show like this, because I'm not a model and I don't think of myself as a model. But it's really important for me to show Kanye I can handle this and do a good job. &gt;&gt; MAN: Anyone dressed, go to the lineup. We're gonna start soon. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MAN: We're gonna start soon. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: First row, fall in. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Fashion Week was so amazing. And it means so much to me to be in Kanye's show. And especially, the second year in a row. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good job! We're gonna say bye to Yeezus. &gt;&gt; TYGA: Okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So sick! Sorry I have to go. &gt;&gt; KANYE: It's all good. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It was so dope. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, you did so good today. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so proud of you. And you were just so dope and strong. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: See, I told... She's such a model, no one even knows-- she just blends in. She blends in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Her second year and second season in a row! Go, Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All I did was take a few steps. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But, Kylie, you do it, Kylie, you do it well. It has to be scary and intimidating up there. And I think Kylie did an awesome job. I want her momentum to continue and increase, but I want her to remain humble and incredibly grateful for every opportunity she gets. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What did you guys think of Kanye's show? Wasn't it so inspiring? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It was great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, it, like, doesn't it make you just want to dress like that every day? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Totally. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It makes you want to literally get rid of everything in your closet and just have that. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: All color. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, yeah. I just feel like this trip actually got me really excited about my app. &gt;&gt; MAN: You don't say! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so happy that I came to New York with everyone. I think if I wouldn't have come, I would've had major FOMO. And just having that sister time, like, all of us in New York City, we just haven't done this in forever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, love you guys. Bye. &gt;&gt; MAN: Love you. Safe flight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys? Everyone be real. Kendall, thanks for paying for the food. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Screw you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye, you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, love you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bitches ain't Remember that. &gt;&gt; KIM: On the next episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Good, good. That's like apainting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Boom! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I miss, like, doing stuff with Dad that, like, we used to always do, the boyish things. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: If you're upset with changes that have gone on, I want you to talk directly to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't care if you possibly could get breast cancer? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fact-- I'm going to die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to die when you're 30?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really don't care when I die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't care?
