- &gt;&gt; KRIS: A lot of people remember my ex-husband, Robert Kardashian as the attorney in the O.J. Simpson trial. Well, it's coming up on the anniversary of his death-- it's been four years, and every year we get together with the kids and the family and we go to his favorite Armenian restaurant The Carousel. Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi guys. We haven't really gone as a family in awhile, so to honor my dad, this is the best place and the best thing that we can do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob, what's your favorite memory of Daddy? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Probably, he would come in my room every night and say my prayers with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think each one of us had, like, a really different relationship with him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mine is... watching old movies. I would be like, watching the movie and get like really into it, and he would always like... he would never record the ending. &gt;&gt; KIM: His recording skills were not so good. Every morning when he would come in, I would be either drinking hot tea-- 'cause he'd always drink tea-- and I'd put sugar in it. He'd always come in and be like, "Would you like some hot chocolate with your sugar?" Or, "Would you like some tea with your honey?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A couple weeks before he died, he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. My sisters and my brother have dealt with it. I get very angry or just very quiet, very distant towards my family. &gt;&gt; ROBERT KARDASHIAN: Okay, here's Khloe. Ooh, good one. : I love, you, I love you, I love you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I try to never talk about my dad or him passing away. I can talk about him and happy moments, but not him being sick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All of us have a hard time every year at this time, but I think Khloe especially takes it really really hard. I don't think she's really dealt with all the anger and the grief that she has inside. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so someone will pick it up tomorrow. Do you have all my credit card info? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Jesus... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, yeah, okay... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, can someone help me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, good, so you have it it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm really tired of doing all this... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm buying something on the phone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just going through all the stuff that people send. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're just going through stuff people send to you? Is it for the store or for you? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, they sent it to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So shouldn't you be doing that at your house? I like, I cannot clean up after you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to give people my home address. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So take it home. Like, I cannot clean up after you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Relax. I'm going to go through this and I'm giving you guys some stuff, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't give a I cannot handle it. I'm stressed out. I'm breaking out because I cannot work this much all the time. It... Get theout of here. Go toSmooch. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get theout of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, psycho. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get theout. &gt;&gt; KIM: What a freak. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to clean up here-- I don't want to be here allday. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh... Khloe. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you okay? Do you need to go to anger management... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm not okay. I need aXanax, I need something. This is No onehelps me. I'm notokay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe better get her act together or something really bad is going to happen to her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would love to see you guys clean up and do this on your own. Bye, bitches. Have a great time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe needs to be put away for a few months. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm really tired of arguing with Kourtney and Kim. So we're going to go party and release some steam. And I'm going to turn into an alcoholic tonight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe is so bipolar. She's screaming at me one second, making a joke the next. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is so nice not to be arguing with my sisters. It's great just to be out and having fun. But I'm so tired, I just want to go home. I'm halfway home, and all of a sudden I'm really buzzed. I see a cop car behind me. The lights go on, and all I am thinking is "a duck." &gt;&gt; You have anything to drink tonight? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; How much? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: About four drinks. &gt;&gt; Four drinks? Do me a favor, step out of the car. Okay, I'm going to do a series of tests with you, okay? It's called a field sobriety test. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; All right, put your right foot out in front of you. Put your hands at your side. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's skip that one, okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I cannot stand on both of my feet, let alone one. I'm doing horrible, and I know I'm going to go to jail. I could just feel it. &gt;&gt; Okay, the last part of the test-- I want you to turn around, put your hands behind your head. Interlace your fingers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This isn't a test. &gt;&gt; This is the last step of the test, okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh,a duck. I am soright now. I totally know I should not have been driving. So irresponsible. My mom's going to kill me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, it's Khloe. Don't hang up. I'm calling you from jail. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm in jail. I have a DUI. I have to stay in here for seven hours at maximum. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm okay. I'm just... I mean, I look like a whore. I'm in like a mini dress, so... it's kind of embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, I feel so bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Please come get me. I cannot call you again, okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sorry to put you through this. Don't tell Mom. Don't tell Kim. Just don't tell anybody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, wake up. Khloe's in jail. She got a DUI. She told me not even to tell you, so just don't do anything. Don't tell Mom, and do not tell Bruce. Just go to sleep. I'm just telling you. Just go to sleep. There's nothing we can do. She's getting out at noon. One of us just has to be there to pick her up from the jail. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, at this hour, there's nothing, really, that Kourtney and I can do. I just have to go to sleep and wait till Khloe's out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Morning. Hi, kiddo. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just checking, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? Where's Khloe? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't know where Khloe is? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wasn't she supposed to open this morning? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but I'm taking over-- she needed a break. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. I think it's so weird, for some reason, that Khloe isn't here. I'm really... She never not comes in and opens the store. She hasn't called you? I'm having lunch with Kim, and I see that she's really, really nervous. And I keep seeing her getting her pages and her phone calls from her sisters, and I <i>know</i> something's wrong. Well, it's kind of weird because, usually, she calls me three or four times and asks me if I want a coffee every damn morning before I even get to work. And I haven't heard from her, which is odd. What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not funny, but Khloe's in jail. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! What do you mean, Khloe's in jail? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, Mom. Relax. Khloe got pulled over last night for a DUI. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A DUI? I've been asking you all morning where the hell is Khloe, and you tell me now, three hours later? Why aren't <i>you</i> at jail with her right now if you know she's in jail? What's wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney told me that she took care of it, and I just called her, and she... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney took care of it, yet my daughter is in jail! I am shocked, freaked out, disappointed, and all I could think about is getting to wherever Khloe is. I can't believe you guys. If something had happened to one of you, and I wasn't there immediately, you guys... Hi. Robert Shapiro, please. Kris Jenner. Kit, tell him to call me. It's urgent. Here is their sister in jail, and they know it, and why are they sitting here when they should be at the jailhouse trying to get her out and released? Okay, I should have been the next call. Then we get Robert on it, and it's done, okay? You don't leave somebody in jail. And I should have been your first call at 5:30 this morning. I blame you, Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: You're blaming me? Why don't you blame your alcoholic daughters? Don't blame me. I'm the only one that doesn't drink. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so not you, Khloe. I never thought I'd be picking you up from thejail. How are we going to tell Bruce? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not telling Bruce a thing! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel really, really sad that Khloe has been in this jail cell all night long, but I am shocked, disappointed, angry all at the same time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so ready to go home, and who shows up to pick me up? My mom. Kill me now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You okay? Oh, baby. You okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? Come on. The good news is you're okay. The bad news is I'm pissed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! I can't deal with this. I'm sotired. I've been in jail for 19 hours. I can't deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm tired, too. Do you need some water? Did they give you anything in there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. It's poisonous in there. I'm not touching a thing. I really thought I was fine to drive. Once I got in the car, I realized I wasn't that cool. But Kourtney was more drunk than I was, and everybody left me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you feel like you've had a little too much to drink, Khloe, why didn't you call me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I didn't realize... I didn't realize! &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, Khloe. Well, this is just freaking me out! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a accident! &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are we going to tell Bruce? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not telling Bruce a thing! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do not tell him either. Let's wait. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just got a DUI, and you don't think he's going to find out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, like Kim hasn't done worse things than me, and you guys didn't tell him, so let's not even go there, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: To get in a car, and potentially hurt the lives of somebody else, and changing somebody else's whole life forever... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get it. This is not the right time. I have not eaten. I haven't even gone to the bathroom. Leave me alone right now! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't leave you alone, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been in jail sitting there thinking about it. My point is, I'm mad at Kourtney for telling you guys, one. And two, Bruce is not knowing a thing. I look like a nightmare. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, don't get into that with me. We're going to come back... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. What... Don't get into what with me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to come back, and we're going to have a little talk, and you gotta start thinking about what your dad would say about this right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so heartless that she's bringing this up right now. She knows that it's going to with my head. My dad is not here. I don't understand why she needs to bring him up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt? If it wasn't for Kourtney, no one would even know about my DUI. Where thewere you?! I've been in jail waiting for you! You told Mom on me. Mom's going to tell Bruce. Like, I can't deal with this right now, seriously. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I did not tell Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So who the told Mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim told Mom, and I told Kim, and I told Kim, "Do not tell Mom and do not tell Bruce." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's just typical. I just don't get it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't blame me for your own problems. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't care that you told Kim, but I specifically called <i>you,</i> and I told <i>you</i> to come and get me. Me getting out of jail is the firstthing. I don't want to see Mom yelling at me! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is your own fault. You're the one who's drinking and driving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was with you guys! And you guys left! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you want from me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't deal at the moment. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really, I can't breathe. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, really serious. Like, this happened obviously for a reason. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The only thing I can say out of all of this is that you learn a lesson. And I think that's what you have to say to Bruce. You know what, Khloe? The way I feel is any time you have secrets that you have to keep from somebody, it's stressful. Then you have to think of lies to cover the lies to cover the lies, and it just not worth it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I'm sure he'll be upset, but he's not gonna judge you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We encouraged Khloe to just go get Bruce and let's just tell him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom and I need to talk to you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Talk? Boy, here we go. What is it now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think Khloe's really, really nervous to even say the words out loud to Bruce because she knows that this is really gonna disappoint him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got a DUI. I already have... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is the first I've heard about it? I mean, that's really stupid, you know? Really stupid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really wasn't that drunk. It wasn't a high percentage. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, this is really hard for her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Remember, my brother was killed in a car accident. Killed, dead, gone. 18 years old, fooling around in a car. Look at all the bull you go through 'cause you're out drinking. If your dad was still around... &gt;&gt; ROBERT: People drinking and driving kill themselves, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: Forget about yourself. Kill yourself, that's fine. It's selfish of you to go and harm other people. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Congratulations, Khloe. You're the first one in the family to get a DWI. Way to go, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe was such a psychopath. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's crazy. I feel like she's gonna murder me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe was such a psychopath. She is, like, a loose cannon ready to explode at any moment. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like she's crazy. Like, she scares me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, you just don't know what she's gonna do. Like, she'll just, like, has this rage inside. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, I'm afraid for her. Like, the guys that she dates, she probably beats them up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Chains them down to the bed and, like, dances all over them... with an ax. Then just chops their off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We've just been fighting so much lately, and I don't really understand what I've done, or I don't really understand, like, just everyone is fighting. I don't understand why and it's really pissing me off because I'm always the one who has to say "I'm sorry." We normally fight and have, like, some reason why we're fighting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. You know what I think, Khloe? I think that also it has something to do with the time of year, and it seems like every year rolls around and it's the anniversary of Daddy's death, and I think everybody doesn't know how to deal with their grief, so you guys all get-- including myself-- really angry. I think there's a lot of unspoken grief, and the only way we know how to deal with it is sometimes turn that into anger. And we lash out at the people we love the most because we're the only ones who understand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If we're fighting, I just think I should be the one to do what my dad would have done and smooth things over. My dad in our family was the rock, was the backbone of all of us. I would hope my family would consider me a rock or a strong person in their life. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe really has, like, anger-management issues. Like, she really, really, really does. It's really crazy. I feel like she's gonna murder me. Well? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We've all been fighting a lot lately, and I just don't think that's cool. I understand that we're gonna fight 'cause we do so much stuff together, but I got you guys a little gift because I felt a little bad-- for you both. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh... Oh, Khloe, I love this. It looks just like the music note that was on Dad's keychain. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: My dad was so into music and, you know, was in the music business, so his keychain, like everything of my dad's, was always a music note. This is so cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like an apology present 'cause I know I was a little out of line and crazy, but it's also like we wear them every day. It's like a friendship thing; a sisterly thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I admit that I don't know how to deal with my dad's death as of now, but I will find a way to cope with it and overcome it. Hug me, you fool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I missed you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you looking at? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm trying to find, like, a DVD or something. Just, like, a cute home movie we can watch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, I want to watch home movies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Every moment of our lives he would, you know videotape us as kids, and he was narrating all of that. &gt;&gt; ROBERT KARDASHIAN: Let's see, can you girls speak Armenian? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We do not know any Armenian. Oh, my God, I fell out of the bathtub. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We pushed you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have no clothes on! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's new? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Things haven't changed. &gt;&gt; ROBERT KARDASHIAN: Okay, here's Khloe, and this is your first day of school. Are you excited? Let me see your lunchbox. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that Kourt? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's Kim. Look at her posing. Look at Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: He, like, zooms in on my face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at Mom. Let me have her bathrobe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at her glasses. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my gosh, I can't believe you're watching this. Oh, you guys are so cute! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I believe all of our blessings that we have now are because we have a guardian angel which is my dad by our sides. &gt;&gt; ROBERT KARDASHIAN: There's Kourtney and Robert and Khloe. There we have all four of you. How beautiful. ♫ Incredibly passionate Incredible you You always knew what to say. ♫ &gt;&gt; ROBERT KARDASHIAN: Hey, who are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bob! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; ROBERT KARDASHIAN: What's your name? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Robert Kardashian. &gt;&gt; ROBERT KARDASHIAN: That is right. Are you going to school today? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yes! &gt;&gt; ROBERT KARDASHIAN: You are? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, he's not. &gt;&gt; ROBERT KARDASHIAN: Oh, look, my daughter! &gt;&gt; KIM: No fair! Stop! &gt;&gt; KIM: Still to come this season on <i>Keeping Up With The</i> <i>Kardashians:</i> I just want to set the record straight. &gt;&gt; RYAN: What's the story with Reggie Bush and Kim Kardashian? How about fabulous? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so pregnant, dude. &gt;&gt; KIM: The party bus is here! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're trying to say that you're getting married? &gt;&gt; KIM: There's a homeless man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do we do? We borrowed some of your clothes. We gave him a bath. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm a guardian angel. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's been a little situation. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to talk to Kourtney! Guess what's come back to haunt us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My sex pictures? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney's in the office with the FBI. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone's just gonna think I'm such a whore!
