- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So who likes my bangs? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are bangin'. Get it? Bangin'? I love myself. Khloe, I love this ring. Can I have it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but you can borrow &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love it. I want to wear it today. When are you ever going to ever have have a ring on that finger? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, there you go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I often think about Khloe and I wonder if she's lonely on the inside. And I kind of wonder, "When is Khloe going to meet somebody?" Are you ever going to be engaged? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't they get engaged? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I feel like you You don't date. You don't date. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do date, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're like a &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're like a workaholic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom always points out to me that when she was my age, she had kids and she was married. I'm young, I'm having fun. Leave me alone. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just feel bad 'cause like, this is the first time when like, I have a boyfriend, Kourt has a boyfriend, Rob has a girlfriend, and you're like the only one out of all of us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like when we all hang out, like, all go bowling, it's like the three couples... and you. &gt;&gt; KIM: And you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If it bothers you guys so much, I won't go with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe loves to be by herself. She loves to just have no one that she has to answer to. And I get that, but how could you not want to spend your days with someone that you love, that you can share everything with? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They want you to have, like, a partner in your life where you're happy and in love. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have partners. No. I'm so happy the way I am right now, and if you guys can't respect that, then go away. I don't really care. Alright, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KIM: Breakfast was nice this morning. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I don't know, I just kind of feel bad that Khloe like, is left out. Obviously, she hasn't found the right person if she... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe I just feel that she doesn't want to. &gt;&gt; KIM: It can't be that she just doesn't want to meet someone. And I think that she just obviously hasn't found the right person and is meeting all these losers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We should include Malika into this convo-- her best friend that knows her secret dating habits. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: See, the thing is I think Khloe's still just experimenting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but I don't know, I just think that we should totally like, set Khloe up on a Web site where you meet people. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, are you joking? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's the worst. &gt;&gt; KIM: How funny would it be to set up Khloe on an Internet dating Web site? Khloe hasn't really met anyone yet. So why not, you know, force the situation? We don't have to tell her. Let's just do it and see... like, let's write what we think... Oh, my God, you have to help us. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Just say I did not know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then what if somebody like, Perez, puts it on the front of his page-- "Khloe Kardashian." &gt;&gt; KIM: Who cares? Let's just set up a Web site for her. Come on, we're doing this. Let's go to Smooch, so... in case she comes back, we're not on the computer doing it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you for real? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, let's go. Who cares? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. Khloe would absolutely kill us if she found out we were doing this, but whatever. We need to get her some help. Khloe is going to kill us. &gt;&gt; KIM: No she won't. Okay, "I consider my looks-- attractive, very attractive, extremely... stunningly attractive." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe considers hers stunningly attractive. &gt;&gt; KIM: "He should have completed..." I think college. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My boyfriend Scott didn't go to college. "I'm happy if he is..." &gt;&gt; KIM: Christian, he can only be Christian. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's a Jew. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Do you smoke?" Never. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He should smoke never. We have everything on here that I would say Scott does. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we set Khloe up with a profile, and it's so fun, and Kourtney's kind of getting into it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "About me" and "who I'd like." &gt;&gt; KIM: You never know; her Prince Charming could be waiting there, and she would have missed the boat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So let's just check it tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Mommy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Keny. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Can I have $50? &gt;&gt; KRIS: $50? For what? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: There's these new shoes at the mall that I really want. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't need any more shoes. What kind of shoes are they? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: They're like clear. They're really cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're clear? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'd go ask Daddy. I can be such a pushover when it comes to money. So I'm going to let Bruce take care of this one, because he loves teaching the girls life lessons about money. Kendal, you have to think about what you're asking for, because money doesn't grow on trees. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Yes, it does-- it's paper. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Hey, Daddy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, buddy. What's up? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Can I have $50? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 50 bucks? You know, I have no problem with giving my kids an allowance, but on the other hand, they got to do something for it. I don't just give money away. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: I'm going with my friends to the mall. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'll tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. Let's set up a little thing for you... to earn the money. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: What is it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, walking the dog-- how much is that worth? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Um, we used to get like $5. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Make it $10. I'm feeling generous. Washing the car? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: That's $20. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Interior-- an additional $10. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Okay, car... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ten bucks a day for keeping your room clean. So we can start adding all that sort of stuff up, and I think probably pretty quickly you could earn your 50 bucks. Kendal has lived a very good life her whole life. And it's time that she learns that the party's over with, and that she's going to have to work. Good luck. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, where are you? Are you in the back? Hey, Kourt, have you checked Khloe's Web site? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. No. I just walked in. Do you want to check it? &gt;&gt; KIM: We have to check it. Oh, my God, she has 58 new winks. We checked back the next day, and she has like 58 winks, meaning that they think she's cute. They write her a little message. It's like basically a little e-mail. What are we going to say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, this guy sent his phone number. We need to call. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you going to say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, is Justin there? &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: Speaking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, this is Kourtney, and I'm Khloe's sister who we made a profile for. &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: Sure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So we wanted to set you up on a secret date with Khloe. &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: Oh, okay, great, great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney and I call a few people that we think would be really good matches for Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you do? &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: I just work at home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Doing what? &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: I do computer sales. &gt;&gt; KIM: But we realize that a few of them really just are the biggest losers and no one she would ever consider wasting her time on. &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: Well, I'm available. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sure you are. &gt;&gt; Hello, you've reached James and Bill. We're not available right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: James is gay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: James is gay. &gt;&gt; Yello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. We're not talking to anybody that says... "Yello." &gt;&gt; KIM: "Yello." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would say 99.9% of the guys on this Web site are not it at all for Khloe. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Is Nick there? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: No. Who's this? &gt;&gt;KOURTNEY: But I think there's a couple of potential guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We wanted to see if we could set up a little date with Khloe, but something casual, like maybe just go for coffee or something. &gt;&gt; MAN: Absolutely. Casual is, uh, better for me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks, Vince, baby. &gt;&gt; VINCE: All right, thanks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So we set up a series of five-minute speed dates for Khloe, and now we just have to tell her. I don't think she's gonna like it. Okay. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Kabana! Ugh. Hi, Angel. Wow, that's a lot of dogs! How much do you charge? Are you serious? Can you walk my dog? &gt;&gt; ANGEL: Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Angel works for some of our neighbors. He's only charging me five dollars. My dad's paying me ten, so I still make five bucks on this deal. How long will you be walking her for? &gt;&gt; ANGEL: I walk, like, for, like, an hour. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: You're gonna take good care of her, right? &gt;&gt; ANGEL: Oh, yes. Very good care. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Okay. Here you go. &gt;&gt; ANGEL: Thank you. We'll see you in a little bit. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Okay. Ah, this is so nice. I could sit back, relax and still get paid. &gt;&gt; ANGEL: Good dog, sweetie. Come on, sweetie. &gt;&gt; KIM: We brought you a drink. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks. Did you poison it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We put Splenda just for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you guys being so weird? Especially you-- you're way too nice to me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim did something that she needs to tell you about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have to Bible you won't get mad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What thedid you guys do? Kourt, this is, like, bull... I'm so over this Can we finish? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim did something that she needs to tell you about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have to Bible that you won't get mad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What thedid you guys do? &gt;&gt; KIM: You have to say Bible. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have to Bible it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I Bible that I won't <i>stay mad, but I'm not gonna</i> Bible... 'Cause I don't know what you guys did. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, fair enough. We, um, thought it would be funny-- it's just funny, so have a sense of humor, 'cause you're the funny one, you know? We set you up an account on, uh, like, one of those dating service dot-coms. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! Why would you do that? I don't think it's fair that people are forcing something down my throat. They really need to back off. What was the purpose of you guys doing this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is a hopeless romantic. Kim's all about thinking that we're going to be planning your wedding next year from this dating service. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, when can you ever say in your life that you got set up online, and, like, this is safe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, did you just say this is safe? &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause we're going. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kimberly, you couldn't protect me from a damn spider. Okay? You're terrified. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY:<i>Icould.</i> &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have, like, a high kicking radius. &gt;&gt; KIM: And, Khloe, we're going to, like, an open place. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you expect those people to say? I'm not that naive. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just give me a little shake that you're gonna do it, and let's carry on with our day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just want to know... &gt;&gt; KIM: Just touch my hand; I need it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, what have you got to lose? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My dignity and pride! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If I grab your boob, that means you're doing &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fine, Kourtney, I'll do it! I'll do it! Okay, I'll do it! I'm gonna go and do this for them. But seriously, after all these dates, they really need to back off. Ooh, baby, I like it! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe! &gt;&gt; ANGEL: Okay, here's Kabana. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Hi. Thank you. Here's your money. &gt;&gt; ANGEL: Okay, thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Wait. Do you do anything else besides walk dogs? &gt;&gt; ANGEL: Yes. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Come in. The guy that I hired to walk Kabana, he also does dishes, washes cars. We can do my bedroom now. How about another five dollars? I'm gonna hire him to do all my chores at a lower rate. You're done? Um, here's your money. But you're still coming back tomorrow, right, for walking Kabana? Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; ANGEL: Okay. See you. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't believe you guys are making me do this. Kourt and Kim set me up on all these Internet dates, kind of a form of speed dating. &gt;&gt; KIM: So you keep this in your bag-- it's a baby monitor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and Kim will be sitting in my car, spying on me with electronics so they can hear what's going on, technically, be on my date with &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Then, Kim and I each have binoculars, so we are gonna be watching. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are people gonna know who I am? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because I told them you're wearing a plaid jacket. That's why I picked it out for you this morning, be-yatch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Over and out. Enjoy yourself, be-yatch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Date number one on the way. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, what's up? Are you Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: How are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. What's your name? &gt;&gt; MAN: Justin. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Justin? &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: Nice to meet you as well. &gt;&gt; KIM: He kind of has rabbit teeth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tell<i>me something</i> interesting. &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: Tell you something interesting. Um, I realize when you go to pool parties, there's a huge difference if you pee<i>into a</i> pool or <i>pee in a pool.</i> &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, what? &gt;&gt; MAN: Hi. Are you Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: I'm James. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, James. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; JAMES: Nice meeting you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have kids? &gt;&gt; JAMES: All I really have right now is a turtle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you saw the pic, he looks nothing like what he looks like. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a rat trap for them hos, for them rats? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, for them hos. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MAN: So, you're on this Web site, eh? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My sisters put me on. Why are you on it? &gt;&gt; MAN: Just to, I don't know, hump some chicks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hump some chicks? Do you have girls that you're dating right now? &gt;&gt; JUSTIN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How many? Are you, like, some kind of weird freak? &gt;&gt; MAN: So, are you really Kim Kardashian's sister? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; MAN: Does she really have butt implants? &gt;&gt; KIM: Get out of here with your butt implant question! Get out! &gt;&gt; MAN: Did I ruin it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right. Nice meeting you. Sorry. : Ugh! Kourt, this is, like, bull I'm so over this &gt;&gt; KIM: One more date and you're done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I'm done <i>now.</i> Okay, I've done it Kim and Kourtney's way, but now they really have to stop. Kourtney, swear to God I can't do anymore. It's &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on with Khloe? &gt;&gt; KIM: She's upstairs in her room, and she does not want to come out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There was one guy that I think she secretly... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop talking so much &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The date sucked ass. I never want to go on another setup date again. And I hope Kourtney and Kim leave me alone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, what's going on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I came to find out what's going on with Khloe. How were the dates? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Oh, my God" what? What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: They were so funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where is she? &gt;&gt; KIM: She's upstairs in her room, and she does not want to come out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So is she mad at you guys? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. I think so. Khloe's definitely mad at us. We get home and she completely just locks herself up in the room. We overstepped our boundaries a little bit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You feel bad because she doesn't have a significant other, you know? I think she feels bad that she doesn't have a significant other. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, she's also, what, 23 years old. It's fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When I was 23 years old, I had a baby already. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendal, I'm going for a bike ride. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, Bella! &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Daddy, no! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll be back. Okay. I'll be back in a little bit. Love you. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: That was gross, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Hi, Angel. I was thinking we could do the car today. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Ooh! Okay, I think we should do that window, 'cause Kabana, she has muddy feet, so we want to clean that I'll be in my room. Come on, puppy, come here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Angel? I walk in and see Angel, the guy who walks the dogs for everybody in the neighborhood, inside my house... cleaning windows. &gt;&gt; Kendal hired me to do some things. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendal? My daughter Kendal? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is she paying you? &gt;&gt; Yes, she pay me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No way. &gt;&gt; Yeah, she did. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Keep going. Kendal has contracted out her jobs to Angel. Nice guy, but he's not supposed to be doing 'em. I gotta get to the bottom of this. Hey, buddy. Good job. The car looks great. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. Nice and clean. The dog looks happy. You walk the dog? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Uh-huh, and I did the dishes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You did the dishes, too! That's great. All by yourself? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Yep. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? So how much do I owe you? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: $50. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I got $20, $20, $40, 50 bucks. Here you go. Good job. Job well done. I can't believe it. I think she's trying to pull one over on me. These kids, you gotta watch 'em. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No... 'cause I want to know what's going on before you get this 50 bucks. Angel is out there doing your work. Why is Angel doing it? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: I hired him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You hired him? Really? Now, wasn't the assignment for <i>you to make the money?</i> That means<i>youhave to work?</i> I appreciate your entreprenurial skills, but you know what? I don't think I deserve to give you this money, 'cause you didn't do the work. But the thing is, it's not fair that you stick this guy for 20 bucks so you're gonna have to give him the $20. Kendal has to realize to get paid, she's gonna have to do the work, not her, you know, her employee. She's really gonna have to go to work now. I think this is gonna be fun. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Ew! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you get it? I'll tell you what, Kendal. I'll give you an extra quarter for each piece of poop you pick &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Ew! No shoes in the world are worth picking up poop for. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go on. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: I can't believe my dad's making me do this. Next time I want something, I'll just ask one of my sisters. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do it yourself next time, you get all the money. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: I get it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Meka. &gt;&gt; What's going on, baby? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and Kim are soannoying. <i>Oh God, what did they do now?</i> &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Noth... I mean, remember I told you they were, like, making me go on those desperate online speed dating ? &gt;&gt; Yes. Hilarious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, so I just left from there, and it's like they're just, like, nagging me about this dating crap, and, like, I did it. I did what you wanted, and they just keep on nagging me. &gt;&gt; Um, I think they really just want to see you shackled. That's so big-sister things for them to do. But you gotta do it in your own way, though, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you're right. Oh! I hate them sometimes. I've done things Kim and Kourtney's way, but now I'm gonna do it my way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Was she into anybody? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There was one guy that I think she secretly is into, but... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop talking so much , guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look who showed up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not here for long. I just came to tell you guys I actually am going on a date with one of these guys. &gt;&gt; BOTH: Who? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tonight? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, in a little bit. I gotta go get ready. Ta-ta! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tonight's the night! Our plan obviously worked. So Kim and I will just step away and let her do her thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I cannot believe she's going on a date. We never know. This could be, like, the love of her life, and she could fall deeply in love with someone that we set her up with. Then she'll owe us for the rest of her life. &gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. I have reservations under Khloe Kardashian. &gt;&gt; Your party's already here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, good, perfect. &gt;&gt; Right this way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I guess I lied. I'm really not going on a date with one of my speed daters. I am actually on a date with my two best friends Malika and Khadijah. Kourt and Kim will not get off my case, so I decided to lie to 'em. Best policy. For many, many more dates just like this one. &gt;&gt; BOTH: Yay! I really do not think a man defines you, or a date. I just think as long as you're happy within yourself, you're happy. I'm not gonna be single forever. I'm young. I need a toast. I just want to enjoy my life right now. I just want to be single. Whoo! Next time on <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>with the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; He's an amazing photographer. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You know, I'm doing the modeling thing. I decided I'm going to go to Tokyo, Japan. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's crazy, irresponsible and stupid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is crazy. What happened in here? Some really creepy guy is trying to vandalize the store. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want all the doors locked cos this is dangerous.
