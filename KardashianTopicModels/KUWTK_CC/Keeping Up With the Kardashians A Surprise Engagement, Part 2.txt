- Previously on... Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So Mom called me and said Kanye wants us all in San Fran for Kim's birthday. We can't say a word. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom has asked Khloe and I to invite Kim's close friends and family members, but we just need to make sure that these people do not ruin the surprise. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like it's something maje. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I invited Larsa, Malika and Khadijah. I'm gonna call Chaunch. &gt;&gt; CICI: Hey, what do you got? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. We're, uh, talking about San Fran. Are you excited? &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, my God, I wasn't supposed to saying anything! I'm going! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you think is happening? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Donna Chang is meeting us there. We don't know what is happening. &gt;&gt; CICI: Okay, me neither. Your mother just said, um... &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you guys talking about? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. I cannot believe Kim just walked through this door. I have no idea how much she heard of our conversation. We were just talking about Scott's mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie, you look so cute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KIM: I like that outfit. Can I borrow it after? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Holy, that was close. Thank God Kim is completely clueless. I mean, if we blow this for Kanye, we're really gonna be annihilated. Here, I have a friendship bracelet for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You do? Yay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't say you lost it. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Kanye wants to spend my birthday in San Fran. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's in San Fran? &gt;&gt; KIM: No idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The concert, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: The next day. It's, like, so much flying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You only live once. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: YOLO. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but I don't want to leave, like, North for that long, you know? &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay... 39 00:01:46,395 --> 00:01:49,631 if you say so. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is what Kim said that Kendall made. So good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, look-it, Penny's toppers. It's all Penelope. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can we see Penny's toppers? &gt;&gt; KIM: What, you've never seen it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah, he's so little. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So cute. Look at that... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, how's your mom today? I called your dad, but he didn't answer. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He said she wasn't too responsive. Just kind of... nothing good, nothing bad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Recently, Scott's mom has been having some health problems. Everything just seems really uncertain. Did the doctors say anything? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, the doctors never say anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's an only child, so his mom means the world to him. &gt;&gt; BONNIE: What's a cow do? &gt;&gt; MASON: Moo. &gt;&gt; BONNIE: Moo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's so lovable and sweet. &gt;&gt; BONNIE: What a nice kiss. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's just handling it the best that he can. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What happened with your mom? I haven't talked to anybody. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, she's okay. I mean, she's in the hospital. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How's she doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's in ICU. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, she's in ICU. It's not like she's free and clear, but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...we're hoping for the best. My dad's there every day. For a long time, my father has been sick and just out of shape. And he's been a diabetic since he's 12 years old. And, you know, I kind of always knew that my father wasn't gonna live terribly old. So it's a really huge shocker to me to find out that my mom is sick. It almost doesn't feel real, because never once did I hear anything about my mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Was her liver wasn't working? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Her liver shut down, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is it working? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's not working. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, she'd have to get better, and then get a liver transplant. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So she's on... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But luckily, we're hoping that... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...a liver machine? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...she has no brain damage... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...because of everything that happened with the no oxygen and all this, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: Was she just not feeling good one day? Like, how did it, like, happen where they took her to the hospital? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was basically it. She had to go to the emergency room, and then before you know it, she kind of just stopped responding and had to get on, like, a respirator and was in ICU. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She was in a coma. Now she's coming out of it, and she opens her eyes, but she doesn't talk. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, as of now, the MRIs and stuff are showing pretty decent signs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It doesn't look like there's any strokes or anything, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: I wonder, when she gets better, if you can ask her, like, "What do you remember when you're...?" 101 00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:22,796 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I hope that it comes to that, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's Rob! Yay! So we'll be ready to take off soon. I can't believe that with the four-day warning, I got everybody to come up to San Francisco to celebrate something so special that most of us don't even know about, except for me and Kanye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Going to see Kimmy! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You brought your real camera? The one challenge in today's day and age with social media is trying to keep everybody on a lockdown, which means getting a private plane so nobody sees us in an airport, getting blacked-out SUVs so nobody sees us in cars, and making sure that nobody tweets or Instagrams something out there that shouldn't be there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you excited? Like, I don't even know if I should be excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We should be ready to have an amazing, unique evening that is going to be fantastic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But what does "unique" mean? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How's P? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's fine. She's still wobbling around like she's drunk. It's so hard for me to let loose and have fun when my mind is totally in a different place. I'm more than willing to go to New York and be with Scott, but he really wants to be alone with his parents. So until he really wants me to come, I just keep offering. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My dad's at the hospital. He's there every day for the past three weeks. You know him; like, he's already not in good shape and, you know, he hasn't been on his own ever, you know what I mean? Like, she's been taking care of him for 40 years. With my mom in intensive care, I made the decision not to go to Kim's surprise party in San Francisco. And, you know, I'd love to be there. I'm sure I will miss out on something that's unforgettable. I don't mind the traveling. I just don't want something bad to happen and me not be here, you know? Going back and forth, it's not easy when my family's on the East Coast and I live on the West Coast, but I feel like my mom needs me more than ever. Yeah, so I'm gonna go stop at the hospital, try to say hi and talk to her even though, you know, she can't really understand. So it's just hard. Right now, I just need to worry about my mom and dad and be present for them. &gt;&gt; ALL: Happy birthday, Kim! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I wonder what this is going to be like. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The only information which I got was that it was black tie. Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So what's happening? Is Obama coming? &gt;&gt; KRIS: God, I hope so. Actually, he said to me he has big surprises for us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. I'm in the dark. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You totally know. I know my mom knows way more than she's letting on. And that's okay. I want to be surprised. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, like, I think he just wants to have a fun night for Kim's birthday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But, you guys, he wants another baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What if it's a surprise wedding? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We cannot project what's gonna happen tonight, and I think we need to relax and enjoy the moment. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, thank you. 163 00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:55,327 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kat, are you here in San Francisco? &gt;&gt; KAT: Yeah, so I'm really excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, awesome. &gt;&gt; KAT: Do you have both dresses with you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I have the Valentino, the McQueen and the Alaia. &gt;&gt; KAT: Oh, my God. I can't wait. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's for sure. Tonight is going to be so exciting. And after they find out what's really going on, it's gonna mean even more. This is gonna be the most amazing night. I'm so happy. I know firsthand the real Kanye. He is a sweetheart with a huge heart for everyone that he loves. He's so many things that I don't think a lot of people really get a chance to see. He's the best guy to my daughter, and really has her best interests at heart. &gt;&gt; KAT: Great. Well, I will see you shortly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, great. We're on our way. &gt;&gt; ROB: ♫ I said yee-ha, yee-ha, ah-ha-ha-ha... ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ♫ Oh, yee-ha! Ah... ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ♫ Yee-ha... ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: ♫ Yee-ha! ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, you have such a loud voice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And deep. &gt;&gt; DRIVER: The San Francisco Opera is doing auditions tonight. &gt;&gt; ROB: Are they? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should do it. &gt;&gt; ROB: I was gonna say, put me in a Holiday Inn and let me find out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? 194 00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:33,099 Hey. How you doing? Good. We don't even know what we're doing here; it's a surprise. Ceda's gonna meet you... Listen. Ceda... Li... stop. Okay, I have to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who is that? Who? Lamar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Everyone, Lam says he loves you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Love you, mean it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I don't want to hang up on you, but I have to go. Okay, bye. Even though we're all going to do something really exciting and fun, there's just so much going on, there's such highs and such lows. We're so happy and we want to be in this moment, but it's also hard. It's just crazy how life works. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo, somebody wrote on Instagram, "Khloe is all sex appeal lately, love it. Own thissituation you're in." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, thank God, to me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, wait, these girls are trying to take a picture of us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one can know that we're here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My mom is making it pretty intense that we don't ruin the surprise. This is so scary. Oh, everyone's noticing us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, relax. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. 220 00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,614 Oh, my... I didn't mean to do that, I swear. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What kind of hamburger did you have at the hospital? &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: Nice little cheeseburger, lettuce and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know you're not supposed to be eating hamburgers. You had a heart attack. &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: Is red meat so bad? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it's not great for a guy who's gonna... &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: Well, how come you didn't show up on time to order me lunch?! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They bring you lunch! It's a normal meal they bring you that I set up every day. And they said, "Your father won't eat it." It's not gonna be hamburgers and hot dogs! &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: I know, but the stuff they gave me last time was &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Seeing my mom like this is probably the worst thing I've ever been through in my life. And it's frustrating seeing my dad neglecting his blood sugars and his diabetes. All I know from this experience is that life is short, and if you don't treat your body like a machine, it can go down. You know, all I want him to do is take better care of himself. &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: What are you so calm from? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Yo. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, I'm with Jeff. He's out of his mind right now. &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: Hey, Chris. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Hey, what's up? Aw, come on, relax. &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: Oh, yeah, it's really easy to say. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Where are you? At the hospital still? &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: No, we blew that place. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: You blew that place? &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: Yeah, Scott and I had a little rift, and he sped off in his car. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys were just pissing me off. You got to set a good vibe in Mom's room, and you guys are all screaming and yelling like animals. And you're yelling, "Wake up!" She just had a seizure. She's obviously sedated. I mean, think about it. I understand I need to be more sympathetic for my father's needs and what he's going through. It's just a tough situation that I never thought I'd have to deal with, and now that I'm dealing with it, I-I really don't know how. A lot of my defense mechanisms, I think, are to lean towards anger and not cope with it the right way. It's tough. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Put a good vibe in the room, and hopefully everything will be all right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I'm saying to do. &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: Well, she was all right last night, but then today she took a turn for the worst. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: My friend had his wife-- the same thing happened to her, okay? She was out of it for about a month. And then all of a sudden, miraculously she got better, and now she's fine. &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: That's gonna be Shuggy Bear. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. She's gonna be better and you got to believe that. And you have to be better about yourself. So when she gets better, you're there for her. &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's gonna take some time. &gt;&gt; JEFFREY: It's a roller coaster ride. 279 00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:08,598 One day she's up, one day she's down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's Bonnie? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, she had a seizure today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, not good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't r-really know what's happening here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, here we go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's so many people. I just know something big is going to happen. Did you see that? What is that? I can't breathe. I can't breathe right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, she has no idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, 'cause she goes, "Ugh, I feel so sick, I really don't want to go. I'm trying to lay down, and meeting with Kanye in 30 minutes to go back to San Fran. I would really love a simple night sleeping in, to be honest. I can't start throwing up again. I feel awful." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What happened? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim is, like, still at home, saying she feels so sick and she doesn't want to come and... But she's meeting up with him in 30 minutes. She was just saying how awful she feels. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? What time is it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's 7:10. So she still isn't at the dinner? She said it was at 6:00. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She hasn't met up with him yet. She's sick. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's still in L.A. We are not gonna leave at 8:30. There's no way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, we're gonna do whatever we're told to do. This isn't our thing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I... uh, yeah. But I'm saying, we're not gonna leave by 8:30. She's not gonna be here by 8:30. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is still in L.A., and the clock is ticking. Hopefully, the surprise doesn't get ruined. But we are gonna continue getting ready and just pray that Kim will get here when she's supposed to get here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. It's nothing. Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you going, to the Grammys? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're about to get down 319 00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:13,032 and dirty, people. &gt;&gt; CICI: Hey! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I feel bad wearing this necklace. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's Kim's, and I can't ask her if I can wear it. I'm worried she's gonna get mad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I promise she won't. I love surprises. She's gonna die when she sees all of us. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, she's gonna be shocked. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is Scott feeling better? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. He's at his parents'. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's Bonnie? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, she had a seizure today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, not good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What happened? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They gave her a lot of medication to make her out of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no. Hearing that Scott's mom has had a seizure really makes me want to just burst into tears. But I know I have to keep it together and be in the spirit of Kim and Kanye today, and keep Bonnie in my prayers. This day... highs are high, and 342 00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:28,447 the lows are low. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi! Oh, my God, good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a party now. First of all, thank you all for being here. This is gonna be so exciting on the big Kim K. birthday surprise party! Don't forget the rule of the night, until you hear otherwise... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To shake your! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: And your! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. And no social media until you hear from us, 'cause I don't want to get in trouble. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:I told Kim where we were! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shush! Oh, we can go now. Who's ready to go have a party? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're going to the stadium! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I guessed it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is happening? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: To get this many people here, to rent out a stadium, I don't want to jinx anything, but to me, there's no way it could just be a surprise for Kim-- there's something bigger. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who rents an entire stadium? Hello. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, what is going on? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I know! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't tell us. I don't know what's happening, but I like it. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: You like it. Hi. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But don't ask for any. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, I don't want to know a thing. This is a surprise in itself. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Anthony, good job on everything. You did such a good job. Like, yeah, welcome to my world. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, pull it together. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: I'm glad I'm in the energy business. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've got nine days, or you've got four days, or... Yeah, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so nervous. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: I am, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't r-really know what's happening here. &gt;&gt; KRIS:She's gonna die that you came. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ALLISON: Only for you, honey. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I don't know what's gonna happen. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't, either. We're surprising my sister for her birthday, and that's all I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When we walk into the baseball stadium, there's so many people-- way more than I expected. A lot of people that I don't even know. If you guys are here, something is happening. And then I see my Auntie Shelli and Lorraine Schwartz, who is a phenomenal jeweler. Lorraine lives in New York. There's no reason that she would be here, unless it was huge. I just know something big is gonna happen. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: What's really happening, though? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No one knows. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We don't know. Well, my mom knows. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, wait, they're gonna be here soon. It's getting really close to being the time, and I have butterflies in my stomach. I'm actually so nervous for Kim and for Kanye. I can't even imagine how he must be feeling right now, knowing what's gonna take place. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: My heart's, like, racing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dying. Dying. &gt;&gt; MAN: You should see what it's like out there. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kanye... well, how he was this morning, giving us his brief, is the only thing that... you know, this is his... What did he say? He had this idea since he was a kid. &gt;&gt; DIRECTOR: One thing I want everyone to realize is that before you guys start, there are Roman candles behind you. So the very first thing that's going to happen is these Roman candles are going to go off. Do not be alarmed. I really would love to hear the symphony get a little bit of sound check in. As soon as the symphony does a little bit of sound check, we'll do a complete run-through. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yo! &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Yo! &gt;&gt; MAN: Quiet! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Quiet! Quiet, and listen up, everybody! &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: So in about ten minutes-- they're on their way-- we're gonna load this whole crew in two of the dugouts on the field. Kris is gonna be in one, I'm gonna be in the other. We're sort of part of this whole experience, and we're gonna join, um, Kim and Kanye when they arrive at a certain point. And Kris will let you know for her dugout when to go and I'll let you know from our dugout when to go, but I think it'll be fairly obvious. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, everybody that came with me... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Team Kris! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Team Kris! And-and everyone else... &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: Oh, really? I didn't wear my T-shirt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, this is... this is a baseball game. What's wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, let's go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, back there. 432 00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:50,130 Let's go, this way. Okay, here we go. Please turn your cell phones off. If somebody's cell phone goes off, it'll ruin everything. And no talking! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The closer it gets to Kim and Kanye getting here, the crazier and crazier we are all getting. This is, like, such an adventure that I'm so excited to be a part of. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Be quiet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, she's gonnacry. 442 00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,260 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, you really can't talk. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everyone's cell phone off? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you..? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I can't. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Did you see that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's an orchestra. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: Three minutes, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Quiet. Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh. I'm super excited and trying to make sure that nobody makes a peep. I feel like I'm a kindergarten teacher, like, yelling at everybody, "Shut up!" But I want everybody to be quiet, because I want it to be perfect for him and for her. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: Car is entering. Shh. &gt;&gt; ROB: They're in a car, they're in a car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I can't breathe. I can't breathe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. 461 00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:26,635 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's truly a magical moment. &gt;&gt; ROB: They're in a car, they're in a car. They're in a car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I can't breathe. The lights better not flash on us. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kanye is a perfectionist, so I know that whatever the surprise is, it's gonna be something major. She is just gonna die when she knows that we're all here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the best thing I've ever seen in my life. 472 00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:22,228 I couldn't have written this better. &gt;&gt; ROB: She's blindfolded. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really am in a movie right now. This is so spectacular. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not a word. Not a word. Shh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You 478 00:23:38,712 --> 00:23:42,617 shut theup. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so stunning and breathtaking. The orchestra playing, Kanye and Kim watching it; we're all watching them. This is just... it's truly a magical moment and something I 485 00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:17,655 will never forget. : I'm gonna cry. I didn't know this was real life. I didn't know this was real. This is a movie. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I just want to know. &gt;&gt; KIM: You want to know what? &gt;&gt; KANYE: If you'll marry me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Of course. 493 00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:02,002 I can't believe this is happening. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I am honestly just so 496 00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:18,120 happy for Kim. Kanye is the most amazing guy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am so excited for Kim and Kanye. I cannot wait to run out on the 500 00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:29,632 field. She's gonna be so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Congratulations! &gt;&gt; KIM: The fact that Kanye was able to pull this off is the surprise of a lifetime. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just cannot wait for this wedding. 506 00:25:46,217 --> 00:25:49,053 More babies! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: The fact that Kanye has just thought this out so clearly and perfectly-- you can just feel how special this is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, let's 513 00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:23,424 everybody go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. To get engaged and then to see all my family and all my friends be there really surprises me. And it's so sweet that Kanye thought to bring them all here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Congratulations! This is like a movie! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What did you... Did you say yes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you surprised? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, shaking. It was amazing. So amazing. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You had no idea, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: None. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What did he say though? &gt;&gt; KIM: He said, "I love you so much and I just want to ask you, 'Will you marry me?'" I'm like, "Wait, is this really happening?" I'm like, "Oh, my God." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We were just asking what you said. And she said it was such a flash. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm like, "I was shaking..." &gt;&gt; KANYE: I forgot what I said. It's so crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe all my friends are here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's gonna be so upset that he wasn't here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yeah, did Scott know anything? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I mean, he knew it was, like, a big party. Scott couldn't be here with us. He knew that he needed to be with his family, but I'm gonna call and share with him the news. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, shaking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This will definitely be a night that we'll never forget. I love that Kanye shared it with all of us, and I cannot wait for the wedding. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, the perfect size on my hand. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I had to... I actually preferred to get a smaller stone that was flawless than some of the bigger offsets that were, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Smaller stone? This is, like, a huge stone. You got a huge stone that's... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You're gonna need 24-hour security with that ring. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kim, that is beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, can you let go of him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! He's mine now. He's all mine. ♫ ♫ I'm so excited for the life that they're gonna spend together and the journey that they're on and the love they have for each other and for North. And to be able to organize it with Kanye and Anthony and to be a part of it meant everything to me, and it's an experience I 559 00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:47,680 will never forget. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KANYE: Look at that, you see how it floats? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Just like... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Where to next? No. Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I knew he had the best taste. &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: Aw. &gt;&gt; KIM: He does. &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: That he does. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Before, it was, like, higher. &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: The original mounting...was like this. &gt;&gt; KANYE: This was a different mounting yesterday. This mounting was made today. &gt;&gt; LORRAINE: We were up all night. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It's just about the stone. &gt;&gt; KIM: It just... really is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I just can't believe I'm engaged. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys? Hello? Does this work? Oh, I love it. Kim and Kanye, to the two greatest roommates that a girl could ever have. I just want to say that, Kanye, you have felt like a son for a very long time. I love the way you treat my daughter and the way you are as a dad. And the fact that you did all of this tonight blows my mind. I can only imagine how my daughter feels. You've made us feel remarkable. Every single one of us you brought along on this fantasy. I just wanted to say, first, congratulations and I'm so excited for the life ahead. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I first want to say, Kim, I couldn't be happier for you. Kanye, I am so obsessed with you and I love you and I cannot wait to have you legally as a brother. But I still consider you as a brother now. I just cannot wait for this wedding. I am so excited. And let's have more kids! More babies! &gt;&gt; KIM: It is so crazy to me that this is all happening. Kanye really outdid himself. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Put Kanye on! &gt;&gt; KIM: What? I think he's said enough. He's said enough. It just... it feels like I'm in a dream. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just the most amazing experience. It's just crazy. I can't believe this is happening. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cheers me! &gt;&gt; KIM: I am the biggest investigator, so the fact that I didn't see one sign of this 606 00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:09,699 happening is the surprise of a lifetime. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm actually getting something to eat at the club. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, you are? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Kim just called me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, she did? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes. I guess she, uh... she said yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She did say yes. It was really, really, really... I wish you could've been there and you hadn't been traveling, because it was spectacular. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not even you did it that big. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Well, good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're gonna have a wedding! &gt;&gt; BRUCE:Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just had a long talk with the doctor, and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What did they say? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Basically, in a nutshell, the guy said at the end, he goes, "Look, I can't say she's doing better or worse." He goes, "I'm not saying she can't wake up. I'm just saying the longer it takes, the worse it is." Her blood's not doing great with her kidneys, so they're giving her dialysis and... checking her brain and that's it. She's doing, eh... maybe a drop worse, maybe the same. And my dad's doing way worse. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just don't understand the diet stuff, and I feel like he's probably been at home just eating and God knows what, you know what I mean? I just don't even know how to get this guy back under control. Unfortunately, my mom has been up and down in her condition. One day, it looks promising and then one day it doesn't. It's so frustrating because it's so out of your control. And then there's the stress of my father just deteriorating as well, and I'm trying to make sure I don'tjump off a ledge. It's a real potion for disaster, I guess. 642 00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,347 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I love you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, bye. This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: I invited the whole family to come out to Vegas for Kanye's concert. I wanted one last hurrah with the whole family before I leave with the baby to join him on tour. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Say cheers to Bonnie, too. It's so hard for me to focus when Scott is going through, you know, such a hard time. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: They're just deciding what to do at this point? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, we're gonna go home and talk about what we should do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fancy day, isn't it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I thought I should maybe pack something just in case. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I told you you should do that. I said you should go fo' sho. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm, well, he said he didn't want me to come today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, today we're coming to terms that Scott's mom is not getting any better. So I'm helping Kourt so she could be ready to pick up and go to New York at any minute. Scott is hesitant to accept Kourtney's help. It's heartbreaking to watch this happen and to happen so fast. Kourtney! Oh, Tits McGee. &gt;&gt; MASON: Tits McGee! &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Mason! &gt;&gt; MASON: Tits McGee! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I said "Hits McGee." That's Mom's new name. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just packed my toiletry bag, and then I don't know what I'm supposed to bring. Just, like, sweats? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, sweats or jeans and a T-shirt. Like, no heels or anything. You're going to the hospital. Like, just stuff to be, like, comfortable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's hard knowing that I can't do anything about this situation with Scott's mom. Scott is going through such a hard time right now. I'm just trying to be here for him and support him in anything that he needs and just try to remember what it was like with my dad and how I felt at the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Hits. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aah. My sister Khloe and I ate here together. We had a very romantic lunch. &gt;&gt; CUNHA: Cheers to the valley. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cheers. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Say cheers to Bonnie, too. &gt;&gt; CUNHA: Oh, cheers to Bonnie. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh. To Bonnie. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: She's in the hospital, but... they're just deciding what to do at this...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. It's, like, we're gonna go home and talk about what we should do. But they're waiting on one report from another doctor that Scott, like, sent it out to. So, I just don't know when I should go, but I just told him I'll come whenever. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Yeah. Do you think you should just go anyways? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what Khloe said. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's what I think, because you know what? Sometimes when you're going through stuff like this, you don't know how badly you actually need support and someone to be by your side. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but then I think, when I was going through with my dad, like, if... Like, my boyfriend at the time wasn't really there, and I didn't really need him to be. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: But that's... That was really different, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Like, Scott relies on you more than he relies on his parents. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Like, you guys are a partnership, you know... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Oh, wait. It's a blocked call. It might be him. Hello. Hi. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: This is so insane. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think a casket. Yeah. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: She said "a casket." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm gonna cry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is hard to hear Bonnie's in this state of limbo. She is such a great grandmother, and this is just such a reminder of how life is short, and it's just such a hard place to be in when you're unsure of what is going to happen next. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so surprised that Scott's here in Vegas. It just makes me wonder what's going on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What...? Did they give you a time? Yeah. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Wait. What? &gt;&gt; JOYCE: She said "a casket." &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm gonna cry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys are making me sad. You're making me... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It is sad, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just 'cause... 'cause it's sad. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: She always says to me... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, no way. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Every time, she says to me, she's like, "You're always nice to my Scottie." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Oh. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: "Thank you. No, he tells me. He tells me." And I'm like, "Okay." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you talking about Bonnie? &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Aw. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, Malika's talking about your mom. Okay. Love you. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; JOYCE: You just said the word "casket." Like, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Even though we really don't know what's gonna happen and Bonnie's general condition is the same, we're just trying to be prepared for whatever may happen. 740 00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:56,270 &gt;&gt; MALIKA: We'll definitely send a couple prayers up for her. &gt;&gt; KIM: I invited the whole family to come out to Vegas for Kanye's concert. I wanted one big last hurrah with the whole family before I leave with the baby to join him on tour. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe you're on this tour, and you're not going to be home for so long. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need a break from you and your house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I miss you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You'll be fine. Don't worry. We'll be back for a few more months. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It just seems like a really long time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Trust me, you'll love it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm getting lonely already. 757 00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:35,777 It's weird. Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so surprised that Scott's here in Vegas, and it's just making me anxious because of everything with his mom. 762 00:40:47,824 --> 00:40:51,495 And it just makes me wonder what's going on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott kind of needs a little breather. He needs to get away. He's been dealing with so many hospitals and negative stuff. So I helped get Scott from New York to Vegas. I just wanted to surprise Kourt. Well, Scott really wanted to surprise Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so excited. I'm really happy that Scott came to Vegas. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm chilling. I'm good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's definitely been a little bit withdrawn and I think wanting to be with everyone that loves him, and I think he just needed to get out of New York for the night. I know that he needs me now more than ever, so I'm gonna go back with him to New York from Vegas. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's your baby daddy. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have had some really high highs and a lot of low lows-- with my mom and Bruce separating, and Khloe and Lamar going through a hard time, and Scott's mom being sick. It's really hard. What I've learned is that life throws you happy moments and sad moments, and you can never really plan for what's to come. And I guess that's what happens when you have a big family. There's always a lot going on. And I'm just honestly so happy that I have Kanye to share my life with, and we now have our little family, and we're there to support each other no matter what. &gt;&gt; CROWD: Yeezus! Yeezus! Yeezus! Yeezus! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to come with us or stay here? &gt;&gt; BONNIE: I'm gonna stay here. I'm gonna play with Mason. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; BONNIE: Masey and I are gonna play, right? We're playing with the train. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're having a yard sale. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: People are coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All of the money goes to feed children. &gt;&gt; KIM: My skis? Who said I would sell my skis? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: House hunting. Are you excited? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honestly, I believe it's gonna be a big adjustment for Kendall to move out on her own, but it's good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you think it's weird, we're on opposite pages when it comes to Kendall? I just want to know why he's in such a rush about Kendall moving out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God.
