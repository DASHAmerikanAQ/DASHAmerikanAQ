- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's so much traffic in this city. &gt;&gt; It's almost 5:00. It's rush hour. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's rush hour, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, babe. I'm about to pick up my Bentley. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, Bentley. &gt;&gt; KIM: So my Bentley is finally ready. It's taken forever to get the rims hooked up and to do everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Kim, what'd you do to your car? &gt;&gt; KIM: Black on black on black with like like red stitching, red B's. It's just all blacked out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aye, Carumba. &gt;&gt; KIM: I worked very hard for this car. Since I've been 12 years old, it's been my dream to get a Bentley. This is gonna be the new sleek look. Get rid of the pink. And I've given it my all to make this dream come true. I want to share it with Khloe and Kourtney, and then we're on our way to see Rob, and I want to drive all around town and just-- I'm so excited. We're almost there. I'm going to be riding around in my new Bentley. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, Kim. Kim said "Bentley" about 25 times. We know you're getting a Bentley. Alright, we're ready &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brandon! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. Hey, the guys... Bert. You know my two boys-- Bert and Brandon, are my older sons that I had before I met Kris. All right, the studio. How's the music business? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Excellent. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you have enough buttons? You know, Brandon is like my age when I won the Games. And it's fun to see him with all his little toys. We got your little hot rod here. Your Porsche killer. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, it'll take anything down. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When I was his age, there was nobody in the world that had more toys than me. At one time, I had three airplanes, Hobie Cats, cars, snowmobiles, jet skis, wind surfers-- I had it all. And then I met Kris... and picked up ten kids. It's all gone. I had so many toys, it was a joke. &gt;&gt; BERT: So what's the deal here? When are we getting a little hot car? Something to have fun in. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm a carpool guy. I carpool for a living. That's what I do. I certainly miss the airplanes. You know, my old motorcycle-- I miss that. But, you know, it's not like I really need it. ♫ All I do is carpool Yeah And it ain't no fun... ♫ &gt;&gt; BERT: Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ♫ Kendal and Kylie In the backseat Asking questions... ♫ &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Are we there yet? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I did that without one beer. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Props from me, I'll tell you what. &gt;&gt; BERT: That's right. Props from me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, let's go shoot some pool. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: My car is not ready. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: No more than ten minutes-- I promise you it's going to be done. They're already on the last thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The guy keeps telling us it will be 15 minutes. 15 minutes later he comes back, it'll be 15 more minutes. &gt;&gt; KIM: How much longer, though? 'Cause we have to be out... &gt;&gt; 15 minutes, ten minutes. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: 15 more minutes, ten more minutes. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's taken forever to get my car. And as we're waiting, I hear Kourtney and Khloe screaming. I don't know what they're doing. This is my business deal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're yelling at her telling her $35,000... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I said, "You're wasting everybody's time and money by having us sit here. Don'tus. Tell us what's going on." And he said, "Baby, talk about wasting money-- I put $35,000 into this car for free." I don't give ahow much your car cost. That's not about me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, let's fight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And he agreed to do something, so he shouldn't be throwing it in your face. If you say you're going to do something, then do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So Khloe starts giving him an attitude. The guy yells at Khloe, and Kim doesn't defend her. &gt;&gt; KIM: And it's rude and it's making me look bad, so stop. Khloe and Kourtney are so rude to Chris, the guy that owns the dealership. I am just so appalled. They are speaking to me like this, and to the car guy like this? Stop and go get in the car and stop being rude and a brat. It's not funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will never look at you the same. You're my sister. &gt;&gt; KIM: He didn't... he didn't talk... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're my sister. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, I think you're so gross. All you care about is money. &gt;&gt; KIM: All I care about is money? He has my$220,000 car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who cares? You're such a kiss-ass. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not going with you, sweetheart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No loyalty! &gt;&gt; KIM: Act like this-- like youlittle immature bitch. Leave. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh. We don't care. Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Then stop acting so immature. Then leave, get out of here. This isn't your place. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would if I could, sweetheart. I have no reason to see you get a Bentley. Now I know about my sister! &gt;&gt; KIM: You are so jealous. You are just so jealous that you cannot get a Bentley, and you're trying to ruin my moment for me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you joking? &gt;&gt; KIM: So get away, you jealous psycho-bitch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to be here anymore. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KIM: They think it's funny. They think it's a joke, and it's not. Hey, Mom, can I talk to you? I hate my sisters. They are so rude. You have no idea how much they humiliated me tonight. I never want to look at their ugly faces again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob! &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and I... &gt;&gt; ROB: I cannot handle this right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...just got in the biggest fight with Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Even though there's been so much fighting, so much arguing, at this point, I don't care whose fault it is. I need to make it right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We went to the car dealership for her all the way from Beverly Hills to North Hollywood. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're kissing this guy's ass to get your car fixed instead of caring about us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, my feelings are really hurt that she let some loser yell at me. Like, "Talk to my sisters like that. I don't care about these bitches..." whatever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, Kim doesn't say anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim doesn't give a , because people control her, because she's a weak duck. Kourtney and I are strong queens, and we don't deal with theprincess like that. &gt;&gt; ROB: ...face up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but she's letting this guy talk to her... letting him do it to my face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Letting her... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't be so rude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; KIM: I swear to God, don't be throwing the thing on me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'llhurt you. Don't do that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM:bitch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out. &gt;&gt; KIM: I open the door, and Khloe slams the door right in my face. And it infuriates me. Like I literally want to kill her. Don't bethrowing the thing on me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'llhurt you. I'm so angry. No, you're talkingabout me already... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out. &gt;&gt; KIM: You tried to slam the door in my face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, we're talking about you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, this is my place! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out. You're not wanted. &gt;&gt; ROB: I've never really seen my sisters fight like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw, go cry. 'Cause no one wants you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe and Kourtney are saying, like, nasty names about Kim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She doesn't care about our feelings. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim, don't hit her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to leave. Thanks for leaving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go with your Bentley that no one could afford. We don't want your Bentley. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim, you're being stupid right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, she's crying. Do you hear her crying? Like we care. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wish I'd punched her harder. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, they're rude and she tried to slam the door in my face-- I want to go. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Don't leave, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, she's crying. Do you hear her crying? Like we care. I don't give a She hurt my feelings so badly. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Kim, stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Everybody's picking on her. Are you really leaving? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really leaving. Khloe and Kourtney are being really mean. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She hit me really hard, but because I'm a bigger girl, I know not to hit her, because I will really, like, give her a concussion, and that's not what I, I'm not trying to hurt my sister &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is taking this situation way too far. We don't get physical with each other, and there's no need to get physical about this. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Kim, you're being stupid right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm not. I'm not gonna take them all ganging up on me and being mean. Over what? Over the fact that I bought a new car? I wish I'd pinched her harder. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! The little baby. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What are you saying? She's your sister. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My sister just hit me. Okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, this is mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, what is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A lot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you being so mean and vicious? It's just like you're in a playground. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris, you weren't there, and you know what? Just because she gives you ten percent you're gonna kiss her ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're supposed to be supportive and loving of one another. It's just gone a little too far, and I'm done. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You weren't there and we're just venting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you definitely like Kim more. Just because I don't show emotion easily, or as easy as Kim does, my feelings are still hurt, and why are you picking anybody's side. This has nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! &gt;&gt; Sexy woman. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come here. So with all the drama happening with Kim and Khloe, I'm really feeling stressed out and, like, I need to get out and go have some fun with one of my girlfriends. &gt;&gt; So great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I call my girlfriend, Ellen K., and Ellen and I are gonna blow off some steam. &gt;&gt; BOTH: Cheers! &gt;&gt; KRIS: To the girls. They're all driving me nuts. I'm ready to lose my mind. &gt;&gt; Would you like another one? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, please. &gt;&gt;I love it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. &gt;&gt; Let's get a couple of shots. &gt;&gt; Shots? &gt;&gt; BOTH: Oh, my God. Shakey, shakey, shakey. &gt;&gt; Licky, licky. You're hilarious. Chug it, doll. Here's to us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And to us. It's been a while since I've been out for a drink with a girlfriend, so I get a little crazy, and a little out of control, and I do something really silly. &gt;&gt; Oh, my God. I'll wait for you in the car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you're going first, doll. &gt;&gt; Oh, my. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; Hi. Can I help you? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we want... tattoos? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ellen says she's always wanted to get a tattoo of her son's name somewhere. Like right here... Or right here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Or right here. Or just on her ass. &gt;&gt; I'd go with the ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I'm thinking, "Oh, my God, I'm so in love with this idea." But my problem is I have, like, 32 children, so how do you put everybody's name on your body? You don't. And you know what? I'm not so happy with the older kids right now, so Kendal and Kylie get names and Kim and Kourtney and Khloe don't. &gt;&gt; Who's gonna go first? &gt;&gt; Uh, she is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's going first. Oh, come here, let me smell. &gt;&gt; Just a little smell, not... &gt;&gt; You're a pervert. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come here. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; ...take a few minutes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I shouldn't necessarily be having tattoos done at this age. It sounded like a good idea, after a couple of shots. But you know what? I love it. It's really cute. The girls will love it. It looks really good. That's all that matters. &gt;&gt; Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, bye. &gt;&gt; See ya later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks again. &gt;&gt; This is an unforgettable night-- it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna kill that guy with the needle. &gt;&gt; BOTH: &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's what my life's come to. In the old days, I used to fly big helicopters. Now, I'm down to... my little toy helicopter. Yeah, yeah, come on, come on, come on, keep coming around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce has been flying that helicopter all afternoon, and he's acting like a little kid. And it's driving me nuts. Hey, do you like the tat? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you joking? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't it great? You look cute, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you being so nice to me all of a sudden? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause you're <i>fabulous.</i> &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You were mean to me earlier, so I really don't like you very much, at the moment. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, I wasn't mean to you earlier. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You heard Kimberly's side of the story, and you just went and... jumped on being on Kim's side, and you're defending Kim and you're, you're blaming it on me and saying that this was all my fault... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't like it, as a mom, when three of my children are up against one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure. I don't like it either. I don't like it either. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. If it was you against the other three, I would have felt the same way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Even if you think I am a liar, and you don't believe anything I say, you're the mom. Don't admit that. Don't let us know whose side you're picking 'cause it hurts other people's feelings. That's all I was saying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What is going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's upset because I took Kim's side last night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. No. Kourtney... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't take anybody's side; just everybody chill out. Everybody's at fault. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get that thing away from me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Coming in for the landing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hope it crashes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Normally, when we fight, it's over in a couple of minutes, but this fight was a little more intense than most fights, so we all decide to go meet at this coffee shop and just kind of talk things out. Why don't you get off your phone and give us a little bit of attention, and tell us how you feel. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel that, yes, it's so annoying that my car was late, that it wasn't ready. He told me it <i>was</i> gonna be ready, however, you both embarrassed me and were so rude to me, when it's a business deal and, um, I did not pay whatever I paid for that car to not leave without my car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: None of us said to leave. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We never said to leave without your car. I think we were wrong for saying that in front of him, however, that guy was wrong, how he talked down to me. That's not okay with me and it shouldn't be okay with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: He also helped me, 'cause it's really hard to get in a car that expensive. I'm not budging because I didn't do anything wrong. I don't see it. I never will see it. And this is pointless. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't even care. You're right in your mind. So you're never gonna be wrong because you've never bent. You never apologize. &gt;&gt; KIM: I always... Oh, I completely do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't let it bother me anymore. I'm in a different place. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I feel the same way, that I need to let you guys out of my life a little bit and go with my own life. I don't want to work as closely and I just think I need to separate myself. Maybe we work too much together. We play together. We do everything together, and I think that maybe I need to step back and do some things on my own. I just... I think maybe, in the long run, it'll be better for us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This conversation is not going any which way I thought it was gonna go. The conversations start turning into something so heady and so about business. Like,business. This is about us as a family. This is not how we were raised. Kim acts... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm acting like anything, Khloe. I came here to act like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, you do. You don't have a sense of loyalty, and it shocks me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I really don't think that you guys don't see... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I said where I thought I was wrong, and I agree with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I don't think that I was wrong. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't think you were wrong at all. &gt;&gt; KIM: By getting my Bentley? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you think that's what we're mad at, you're completely wrong. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tell me where I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Figure it out for yourself. Our conversation is over, and I don't really feel like it went anywhere because Kim can't admit anything that she's done is wrong. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, why are you crying? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This conversation was supposed to make us stronger and not, like, more distant from each other. And I don't want us to change our love and our relationships with each other. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe's just really upset about it and wants us all to get along. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We had a fight. Like, let's get over it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe's definitely the most sensitive one out of all of us. She just doesn't act like it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't like that she's, like, "Well, then all I'm gonna do is work with you." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's just saying that to try and piss you off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't... It doesn't piss me off. It makes me sad because Dad would never let any of this happen, and this is not what we're supposed to be doing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm trying to help her, but if she doesn't want to help, what am I gonna do? I can't force her. If she wants to, you know, listen, then that's her decision. All you can do is say something. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go to Breckenridge-- I love it! &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't feel like laughing, skiing and snowboarding with them. I think we need time apart. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want... I'm just so upset. Kourtney and Khloe are just, like, so mean to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really have not heard my kids fight like this since they were toddlers. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to talk to them and I'm not gonna talk to them-- I've had it with them! &gt;&gt; KRIS: The whole thing is ridiculous. These kids need to grow up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I really don't get this. Like, it's been a couple days. She hasn't called and apologized. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe she feels like you owe <i>her</i> one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Too bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, no, <i>not</i> too bad. You know what, Khloe? Buh-bye. I don't want to listen to it anymore. I'm done being the mediator. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Done! Ugh! Honey... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why did we have so many children? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was all your idea. Hey, honey, what do you think? Should I go with bangs or no bangs? I mean, back in the '70s, I wore it with bangs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bangs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bangs? You're saying bangs or no bangs? Too much forehead. What do you think? Look a little younger, you know, a little hip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're freaking me out. That's annoying. Don't move like that. It freaks me out. It's bad enough that the girls are fighting, but now I think Bruce has lost his mind. Don't, don't, don't try to dance-- stop! The hair, the toys, wanting to be hip. I think Bruce is going through a midlife crisis. Why are we talking about your hair when I really need to focus on my girls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are they complaining about their "Bentley"? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, kind of. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, that's what I thought. Maybe they shouldn't have Bentleys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I agree, but they're 27 years old. When was the last time you told a 27-year-old what to do and they actually did it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe we should do what we did when they were kids. Take them all snow skiing. Instead of all the tension around here, let's just go skiing for three or four days because the girls are all good skiers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, is this about the girls or is this about you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good question. Uh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to go skiing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it's a good excuse for everybody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When everybody's stressed out, everyone's fighting, you know what? A family vacation may be just the ticket. Breckenridge, Colorado has a golf course. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know it has a golf course, but it's in the middle of the winter, honey, we're not gonna be playing golf. We're going there to go skiing. But I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Then they have Breckenridge.com also. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Which is the ski area? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ski schools, all of that? Cool. Let's go to Breckenridge. I love it! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, can you toss the salad? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How about those two? Want to do it with those? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Fine. It's fabulous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When my mom mentions that we're going on a family vacation, I'm thrilled, but I really don't want to sit next to Kim, I don't want to sleep next to Kim, I don't want to eat next to Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just think you should just be a little bit extra sensitive with Kim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, Mom! Okay! I'd rather keep my distance and not have another argument with her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you gonna use that entire thing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. And I use an entire thing of butter. That's why this is so good for you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And this won't give us cellulite. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good thing Kimberly's working tonight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She won't have to get the cellulite. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim has enough to last her a lifetime. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Do not leave your baggage unattended. Please report all unattended baggage to law enforcement officers. It really has. You guys have got to learn how to get along because if you don't... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's no tension. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, there is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, there's not. We're just not talking to Kim. There's no tension. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's tension. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're just not talking to her; it's fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. My mom thinks that she can still try and make us kiss and make up when she wants us to, but that's just not how we feel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to sit next to Kim, so make sure I'm sitting... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're talking to the enemy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The enemy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think that it's fair that I'm forced to go on this trip. I don't feel like being with them. I don't feel like talking to them. I don't feel like spending time with them. I don't feel like laughing, skiing and snowboarding with them. I think we need time apart. &gt;&gt; CAPTAIN: This is your captain speaking. We're experiencing some turbulence, so if you can return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. Thank you. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: Next time on <i>Keeping Up with the</i> <i>Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People that can't afford Bentleys ride in this car. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would rather not be here! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then go! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Or we could just take these little things and maybe throw them away. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't do that, Mom! &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's see if yours work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why don't you just go home?! &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not funny! Get out if you're gonna continue to laugh and make fun of me!
