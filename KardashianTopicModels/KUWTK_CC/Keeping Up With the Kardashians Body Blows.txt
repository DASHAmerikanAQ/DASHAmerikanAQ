- &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Tonight on <i>Keeping Up with the</i> <i>Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We'll have a charity boxing event with the family. People bid on us and the highest bidder gets to fight each one. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Kim Kardashian! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not what we signed up for! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce is speaking here tonight. We all support what everyone in our family does. Tonight is a very special night because Bruce is being honored by the Boys &amp; Girls Club of America. The whole family's been invited to be here tonight to show support for the organization and for Bruce. Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. What's going on? Where are you? "At the mall with Scott"? "Target"? Kourtney, you're supposed to be at this dinner with us tonight here. They're honoring Bruce and it's rude. I'll just tell Bruce that you couldn't make it 'cause you're at Target. Khloe, where are you? Why couldn't you just show up for Bruce? It's, like, unreal. I just wanted to confirm you weren't coming, Khloe, and I'm sorry to put pressure on you, but I'm so disappointed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Charity is so important, that we give something back. And to not have these girls show up when they have been so blessed in their lives, really disappoints me. &gt;&gt; HOST: Let's welcome Bruce Jenner! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you very much. It is so important that so many young people that are out there, provided with the right opportunity... ...having tremendous opportunity that they can really survive and grow. It is so important that we support our children in our community. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't see Kim, Kourtney, or Khloe. Let's talk about support. Yeah, support, support... BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't touch that, please. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is some sick... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can be a horse for Halloween. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hit her. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Choky! &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow! You're really choking me! Stop! Ow! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's hair! Don't touch my sister! &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, seriously, Khloe, stop. Stop. It's not funny anymore. You're stretching out my jeans. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, you stretched them out! Like, a lot! Kourtney and Khloe roughhouse all the time. It's just not what I like to do. I don't like to be touched and picked up and hit and slammed on the ground. It's just not my thing. You just ruined my jeans. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your ass is huge. It's fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, you're so, like, not fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who cares? I'm not trying to be fun. What do I care? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just want to be a boring whore your whole life? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not funny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sometimes, I can get so disappointed with these girls. The other night, the Boys &amp; Girls Club-- I mean, I was, like, devastated that nobody showed up. They all said-- every one of them said-- that they would be there. Now, I think Kimberly had a good excuse; at least she was working. Not fair to the charities. I am so disappointed. I really feel like I have to come up with some charity that the whole family can get involved with to show these kids that we've got to help out other people. All right, I'm doing the dishes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to open a bottle of wine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Of course you are! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, doll. Guess what we're doing tomorrow. My mom's friend was over, and she had her three kids over. She was like, "I never get to do anything." Like her and her husband, they don't have any help. So my mom was joking around that you and I should baby-sit. Like, Scott... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why shouldn't we? You... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll tell you one good reason why not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not a baby-sitter. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But you've never been around kids, and we're about to have one any day... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Exactly why. I'm not an experienced baby-sitter. I'm not going to start now baby-sitting other people's kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I'm going to be there, too. Like, I'm sure... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, can you handle it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sure I have maternal instincts. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, what are you saying, I don't? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly, so... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm good! I don't need to prove it! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you have to prove it to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I need to prove it to you? How old's this one kid? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It'll be fun. There's three kids. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Three? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not running a petting zoo. You've lost your mind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I already said "yes." The kids are coming. Love it and enjoy it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I love you. Watch me be a better baby-sitter than you are. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Oh! Are you okay in there, buddy? I'm Rob. What's your name? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rocky! R-r-rocky! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rock-O! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Time for a family meeting. Let's get everybody together. I finally come up with an idea that I think is going to work to give something back to this community. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, what's going on? Why are we all here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, last week at the Boys &amp; Girls Club-- it was upsetting. We just didn't do it right. But I think it's really important, me, as kind of the dad of the family, to be able to bring the family together and kind of keep us grounded. So, I came up with this idea. And basically what it is, is... Uh, we'll have a charity boxing event with the family. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm trying to raise a lot of money for charity-- the Dream Foundation, an absolutely great organization. And then, I was out playing golf with a friend of mine, who actually works for TKO, and he puts these boxing events on. And I thought to myself, you know what? That is something so different. It'll get so much attention, and it's something that the kids would never do. What people do is they bid on us, and the highest bidder gets to fight each one of us. Now... &gt;&gt; KRIS: "The highest bidder"? &gt;&gt; KIM: One could be, like, a serial killer. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A soul assassin. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well... &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, someone could beat theout of one of us if they pay enough money? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: <i>Vatos locos.</i> &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, basically. I'm telling ya, a bunch of chickens. We're not fighting professional boxers. We're fighting, you know, people that are doing this for charity. They got all the protection. It's going to be sanctioned by the athletic commission. There's going to be referees. Come on! Kourtney, I know you would do it, but you're pregnant. You're out. Honey, you got that bad neck. You're out. So, it's going to be Kim, Scott, Rob, me... &gt;&gt; KIM: There's no way that I'm boxing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, come on, you'll box. &gt;&gt; KIM: There is absolutely no way-- I don't care if it's for a charity or not-- that anyone is going to make me fight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She is not Sugar Ray Leonard! She's not boxing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She'll be... She'll box. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: People want to beat theout of you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whatever money they think-- how about this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can't buy your way out of this thing. You cannot... &gt;&gt; KIM: Whatever money, I'll pay the Dream Foundation double. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourt! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't you hold this little one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No thanks. I'm not trying to insult Scott, but he can use the experience. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce Jenner, come to the office, please. Bruce Jenner to the office. Thank you. Hey, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Should I shut the door? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. What did I do now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, listen, I really feel uncomfortable about the fact that all of you are doing this big fight, this boxing match. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's wrong with it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that... Kimberly... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's going to be sanctioned. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, there, there's officials. They got gloves on. They got protection. Nothing's going to happen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? Bruce, you're 60 years old. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Me?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're going to be 60 years old in five minutes. Yeah, you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What I got left over is more than what most people ever had. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just feel like you have something to prove and I think your ego's getting in the way. Honey, I can handle anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Watch me. I'm taking no prisoners. See you in the ring. &gt;&gt; SARAH: Hello. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, everybody. &gt;&gt; SARAH: We're here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you doing? &gt;&gt; SARAH: Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, guys. You ready to get "sat"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom's friend, Sarah, is dropping off her kids, and I'm really looking forward to this. They're all super cute and nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here's some flat water, not sparkling. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not trying to insult Scott, but facts are facts. He can use the experience. &gt;&gt; SARAH: Okay, you guys have fun. We'll see you later. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye. &gt;&gt; SARAH: Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You'll be back in an hour? &gt;&gt; SARAH: We'll be back in around five hours. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, buddy. Calm down. Tell me what the problem is and I'll fix it. I'm a problem-fixer. Hey. Hey, buddy. Kourt! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm thinking I'm going back to Miami for a couple months. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, we basically started that store and then left. And we haven't been back since. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, would Kourtney go back? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Duh! As soon as that baby pops out, she's going to have to get out of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Every time I had a baby, I didn't run to another state, especially 3,000 miles away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you were... You were married and a bore. What do you think Scott and Kourtney are doing with those babies? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The fact that she's at the house right now with three kids is beyond. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think Scott knows how to change diapers? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And he's probably wearing a three-piece suit over there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourt! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't you hold this little one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, no, thanks. Okay, let's... You guys, you want to sit down on the table right here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How long do I do this for? Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A while. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What does that mean, "a while"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, how are your cookies? Delicious? Good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've got to call a baby-sitter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't just shove a bunch of food down a baby's air pipe. They'll get sick and throw up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And she'll throw up on them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney used to throw up on me all the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, duh, she was a baby. Kourtney's going to go, "Excuse me. Will you just pick up your bottle and eat? What do you need me to help you for?" Kourtney's going to be so mean. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to give her more credit than that. She's not going to be like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't pull my hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Oh, my God, baby. What is this doing for you? I mean, does it really help, your tears? Like, what do these tears mean?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doll, what are you doing over there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know, but he's pulling my hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Stop it, now. Stop crying." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look very uncomfortable. He's crying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know she's afraid to hold a baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, wait till the baby comes. She's going to be speed-dialing my house. Like a crack addict. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What in God's name? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Help me. Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God! One minute with this little guy. You guys all right over there? You guys-- where are you guys? You guys are good, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is so, so, so... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He needs his formula. Can you get on it already? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Touching someone else's breast milk-- do you understand how gross that is? This is so disgusting. And this is not stuff that I want to be doing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. All right. Now we're talking. This kid's going to work here. Kourt, you're doing great. Thanks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No prob. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Doing a drive-by. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What am I doing here? I heard you weren't too excited about my boxing idea, so... Ah, the big draw for the boxing match is going to be Kim. I mean, who wouldn't want to see Kim get into a boxing ring? I've got to convince her that she can do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have business and stuff. I have, like, my Carl's Jr. commercial in, like, two weeks. If someone breaks my nose, there goes my Carl's Jr. commercial. Whatever money they think that-- how about this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can't buy your way out of this thing. You cannot buy your way out of this thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...bid on me, I'll pay the Dream Foundation double. So, that actually benefits the Dream Foundation. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, the whole idea of this thing is to do something different... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's to raise money for charity, so if I pay the charity... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...different with the family. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, that's not... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, something we would traditionally never do. You will go through this experience and you'll come out the other side a stronger person. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm probably not going to get out of this one. Bruce has his mind set up that we're going to go box. So, fine, I agree to do it, but the first chance that I get, I'm just going to fall out on the floor and take a dive. You never said I had to win. You said I had to box. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I'll start off with that, that you'll do it. And we'll work on the fighting side of it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Give me a hug. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll get in the ring. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Overcoming your fears is good, okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And remember, when you see this coming... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just going to go... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Back up or duck. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Yes, I was. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why are you trying to scare me like that? You know I'm scared of witches. What were you? &gt;&gt; GIRL: He was Buzz. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Say it. &gt;&gt; BOY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Say it. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Eh. What the...? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, man! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm really shocked at how well Scott is doing with all these kids. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Foam me. Slink me. Nice, nice! Oh! Wake up! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come here, little frog! Are you a little frog? Are you a froggy! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is handling this so, so well, but, on the other hand, I'm wondering am <i>I</i> ready for this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you guys... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott! Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: <i>What?</i> I'll be back in two minutes. If I'm not, just wait longer. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's the situa... Whoa, whoa, look at the ... on this kid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you see stuff in it? Oh, there's no poo. Thank God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, you're good. Good to go. Let's get your boo back up. Done-zo! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like I'm gonna be such a horrible mom. What a crazy reality check. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah, you like that? All right, we're good. Let's go back to the woman. Here, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, he's crying. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got to learn to deal with the crying. He'll get over it as long as you're good with him. You guys want to go to the toy store? &gt;&gt; GIRL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: On me. Toy store! Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, Scott cannot leave me alone with this baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Livin' the dream! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right? So, I get this text from Kourtney saying: "Get back to the house," exclamation mark. She has completely lost her mind. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Rob Kardashian! &gt;&gt; ROB: And the guy's coming at me full-force, trying to just rip my head off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Silence! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, let's get you all hooked up, partner. Okay, we're good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right? What happened?! So, I get this text from Kourtney saying: "Get back to the house," exclamation mark, exclamation mark. She has completely lost her mind. Doll, what's wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can you take the baby? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh... Okay. Good little sleeping baby. I'm gonna sleep good tonight, too, now, 'cause now you got me tired. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know I didn't have a lot of faith in Scott before and I thought that <i>he</i> needed the experience, but I'm glad that I was wrong and that at least one of us knows what we're doing. You finally got him to sleep? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it's not that hard. I just told him a little good-night story. I told him how I met you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SARAH: Hello... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? &gt;&gt; SARAH: Cool. Hey. Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look who's here. &gt;&gt; SARAH: Did they wear you out? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Thank God these kids' mother's back. I have been so excited to just forget about this miserable day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's been sleeping for a little. &gt;&gt; SARAH: Is he zonked? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's pretty tired. &gt;&gt; SARAH: You look pretty comfy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, he's doing good. I actually surprised myself. I never in a million years thought I'd be a decent man-sitter, but I did okay, and I feel better knowing I'm going to be a pretty good father. You guys want to come say bye to me? Give me a high five, Ash? Or something? A hug? A kiss? Something? &gt;&gt; SARAH: Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on, guys. Off you go. &gt;&gt; SARAH: Here we go, baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Buh-bye. &gt;&gt; SARAH: Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys get home safe. Car seats. Whoo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today is the first day of our boxing training. I'm so excited to see what everyone else is going to do, especially Kim. &gt;&gt; ROB: Boxing's rhythm. If anyone can dance, they can box. If you guys can't dance, you won't be able to box. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I was not good at dancing. &gt;&gt; ROB: Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Didn't you see <i>Dancing</i> <i>with the Stars?</i> &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She was awesome. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She was eliminated the second week. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What happened to the genetics when it came to Kim? She just doesn't seem to be very tough at all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Too much Chanel too young. Why is he jumping like that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. Kangaroo Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Doing this boxing stuff. Show these kids that the old man's still got it. This is fun stuff. &gt;&gt; ROB: Move around, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: MY godfather's Sugar Ray Leonard, so I think I've always kind of had a desire for boxing. I love boxing as a workout. I've been doing it for years and years. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Time! &gt;&gt; KIM: Way to kick some ass, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe is bad-ass in the ring. I know I cannot fight like that. I am going to be humiliated, and I know I'm going to get hurt. &gt;&gt; ROB: Let's go. Round one. Time in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then he's going to hit you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't care about hurting anyone. I care about me being hurt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me just hit you, so you can know how it feels. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, get mad, Kim. Get mad. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe, just get in there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get mad. Get mad. I justyour boyfriend. Get mad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow. &gt;&gt; ROB: Time! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You could hit really hard, but you try to be so pretty all the time with all your makeup and eyeliner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doll, I'm home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How was your workout? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Tiring. What did you do all day? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just chilled. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did you do, like, your baby reading and stuff? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: After baby-sitting, I just feel like I'm an awful parent, so what's... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doll, you weren't supposed to be a parent. You were supposed to be a baby-sitter. Those weren't your kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I had these people over to, like, try to show you and test your skill. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me tell you something. Even if I weren't great, I'd hope you would treat me the way I'm treating you and understand that those weren't our kids, and when it happens to be our own, it will be a different thing, and we'll be great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so grateful that I have Scott here, who has confidence in me and I feel so bad that I was so skeptical of him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Give yourself a break. You're gonna be amazing. You are in everything you do. Okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you. I love you. I love you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Sunshine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are the chances? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She made it. It's time. Let's go down and do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. I have to go to the bathroom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Make it quick. Today, the big auction. We're going to find out how much we're worth in the ring and, uh, how much we're going to raise for charity and who we're going to fight, even more importantly. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't feel good. I feel like I'm going to throw up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's the wrong way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where'd you go? Kim? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wait, you're drinking a Coke in the closet. Let's go. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, Kardashian. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my gosh. Well, this is Awkward City. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think you could safely say that all of us are very uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; AUCTIONEER: Hi, everybody. I would like to welcome you to the Kardashian Charity Knockout Auction. The winners from today's auction will, of course, box in the main event at the Commerce Casino here in Los Angeles. Your money today is going to benefit the Dream Foundation, which is the first and largest national granting organization for adults with life-threatening illnesses, so it's a wonderful charity and they are ready to box and you're going to bid on them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're not that ready. &gt;&gt; KIM: Most of these people look like they, you know, are here for the cause, but this is terrifying. There's a few people you can definitely tell just kind of want to say they've knocked out a Kardashian. &gt;&gt; AUCTIONEER: First up on today's auction block is a very rare opportunity to box the gold medal Olympian Bruce Jenner, right here to my right. Let's give him a round of applause. We'll take the opening bid at $100. Do we hear $100? And $100's bid. Go two and three and $400. Show me the $400? Go four and $500. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, two grand. &gt;&gt; AUCTIONEER: That's right. Come on, we got two grand. Two grand. Sold for $2,000. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce's opponent is much younger than Bruce. He's bulkier than Bruce. He has tattoos everywhere. I mean, Mr. 76 is about to be 86'd. &gt;&gt; AUCTIONEER: So, now we're going to offer an opportunity to step into the boxing ring with the one and only, the lovely Kim Kardashian. Let's give her a round of applause for donating some services here. Very good. A thousand off to my left. A thousand. $1,100. $1,000. Do I hear $1,200? 15 on the outside. Go 16. $1,800. Do I hear $2,000? Fair warning. We're settling at $2,000. Down it goes. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know I'm in for it. She looks, like, mean and big and strong. Her biceps are, like, ripped. Please be easy on me, I'm begging you. &gt;&gt; AUCTIONEER: Now we're going to offer an opportunity to box Rob Kardashian. Khloe Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe that we're in a room with a bunch of people that are willing to spend money to beat us up. It's just not cool. &gt;&gt; AUCTIONEER: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's auction. We thank you all for coming out and supporting a great cause. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See you all in the ring! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See you in the ring! Now, let's get out of here! &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to box her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't run away, girls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim's person has the biggest arms. &gt;&gt; ROB: What are you talking about? My dude is... &gt;&gt; KIM: She is... Rob's got... &gt;&gt; ROB: Mine's got some bull .. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, you are going to get your ass kicked. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so scary. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Kim Kardashian! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Kimmy! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not what we signed up for! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Big night, baby! Big night! You guys ready for this one? Yes or no? Yes or no? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you that nervous that you're going to act like that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I am, Bruce. &gt;&gt; ROB: I masturbated right before I showered, and they say you're not supposed to ejaculate before a fight. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I'm thinking about mid-fight. &gt;&gt; KIM: I literally have, like, a nervous pee, so I've got to pee. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just keep walking. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. Let's go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're sending helicopters to pick us up at the airport and fly us out to the casino. Let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That easier than driving? &gt;&gt; KIM: That is probably going to be easier than the boxing tonight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Guys, a little time to relax before the big one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The casino is really taking care of us. They gave us a great suite to be able to relax before the big fight. But it seems like, you know what... and probably including me, too-- everybody's on a little bit of edge. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you guys nervous? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just, like, don't care if I win or lose. I just, like, want it to be over. Like, I just don't care. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is Lamar coming? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is Lamar right here on TV. &gt;&gt; ROB: Live. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So he's not coming? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: From Oklahoma. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: Come on in. This is Kim. This is Carol Ann. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; CAROL ANN: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; VALERIE: Hi, I'm Valerie, her mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Carol Ann has cancer. We met her through the Dream Foundation. And her wish is to come and meet me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want Kim to get her ass kicked? &gt;&gt; CAROL ANN: Of course not. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who are you rooting on? Good answer. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so scared. I don't know if I should just, like, fall down right when I get out there and pretend like I just get knocked out, you know. Like, would that be embarrassing if I did that? &gt;&gt; CAROL ANN: I think you'll kick her ass. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; CAROL ANN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. I'll fight, I'll fight for you. &gt;&gt; VALERIE: She is a fighter. She's been fighting for two years now. And she's not done fighting. &gt;&gt; CAROL ANN: I never stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Never stop. Carol Ann has a really rare form of cancer. She's in a wheelchair 'cause she can only walk a few minutes at a time without getting really exhausted. So I know it was a really big deal for her to come out here. And I definitely want to give her a good show. &gt;&gt; MAN: Thank you so much. Thank you for taking the time out to visit with us. &gt;&gt; VALERIE: Bye. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; CAROL ANN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nice meeting you. &gt;&gt; VALERIE: Nice meeting you all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All right, guys, we ready? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, we got to go! &gt;&gt; TRAINER: Good. Perfect, yeah. Just look for the opening. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you need to come up with, like, a poem like Muhammad Ali. Like a little jingle. "Flirt like a butterfly, sting like a bee." And just start saying silly things to them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Flirt like a butterfly, sting like a bee! &gt;&gt; KIM: It's "fly like a butterfly." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what she said, "flirt." &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Shaking in your boots..." &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not going to be my theme song, sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Sting like a bee." &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll just pretend they're you, and then I'll beat them to death. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brought my other son Burt. Rob-- this guy's been training us. &gt;&gt; TRAINER: Nice to meet you, man. &gt;&gt; BURT: Good deal. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; ROB: They call me Rob the Bank. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have to wear one of those things so nobody... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm protecting them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...hurts the goods. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm protecting the goods, hon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; MAN: 192 for Rob Kardashian. Next up, James Taylor. &gt;&gt; ROB: 192, 192. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 192? You fat guy. &gt;&gt; MAN: 214. &gt;&gt; MAN: 214, okay. Next up, Scott... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I thought it was within five pounds. That's not five pounds. That guy's 20 pounds more than you. &gt;&gt; ROB: The guy who I'm fighting weighs 20 pounds heavier than me, but I'm just thinking it's for charity. It's not even that serious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe Kris is right. Maybe I am stupid to go into a ring, you know, with somebody, I don't even know who he is. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: And now, ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome to the ring, fighting tonight out of the red corner, Bruce Jenner! &gt;&gt; REFEREE: All right, gentlemen, remember, this is an exhibition for charity. Good luck to both of you. God bless. Touch 'em up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so scared for Bruce right now. I can't even breathe. He could really get hurt. &gt;&gt; REFEREE: All right, gentlemen, remember, this is an exhibition for charity. Good luck to both of you. God bless. Touch them up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so scared for Bruce right now. I just want Bruce to be known as an Olympic champion, not as this 60-year-old guy who just got beaten in a fight by some guy off the street with a lot of money in his pocket. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm feeling good. I got this guy. He's not that tough, but I got to watch out. He's got a good left hand. &gt;&gt; REFEREE: Time! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce can actually beat this guy. He's doing a great job. And he looks kind of sexy doing it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, round two's coming up right now. Time to have a little fun, take care of this guy. But I have to remember it's for charity; nobody gets hurt. &gt;&gt; REFEREE: Hey, go over there! Three, five, six, seven, eight... Are you okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Boom, came in with the left, put the guy down. I've never done anything like this before. The guy's down; I feel good about this whole thing. Hope he's okay, but I think he is. &gt;&gt; REFEREE: Blue! Fight's over. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, after two completed rounds of boxing, the winner by way of knockout: Bruce Jenner! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! I feel good about myself now, you know? Hey, got through this thing, put the guy down. You know, I'm feeling 25 years old again and pretty darn strong. And thank you all for coming out and supporting the charity. Well, at least this one in the family won! I hit 60 this week. I could be the oldest registered fighter in the state of California. &gt;&gt; BURT: Undefeated. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And undefeated. &gt;&gt; BURT: There you go. We like it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And undefeated! &gt;&gt; MAN: Can I get the attention, Team Kardashian? Let's ready to walk. &gt;&gt; TRAINER: Time to shine. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: And now, ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome to the ring, fighting tonight out of the red corner: Rob Kardashian! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; REFEREE: Gentlemen, I want a good, clean, hard fight. Obey my commands at all times. Touch 'em up. &gt;&gt; ROB: When I first see my opponent, I cannot believe how much stockier and bigger the guy is than me. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo, I do not know what's up with this dude. This is supposed to be for charity, and the guy's, like, coming at me with full force, like, trying to just rip my head off. No jabs, no nothing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, what the hell? I don't know what's going on. Why aren't they stopping this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am stopping this right now because the people who came to fight us want to hurt us. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I'm scared for my life. I don't want to do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to go home! This is really crazy because now he's hitting him when he's down. Robert doesn't even have his face mask on. This is not what we signed up for! &gt;&gt; TRAINER: He's ready to go. He wants to go one more round. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You know, if a real fight is what this dude wants, then that's what I'm gonna give him. &gt;&gt; KIM: They shouldn't let you fight there with your face mask coming off. Don't do it! Don't do it! &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, the referee in charge advised to stop the contest. &gt;&gt; TRAINER: All right, it's done. It's done. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I cannot believe this. The officials are actually stopping the fight because this dude knocked me down with my headgear off. You know, I want to get back in there and fight. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: He looked like he had a real issue with his headgear. &gt;&gt; TAYLOR: The real issue was I knocked hishead off. That's why. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: It didn't even faze me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not that. It's therules. You were on the ground. You were underneath the ropes. He kept hitting you. &gt;&gt; TRAINER: Yeah, that was a DQ right there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right! Also, your mask was off. And then your mask was off for sevenseconds the second time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You should have seen the look in that guy's face. I mean, like, nobody stopped the fight when the thing came off three times. Nobody said anything. This is a kid who's not a professional fighter. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, we're just doing this for charity for fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, this was to raise money. It wasn't to get the kicked out of us. I mean, you know? I am stopping this right now because obviously, the people who came to fight us want to hurt us, and this is bull I'd rather write the check to charity. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The press. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sorry. Sorry. She's gonna get out there and have the same treatment? Nobody's gonna stop it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're gonna do it. They're not gonna fight the same guy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; CAROL ANN: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you guys gonna watch the fight? &gt;&gt; CAROL ANN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who are you rooting on? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll fight. I'll fight for you. So I know that my brother's had some really hard hits, but Carol Ann is sitting in the audience fighting for her life. I just can't stop thinking about how I don't want to let her down. Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I talk to you for a sec? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm scared for my life. I don't want to do it. But I want to do it for her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, if that girl comes at you with that look like that guy did out there... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I don't really want to. I'm scared for my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You fall to the floor and just say, "It's over." &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know what to do. I feel really guilty. I don't want to be like a quitter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I certainly don't want to ruin something for her. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know Carol Ann is out there waiting to watch me fight, and I don't want to be a coward in front of someone that's fighting for their life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But you still look good inside out, Kim. You <i>still</i> look good. Kim's the one stepping up. I mean, she knows this is for charity. She doesn't want to cancel it. We're raising a lot of money here tonight. Good stuff. Proud of you, Kim. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: And now, ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome to the ring, fighting tonight out of the red corner, Kim Kardashian! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I understand Kim feels like she needs to do this for Carol Ann, but this is the last fight. Not one more family member is gonna go in that ring. &gt;&gt; REFEREE: Okay, ladies, you received the instruction in the dressing room. You know what I expect from you; a good clean fight. Touch gloves. Good luck to both of you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Kimmy! &gt;&gt; REFEREE: Light 'em up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Move around, Kim. Move around! Move around, Kim! Move! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Kimmy! Come on, Kimmy! &gt;&gt; REFEREE: Take it easy! Take it easy! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no, not again. I cannot watch one more of my kids get slaughtered out there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa-oa-oa-oa! &gt;&gt; REFEREE: Take it easy! Take it easy! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I've never been hit so hard. I've never been in pain like this before. I mean, I want to take a dive, but I'm not going to. &gt;&gt; REFEREE: You're okay. You're okay. Exhibition, exhibition, exhibition. Let's go. Okay, let's go. Exhibition. &gt;&gt; KIM: This girl is pounding on on me. And I'm starting to get angry. &gt;&gt; REFEREE: Take a little bit off the punches. A little off the punches. ♫ ♫ A little off your punches! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm kinda disappointed I didn't get a fight, but I'm really impressed. Kim looks impressive out there. She's defending herself. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, we go to the judges' scorecards, and all three judges are in agreement, scoring it exactly the same: 20 to 18, all to your winner by unanimous decision... Tamara Thrapacilla! &gt;&gt; KIM: Even though I didn't win, I'm still so proud of myself for just going in there and holding my own. I just hope that I made Carol Ann proud of me. She really inspires me. I swear my rib's bruised. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, Kim. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So proud of you. My little girl! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it, like, really hurts to breathe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? I'm proud of you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It really hurts to breathe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It hurts to breathe? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I saw one shot in there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Twice in the same spot. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Twice? And you got a little swelling right there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know if I could have watched that for one more second. Thank God because now we can all go home. &gt;&gt; KIM: At least I did it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You went through it. At least you did it. &gt;&gt; KIM: All for charity. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All for charity. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like a new woman! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love that! &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's go kick some ass! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love that! You just kicked some ass. Don't! Wait, wait, wait! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, time-out! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're gonna hurt your hand. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We should have done a charity golf tournament. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm all for charity golf, yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right? I mean... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm all for that, but that's tough to organize. I mean, here we just had all the kids. Oh! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bobbo! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Little baby! Look at him. How's little Robbie doing? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you doing good? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah, I'm just real sore. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How's your neck? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah, my neck's... I can't even move. I mean, it's just real sore. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob is resting comfortably. Maybe boxing wasn't the right thing to do for this charity, but it was interesting. It was a lot of fun for some of us, but I don't think it's gonna happen again. All right. It was great. Rest up your wounds, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I hope not. I'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where should we sit? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't this nice? Look at this. "Happy Birthday." It's Bruce's 60th birthday, and I know he's really excited that all the kids showed up to celebrate, especially his sons Burt and Brandon. &gt;&gt; KIM: My first memory of Bruce was it was my 11th birthday party and it was at Tower Lane, and I thought it was so cool that you four: you, Casey, Brody, everyone was coming, and I was, like, "We have four new, like, brothers and sisters, and they're all coming." And that's why it was so much fun 'cause we had such a good time. That it was the best way to kick off our meeting. And we were, like, "You're so cool." And you guys were, like, "You're so cool!" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if you guys were all really lame? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You guys really did a great job at crossing us, you know, having our family and your family and the kids. And I think that a legacy that you guys have left is that we will remain family. And I am very appreciative and thankful for that. I think that deserves another cheer. Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To family! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: To family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so proud of my own family; that we have, through everything, managed to stay so close. You know, we all have really crazy lives and busy schedules, and it just feels so good that we all give back to charity. &gt;&gt; ALL: Yay! &gt;&gt; Next on Keeping up with the Kardashians. I just wanted to spend time with my sisters on this trip. We can't do vacations like this anymore, so itsucks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Our lives are different. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And this isn't how it's... &gt;&gt; KIM: You're having a baby; she's married. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I shouldn't have come in the first place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have never seen Kylie this jealous before. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You guys always favor Kendall, and it's so annoying. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your day'll come.
