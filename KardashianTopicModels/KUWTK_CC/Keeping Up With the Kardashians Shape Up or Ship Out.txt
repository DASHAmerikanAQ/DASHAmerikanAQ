- &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's go look at the baby's room, come on. You think a baby's going to live in here? Let's hope you're redecorating this thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, this is not even normal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is where the clothes go that we can't fit anywhere. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, you're going to have a baby in two months. Two months. It takes more than two months to order a crib. First of all, we need to have the room painted. I happen to think this color is so beautiful. Look at this color. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's a little bright for me. That's, like, a Post-It. That, that's a little more subtle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So beautiful. Do that blue. Do it Aramez blue. And we can call it the Aramez Blue Room. I'm loving this. I think that this is the dresser. That's the flat screen. That's the changing table. That's the crib. And that's a roll-away bed, or a mattress and a box spring. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, done. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The baby's going to be here in less than two months and there's still so much to do. I just feel really overwhelmed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't you just get some stuff done? You think about some stuff here alone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get to work. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need my mom... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just start writing stuff down and figuring it out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...to help me with something. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm all good. Love ya. &gt;&gt; Where is everybody? Don't all rush to meet me. Hey, babe. I'm back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I gave the presentation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, good-- sales force. I love sales forces. They, like, get it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So where's your check? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My check? You mean... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Trying to hold out on me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...like this one right here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, here's the deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hmm? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was thinking about opening up my own account. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your own account? What do you need an account for? Bruce, you haven't written a check since 1972. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, no, that's not the case. It's just every time I turn around, it's like I have to beg you for money. I mean, 20 bucks so I can, you know, get a coffee in the morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Babe, we got you a Starbucks card. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's, like, I don't want to have to go to you every time. I'd like to have my own little account. Kris is so controlling, especially with the money. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just relax. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-kay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm going to go change. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. Do you need 20 bucks? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah, I need 20 bucks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, okay. I'll give you a loan. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you think about this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This seems like I could use this slash holding the baby and also be in a theater room type feel. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: And get pedicures. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Totally, look at this. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do my nails, bitch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys are so annoying. We really need to get all the furniture for the baby's room. And I really need Scott to definitely take this seriously. This bedding is actually really cute. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob, test that. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Get a security... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't be in here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, hold on. I want to show you that I'm going to be a good dad. Watch. Boy, I said no more candy in bed. No. Put it down. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You are a good dad. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm telling ya. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You are a good dad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys are annoying. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How much weight would this hold? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does this come in black? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Will this hold him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come on. &gt;&gt; SALESMAN: I wouldn't recommend it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys, can you go in that room. I'm trying to ask questions. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where are we going to go? Just get in there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. You guys, stop. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You could fit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can't do that. That's so rude and disrespectful; come on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Robert! We're trying to look at stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What if he comes over to babysit? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're just so disrespectful. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What if he comes over to babysit? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's going to get in it? You're so immature. Grow up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Grow up? He's in the... Grow up, "brah." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys are so embarrassing. You're not with me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Embarrassing?! I'm about to spend $1,500 on a crib. I want to make sure Rob can sleep in it, too. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Rob. What are you doing? Oh, Adrienne. Is that your Adrienne folder? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah, it's just every day in India, she would take a different picture. So I was just going through my photos. Adrienne is my ex-girlfriend who I was with for two years. And we lived together. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Please try not to smack me in the face with the box. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: We were very serious. Got tattoos, the whole nine. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I love you. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Love you, too. And, um, we aren't together because I cheated on her. Come-- a couch... &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Okay, Rob. Maybe I'll just go back to New York. &gt;&gt; KIM: You never know what'll happen. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I mean, I honestly... &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, Reggie and I got back together. I mean, we were only apart two months. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah, I understand all you guys ended up getting back together, but, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, Kourtney and Scott, they were apart six months. I mean, you have to follow your heart and figure out, you know? Obviously, right now, you feel like you can't live without her. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah. I just truly do believe that she was the one for me and we were so compatible together. So, I want to open up her eyes so I can show her that and treat her the way she should have been treated. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't worry. It'll-- whatever's meant to be, will be. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. I need to run by the mall and pick some stuff up, so can you get Kendall and Kylie? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not a problem. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Um, by the way, my other 600 helicopter, um, the motor went out on it. I know you're going to go crazy, but, uh, I got to get another motor for it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, all you do is buy gas and helicopters and remotes. And things are burning out and blah-blah-blah. And it's, like, such a waste. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have a good time doing it, so it's, uh-- to me, it's worth it. But anyway, I've got to spend the 500 bucks on it. And also, I want to get a new... &gt;&gt; KRIS: 500 bucks? A new one?! How much is a new one? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want to get the 700 with all the goodie parts in it. I mean, this is my little hobby. I just have fun with this. Used to have big airplanes, now I'm down to little airplanes, you know? And I can't spend a few dollars on them? Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I borrow some money? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have 20 bucks? I'm going to leave. I don't have any more cash. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Here you go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. And I'm going to take the ATM card, so you don't feel tempted. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you're not going to take the ATM card. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to help you out so you don't waste any more money. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, bring that card back! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! I don't want to waste any more money! It's crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just bring the card back! Jeez. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, do you want to help me start doing this crib? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hmm... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need Scott to start taking things a little bit more seriously when it comes to the baby, like getting the room together, reading baby books, just being more involved in what I'm going through. I think that we need to do this together as a team. Where's the bolts? Here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's bolts in here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think I can do this, to be honest. Don't you think we could just get somebody to do this for us for, like 100 bucks? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not about the money. It's just doing it yourself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You think the baby's going to know if I built this or not? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you think this is fun, you can be left alone to do it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Adrienne. It's me again. Hey, A, it's me again. Calling to say hi. I want her to see how much I truly care and how much I truly want to be with her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why aren't you with Kourtney? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look, Bruce, I know how to handle my lady and you know how to handle yours. We'll be just fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nobody knows how to handle Kourtney. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing here? What is this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have a problem. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who knew you had helicopters that big? I thought they started off, like, this big. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, well, see, here's the problem I have, honey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honey? Who--What is happening? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, see, I'm being really nice. Here's the problem I have. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just called me honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm building this bigger one right now. I figured, you know, for 600 bucks, maybe, I could, like, you know, be your little slave. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, so what do you need? I'm just confused. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I just need cash, that's all. If I go back to mom and ask her for, you know, like, more money, she's going to absolutely have a fit. Here's the deal with the old cash flow. Obviously, if I write a check, she sees it. If I put it on a credit card, she sees it. I got to kind of go around her. She kind of controls the books, and that's always a problem for me because I don't have, like, my own checking account. I don't have, like, my own credit cards and stuff like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't have your own credit card? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't even have a credit card. I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are such a little girl. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. I'm a wuss, yeah. When it comes to that stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're a puss. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm a puss. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel so bad that you need to, like, ask me for money. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know. I feel bad, too. How do you think I feel? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, that's so embarrassing for you. I definitely feel sorry for Bruce. And I really want to help him out. I mean, I want him to feel like a man. Like, here's money, buy yourself something, jeez. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're diving in for the cash? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I have $400 on me now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've got $400?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you can go... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, I'm rich. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then if you could take out the trash, and then if you go to Dash, maybe tomorrow or whatever, later today and just... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got a couple more? I love it. All right, I'm gonna go start on my chores. And remember, don't tell Mom, okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your secret is safe with me. Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm trying to... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I see you got started already on doing all the light bulbs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: None of them are working. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, you know, all these little light bulbs I need to be changed. Like, me and Lily can't reach those. There's spider webs all on it and at the very top. Like, that's sick. I can't do that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: You just need a duster. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am the duster. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce is doing a really good job at everything. But I just feel bad even telling him to do stuff. That should do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's been a pleasure doing business with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Any time, dude. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Hey, I'm unavailable to take your call right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, it's Rob. Just wanted to call and say it was nice seeing you at the wedding. Nice talking to you and everything. I've been trying to call Adrienne, trying to make things right, but she won't pick up. Hey, Adrienne, it's me again. Hey, it's me again, uh, Rob. Just wanted to see how your day's going. Uh, it's 9:20. Just calling to say hi. Call me back, please. The reason I'm calling Adrienne so much is just because I want her to see how much I truly care, and how much I truly want to be with her. I want to get my girl back. Hey, it's Rob. I'm just calling you to see what's going on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that the strip club? &gt;&gt; KIM: When did you start to get gray hair? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like last week. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have one gray hair, and in order for her make it all blend, she has to do the whole head. Right, K? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. Will you guys look at this new dress I have in my closet? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? I'm going to an event tomorrow night and I need to make sure that you guys think my dress is cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, Kim and I have told you this before-- you can't buy clothes unless you approve them between us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm asking you to approve. I have 24 hours, okay? It's right over there. Look at the dress. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is it this one hanging right here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yep. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: It is like $4,000. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just spent $4,000 on a dress? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I couldn't find anything else to wear. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, that is ridiculous. Are you kidding? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's crazy. That's way too much money, Mom. You have so many dresses, and it's just a plain black dress. It's nothing special. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't keep wearing the same dress over and over. You have to have, like, something new every time we go to an event. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris is such a hypocrite. Bruce is not allowed to spend any money on helicopters because it's wasteful, but yet my mom can go around and spend $4,000 on a dress that she's only going to wear once. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get out of my wallet, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Credit card... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...credit card, credit card... Ooh, Bruce Jenner's credit card. No wonder he has no money. &gt;&gt; KIM: Capitol One, Wells Fargo... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Put my stuff away. That is not okay. You don't go through somebody's wallet, it's rude and disrespectful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, come on, she's too sensitive. Come on, Kim. &gt;&gt; ROB: To wives and mistresses. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: To goomahs. To you. &gt;&gt; JJ: What were you saying about last night? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you know how many times he called Adrienne last night? &gt;&gt; JJ: 80, I know. &gt;&gt; ROB: Shut up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 70 he told me. &gt;&gt; JJ: If she doesn't pick up after five calls... I want to know where the other 65 came from. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is going on with you and Adrienne? Where are you with her right now? &gt;&gt; ROB: To be honest... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; JJ: I felt like post-wedding, you were really close, and then you screwed it up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I felt like the wedding night he was good, until she woke up the next day and he called her 19 times to see when she woke up. &gt;&gt; ROB: I deny... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sent nine kinds of flowers. &gt;&gt; ROB: I didn't... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's going to send her a dog, by the way. &gt;&gt; JJ: Did you send her flowers? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I did not. Before the wedding. She liked 'em. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bet she did, Focker. What is she going to say, "Hey, by the way, I hated your flowers See you at the wedding."? &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, JJ and Scott are constantly making fun of me, but little do they know, like Adrienne and I have a special relationship. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you think is going to happen at this point? I mean, are you stalking her? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I'm done. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's probably going to have a restraining order before you know it. &gt;&gt; ROB: She understands how I am. She doesn't think I'm crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, she definitely thinks you're crazy. This is an intervention, okay? We're intervening. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm done. If you don't start helping me out and getting on my team, this relationship is done. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is this a joke? Answer my phone. When I call someone, like, answer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who are you calling? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott. I said I wanted to go to this-- to these classes, and like, he doesn't answer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Class for what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like breast pumping. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe that's why he's not answering. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's still rude. I said, "Let's go." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, well, he shouldn't like, ignore you. Call him again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just called like, three times. I don't want to be a stalker. Answer my call. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, that's your baby daddy. You can stalk. Stalk that ass. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've called Scott over and over. He's totally avoiding my calls, and I'm really pissed off because he's totally flaking on me to go to this breast feeding class. I mean, I refuse to go alone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honey, why would anyone want to pump their breast by themselves? I could go with you and give you moral support. I mean, I'm not going to pump your breast, but I'll pump mine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't get it. And I feel like when I go to these classes... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wonder if I can. Can I really be that supportive and pump mine, too? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce told me he's tasted breast milk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce I'm sure has. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How sick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce is just very... &gt;&gt; LILY: By accident? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you going to taste mine, just to see what it tastes like? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Drink your breast milk? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not from my boob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Obviously, you sick &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If I'm... taste it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'll taste it. I'm not sucking on your though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's hope. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Rob told me to bring beers for them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To bring beers for them? What are you, their bartender? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Great. Okay, get them their beers and don't be drinking any of it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, I will. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sometimes I get real disappointed with Scott. Here he's got a pregnant girlfriend, okay? Instead, he's over here with my little Kylie being a little barmaid, bringing beers out there so he can work on his tan. It does not work for me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Having a little brewski, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I'm trying to keep up with you guys. Anyway, why aren't you with Kourtney? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? I mean, I'm always with her. &gt;&gt; ROB: The guy needs a little breather. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's doing some class that doesn't involve me today anyway. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She say she didn't want you to go? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course not. She said she wanted me to go, but... I know. I don't need to go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, well, yes, you do, you need to go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look, Bruce, I know how to handle my lady, and you know how to handle yours. We'll be just fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know how to handle Kourtney? Nobody knows how to handle Kourtney. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I handled her well enough to get her pregnant. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Good luck. &gt;&gt; TEACHER: Hi. How are you? Hi, come on in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't like your baby? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here, you want this one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. I like that one better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like a girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, look at that one's eyes. Khloe, look at it. &gt;&gt; TEACHER: So, hi, everyone. So today we're gonna take you through some of the, uh, basics that you guys need to know, how to take care of these little ones. And we're gonna just, um, talk about and learn about some of the things that you're gonna be doing every day. Um, so I think hopefully it will be useful to you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How many times a day does your baby eat? &gt;&gt; TEACHER: Um, new babies that are breast-fed, eight to 12 times. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; TEACHER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A day? &gt;&gt; TEACHER: Pretty often. Uh-huh, in 24 hours. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Going to these classes makes me more nervous because it just reminds me of all the information that I don't know. &gt;&gt; TEACHER: Put the front of the diaper underneath your baby's tush so you've got a clean surface. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, his two legs like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sorry. &gt;&gt; TEACHER: And have that cloth diaper handy. Everybody got that? Perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you wrap it... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bingo. I don't know how to change a diaper. I don't know how to swaddle a baby. I don't know when you swaddle a baby. I don't know even how to hold the baby. Just thinking about all these tasks and things that I'm gonna need to know just makes me really nervous and anxious. Did you do it? &gt;&gt; TEACHER: You guys, how'd you do? It looks good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think I did very well. &gt;&gt; TEACHER: Okay, let's see. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney's just off right now. I think she's really getting stressed, and the pregnancy's finally starting to hit her and it's becoming more serious. And also, I think the fact that she's the only one without a dad here right now, I think that's really affecting her. &gt;&gt; TEACHER: How are the dads back there feeling about all of this going on? You guys plan to be pretty involved or...? Yeah, he's better than you are. How about the rest of you? Dads involved or...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm the dad today. &gt;&gt; TEACHER: Got it. Good. You're gonna be busy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm. I will still be the dad, even when he is around, I'm sure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. Okay. What are you up to? All right, good talking to you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sick and tired of Scott not putting in an effort with the baby and I. And him not coming to that class was the last straw. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You have a bad attitude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, 'cause you ditched me in my breast-feeding class today. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's a woman's breast-feeding class. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We learned about other things. It wasn't just about breast-feeding! You just don't get it. What are you bringing to the table? Nothing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Everything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nothing! You're not helping with any thing. I'm done. Like, I am sodone with you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, relax. You-you don't mean that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Relax? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, okay... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Test me! test me and see. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Test you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah! If you don't start helping me out and getting on my team, this relationship is done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's my dress? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bitch, I want my damn ATM card! &gt;&gt; KIM: So what's, like, your plan? Like, where are you gonna stay? &gt;&gt; ROB: When I get there, I'm just gonna go get a hotel room and, uh... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just afraid if you go to New York, you'll come back hurt. As much as I don't agree with Rob going to New York, he's my little brother. I'm gonna support him no matter what. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: So I call Rob to see what's going on with Adrienne. &gt;&gt; ROB: I freaked out last night and I called her, like, 60 times, literally, like crazy. Like, more than that. Like, from the house and from my cell. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, you're crazy. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think if I show her that I'm serious about wanting her back, I think she'll come back to me. I don't want to be with anybody but her. I don't want to even date. And I can't just be lonely and single anymore. Literally, every single day, I send her an e-mail or a text. And I'm not talking about just one. Like, "Oh, this just reminded me of you." "I'm so sorry, like, that I treated you that way." &gt;&gt; KIM: I know he feels that she's the one, and I get it, but Rob is taking it to a whole 'nother level. I think that at some point, you just need to stop calling her. And I think this is now, like, the turning point. You have to let it go. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, I'm gonna shower. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scotty. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, he left. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? He just told me to come here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did he really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I figure I'll talk to you then, Bruce, if Rob ain't here. I need somebody to speak to, because, you know, it's all women everywhere. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's nothing but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you got a pregnant one. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not simple, I've come to realize. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're just realizing that now? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She, I guess, asked me to go to some class that I thought I had no part in. Breast-feeding? I thought that's just her. What-what do I bring to the table in breast-feeding? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Support. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I want to be there for her and be sensitive, I've just never been this person before. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott has really lived a very easy life. He's been really very selfish and just kind of dealing with Scott. It's time to give a little bit of advice about being a father. You just got to realize that it's just not about you anymore. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not about Kourtney anymore. It's about this family structure. It's easier now. Because when little guy comes... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's a whole 'nother level. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days out of the year for the next 20 years of your life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm getting to realize that now. Being an only child, I never really did care too much about other people's needs. But I realize, I'm not the most important person anymore, and I can't be selfish. I need to think about my family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All you can do right now is just dote on her, take care of her and just realize that this stage of pregnancy, you just got to get through it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They came with me to look at the... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Kathy comes with us. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yummy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Rob. Kourt, Kim and I decide that it's time to intervene on Rob with this whole Adrienne situation. Thank God you're here, because honestly you have a major problem. &gt;&gt; ROB: What did I do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, you are obsessed with Adrienne. &gt;&gt; ROB: She understands how I am. She doesn't think I'm crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, Robert, she definitely thinks you're crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who wouldn't think someone's crazy if they call them that many times? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is an intervention, okay? We're intervening. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If Rob and Adrienne are meant to be together, they'll be. You don't need to try this hard. I'm over it now. Like, at first, I was like, "Oh, cute, Rob and Adrienne." Like, I'm over it, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: She knows that you love her. What else can you do? There's nothing else you can do. &gt;&gt; ROB: The love that Adrienne and I had doesn't just go away overnight. It's just so frustrating that my own family doesn't even understand their own brother. I don't feel content and, like, at peace. I can't just drop everything and be cold turkey not talk to her anymore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, that's not gonna happen. She went back to New York. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's in New York. &gt;&gt; ROB: Then if I have to go to New York, I'll got to New York. If I look like an idiot-- How much more stupid can I look? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're just gonna go to her house? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm gonna go try and make things right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, honestly, maybe you need to go to New York to open up your eyes that you guys are not meant to be. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I don't agree with that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Enjoy Adrienne in New York, you freak of the week. &gt;&gt; KIM: We should go and get her dress from the dry cleaners and hold it captive until she gives back the ATM card. &gt;&gt; ROB: I've decided to fly back to New York to see Adrienne face-to-face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does she know you're coming? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, she doesn't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where'd these cookies come from? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're Armenian cookies. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's the difference between, like, an American cookie and an Armenian cookie? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: An Armenian made them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, that makes them Armenian cookies? &gt;&gt; KIM: Those pants-- I mean, are you a doctor? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, do you have a washing machine? They're filthy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They are, but I've been working all day, moving stuff for your mother. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you have any, like, balls? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, not with her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Apparently not. They're in the blender. &gt;&gt; KIM: Balls in a blender. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Balls in a blender. Kris already has your balls in a blender. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. Well, what are you gonna do? I'm... I'm scared of her! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honey, she's the one that walked in with a $5,000 all-black basic dress. Like, hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, $5,000 for one black gown. It wasn't even special. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thousands of dollars she paid, for a dress! Are you kidding me?! &gt;&gt; KIM: We've got to get her back. I don't know how, but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe I should trade in the dress or something, huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, I have the best idea! &gt;&gt; KHLOE &amp; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: We should go and get her dress from the dry cleaners and hold it captive until she gives back the ATM card. I really want to help Bruce get his financial freedom back. He's worked so hard. There's no way that my mom should have control over the money. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So we get her dress from the cleaners, and we hold her hostage. I like it. I'm in. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna show Kourtney that I'm gonna be there for whatever she needs, whenever she needs it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Getting this room put together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, that's cute, with the animals there on the blanket. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What about the whole crib is all done? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, no way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I never in a million years pictured myself putting a crib together. I know that I'm doing it for my son, and I'm taking pride in it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's so cute that you put those animals out here like that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just wanted you to be happy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. It makes me happy. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Our mission is to teach Kris a lesson and give Bruce his balls back for life. So, we're here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. We are picking up a dress under "Kris Jenner." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're just gonna take this dress. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can charge it to her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, charge it to her account. Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, got it. Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mission accomplished. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. Should we wait here, or what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, we're gonna wait here. She said she's on her way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I feel like it's, like, we're the cops. We're on stakeout. This is wonderful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is a stakeout. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is the stakeout? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, now that we're playing a waiting game... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I can't see. I'm gonna move up to the front seat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, sorry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, where is she? And I think you should make... Oh, you got the phone call already? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, Kris. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Kris. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here we are at a stakeout, and literally it's been an hour, Kris is still not here, my ass is numb-- I mean, being a spy is really hard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There... she's parking. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh... yeah. You don't need to show 'em that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, call her. Now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris Jenner... we have taken your dress from the cleaners. If you want it back wrinkle-free, you will listen to the following instructions. Do you hear me? Get in the vehicle. Make sure you are not followed. Meet us at the 76 gas station on the corner. Meet us there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Pronto, Tonto. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, I don't have time to dillydally and play these stupid games... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, we don't have time to constantly give Bruce money. &gt;&gt; KIM: Over and out. Be there in five. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Over and out. Be there in five. If not, this dress is losing an entire inch off the bottom. Seriously? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, does she sound pissed. Now we have to rush back to the house and hide the dress before Kris comes home. Get the dress. We've got to hide it before Mom gets home. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I got it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got to be kidding me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mission aborted. You may now go to your house now. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are waiting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you need? &gt;&gt; KIM: Bring a wad of cash. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just hung up on her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, now let's wait it out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We'll just wait it out-- she'll come back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need Midol. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'll wait down here. My God, she's gonna kill me. ♫ ♫ Kris is on her way back. Kris really doesn't like practical jokes, especially when she's the victim. I don't know how she's gonna handle this thing. Aren't you nervous? You guys are, like, not paying any attention. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, we're not nervous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm the one that's gonna catch hell for this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are we nervous? What do we care? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're gonna cut the out of that dress if she tries to pull any crap with us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We've got her driving all over town. &gt;&gt; KHLOE &amp; KIM: Who cares? &gt;&gt; KIM: She stole your ATM card. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is why you're a little bee-yitch and she has your balls in a... in a device. In a thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A vice. It's called a vice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, a vice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There you go. You got it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why are you scared of her? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm scared to death of her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you even have a saus-eege anymore, or did she cut it off? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Eh, what's left of it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you guys serious? Where's my dress? Listen, I've been... I have things to do. I can't play scavenger hunt all day long. I need my dress, because... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hold it! Hold it! Everybody stop! Hold it! Bitch, I want my damn ATM card! &gt;&gt; KRIS: If this is what you really want to do, and if this is what you think is gonna get her to respond to you, then I think you should go. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, what's, like, your plan? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'll probably hit her up when I'm out there. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just afraid if you go to New York, you'll come back hurt. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, wait, no, hold it. Bitch, I want my damn ATM card! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, bee-yitch! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Was that good? Was that good? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not funny. Give me my dress. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Was I standing up to her? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me my dress. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want... Where's the ATM card? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, he's mad now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get my card. Come on! &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you give me the dress first. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See? Wasn't I good? Didn't I stand up to her? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, you're ridiculous... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where's the ATM card? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Give me the dress, and I'll give you the card. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, give him the card... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, don't you dare put those balls back in that vice, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This family is so dysfunctional. We're fighting over a $4,000 Chanel dress. Where's the dress? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Show me... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just show me where the dress is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got to find it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look for it... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go look for it... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? Oh, now I'm on another one of your little scavenger hunts? You go to the cleaners and hijack my dress? You guys are out of your minds. No wonder I drink. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your yappity voice is giving me a headache! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Show me the ATM, and I'll show you where the dress is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. This isn't funny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Give me the card, and I'll give you hints. Give me the card. Give me the card. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. You're really annoying. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Card. Card. Card. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This isn't getting old. Bruce, come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Give me the card. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Where's the dress? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: First of all, here you go-- honey, honey, honey... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...honey, stop, stop. Here's the deal, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If I'm cutting back, you're cutting back, too. Okay? It's just fair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's my dress? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Give me the ATM, and I'll show you where the dress is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll give you the ATM card at the same time you hand me my dress. I'm not handing over the ATM card... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want to see the ATM card. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to see the dress-- and it better be in perfect condition. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Here's the deal. There's the dress. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's the dress, and... where's the ATM card? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is it wrinkled? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it's not wrinkled at all. Ooh, there it is, huh? Okay, I'll tell you what? Ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just give me... give me the dress. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Give me the ATM... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, at the same time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's right, put it out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You better give it to me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I will. It's right here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Swear? Swear? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right here. Fair deal. All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm gonna go to the hobby store. See ya. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! Whoo! Yay! &gt;&gt; KIM: You got your card! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good work, girls! Good work! All right! Good work! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't get so excited-- it has a $2,000 limit! &gt;&gt; ROB: I've decided to fly back to New York to see Adrienne face-to-face and just tell her how I feel, and I know I've told her that hundreds of times, but to really show her and go to her door. I don't want her to move on and start a whole new relationship and forget what we had. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does she know you're coming? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, she doesn't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you going to do, you're just going to show up? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I'm going to show up, Mom, and I'm going to try and make things right instead of just sitting here and being miserable every single day and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know you are, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: And it's not... It's not okay, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: If this is what you really want to do, and if this is what you think is going to get her to respond to you, then I think you should go. &gt;&gt; ROB: I believe that she's the one for me, I truly do. And so, you know, I'm a big believer in that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that you should go tell her how you feel so that you know that you did everything you could to see if this could work out. Rob's always telling Adrienne, "I love you," and "I miss you," and, "I'm sorry." Well, okay, get on the plane and go get your girl. I really do, Rob. I think you're doing the right thing. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott and I go to a Lamaze class together. &gt;&gt; TEACHER: Back labor is when the baby's back of the head is pushing on your maternal spine. So I'm going to demonstrate. Got your tennis ball? Tell me if this hurts, okay? But it should feel nice. You're going to get in there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course. &gt;&gt; TEACHER: All across and you're going to give as much pressure with that ball as she says. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; TEACHER: Everything is gentle in and gentle out. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; TEACHER: So I want you to take a deep breath through your nose. Open your mouth and relax it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I believe that everything's going to be okay. We're both totally on the same page now, and just moving forward in the right direction. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: So, what's, like, your plan? Like, where are you going to stay? &gt;&gt; ROB: When I get there, I'm just going to go get a hotel room and, uh, I'll probably hit her up when I'm out there, and just let her know, like, "Look, I'm out here. I came out here to see you, and like, I'm being for real." &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just afraid if you go to New York, you'll come back hurt. As much as I don't agree with Rob going to New York, I really get what Rob is going through because I used to go and fly to see Reggie when we were broken up. He's my little brother. I'm going to support him no matter what. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, okay. I am just taking Rob to the airport. I'm going to call you as soon as I'm done. Bye. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just got this email from Adrienne. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? What does it say? &gt;&gt; ROB: Wait, pull over. All of a sudden, I get an email. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's going on? Why are you making me pull over? &gt;&gt; ROB: Because I just got an email that's from her. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just got this email from Adrienne. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? What does it say? &gt;&gt; ROB: Wait, pull over. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's going on? Why are you making me pull over? &gt;&gt; ROB: Because I just got an email that's from her. "Don't take this email the wrong way, but this is from the new man in her life." &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. "We're trying to start off on the right note and you're really not making it easy. Her Blackberry goes off every minute and it's you almost every time. I can't imagine what you guys really have to discuss after all this time. It's honestly annoying and unhealthy for our relationship. I respect what you guys had in the past, but according to her, it's clearly over. Thanks, Dogs1." &gt;&gt; KIM: Why can't she have the, like, guts to tell you herself? I'm turning around. Like, you're not even going to New York. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; ROB: You just... &gt;&gt; KIM: On our way to the airport, on our way to the airport, you get an email from him, like, "Sorry." But this isn't the biggest sign? &gt;&gt; ROB: I've done every single thing. I've made myself look like an idiot. I made myself, you know... &gt;&gt; KIM: And that's what you do for someone that you love. You do it and if you've tried everything you can, and they're not, you know, giving you back what you need in return... &gt;&gt; ROB: And it sucks. &gt;&gt; KIM: After you've tried everything, then now you know you have to move on. And this was the biggest sign ever. &gt;&gt; ROB: As hard as it is to let go of the love of my life, I needed to learn that cheating isn't acceptable. I'll never, ever do this to my wife, to my future girlfriend. It sucks so much and I'm, like, in so much pain, but I have to move on and it just... sucks. I just... I'm, like... I just can't believe that, like, I loved her so much. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, we're here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, show me your fabulous toy store, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel really bad. I really didn't look at the big picture of Bruce's spending, so I have the perfect way to make this whole thing up to Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm very excited about this. Don't dampen my enthusiasm. It's like a good pair of Manolo Blahniks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Knock yourself out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Think of it that way. We need that in the house. The kids would like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we don't need that in the house. Okay, show me what the 700 looks like. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, there it is, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you're buying it for me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, great. I'm happy to do that. All right, so how much is this helicopter? &gt;&gt; CLERK: Close to $3,000. &gt;&gt; KRIS: $3,000? &gt;&gt; CLERK: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: $3,000? &gt;&gt; CLERK: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For this-- For this toy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it's not a toy, honey, this is a very sophisticated piece of equipment. I mean, this is like what the pros use. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There you go, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Throw it down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have a good time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You work really hard and you deserve to have what you want and to have fun in life and this is your hobby, so go for it. I think it's cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Okay. I have no problem with that. I guarantee, no matter what I spend here, it's a lot less than what you do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, I think it's good you put your foot down. I think actually, you getting mad at me was actually kind of sexy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got to try that more often. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, you ought to try that more often. Get your toy and let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, thank you. Thank you, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go, baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're so sweet, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. So are you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See you guys later. I promise I won't crash it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, everybody. Thank you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, are we not going to the movies? 'Cause no one's doing anything. I don't get it. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm actually trying to save this movie for this date that I have. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, right. Well, what? When did you meet her? I'm so proud of you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Look, she gave this to me at Katsuya. An Armenian girl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Call me. Violet." With a happy face. So, by going on this movie date, does that mean you are over Adrienne? &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, it's my way of getting over her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I told you. Cutting yourself off from the outside world and, like, waiting for Adrienne, that's never going to do anything for you. So, wait. So that means no movie for us. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, it isn't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're saving it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We could still go, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can I come? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We'll all just go. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, Rob, I'm so happy you're moving on. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's more love out there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There is and it begins with us. &gt;&gt; ROB: With Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, don't go to him. Kylie, pick or choose, now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're mean to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm mean? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Robert would never-- &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, all right, all right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're dead, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Next on <i>Keeping Up With</i> <i>the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: I found the dog walking around in Calabasas. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: She has a condition called pyometra. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't watch that. &gt;&gt; ROB: Just do it, bro. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob moving back in-- not a good thing. Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?! I'm sick and tired of you babying this little kid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't baby him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's 22 years old!
