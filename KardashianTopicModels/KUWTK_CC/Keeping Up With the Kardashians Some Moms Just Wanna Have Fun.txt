- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Right? Look, I'm gonna have someone like this with at all times. Look. So cute with my outfit though, right? We'll match and she'll, like, walk, like, stuck to my leg at all times. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the cutest store I've ever been to. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is cute. Should I get that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look how cute this is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look how cute this is. Okay, we'll look later. We'll look another time, I guess. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt and Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at these. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, look at this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Those are so plain. But, Kourt, look. What's the better one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, they're both nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, look. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I don't know, do you like this ruching down here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's fine. The simple things. That's cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How much longer are we gonna do this? All day? &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't think this is fun? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is fun. I don't like being ignored by you two, but the rest is fun. I think this is very cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like a little bow tie. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is really to die. Literally right away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, this is the second time you guys have done this. Kid shopping. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you want like a fab little... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the third time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She has a lot of of this brand... That's the zero month size. Right away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, it's a black sheep. 33 00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,811 Oh, my God. How ironic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, I talked to Khloe and she said that you had more of those, like, side pains last night. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's just the ligaments, too, expanding. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can you imagine yourself huge? 'Cause I can't. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm kind of huge. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, you're gonna get like this, Kim, here. &gt;&gt; KIM: But it's already, like, sticking out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, we're gonna feed you, so you'll feel better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have to use the ladies' room. All right, I'll be right back. &gt;&gt; KIM: I haven't had these since I was at Jerry's Deli, clubbing at, like, 22. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How old are you are you gonna be when I'm 21? &gt;&gt; KIM: How long till you're 21? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Five, six years. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. So I'll be 38. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There was somebody in the bathroom that just peed really, like, loud and strong for three minutes. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Here you go ladies; enjoy your meal. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, we're eating, and I really don't want to hear about someone's else's pee. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to see who this person is. Oh, my God. It's one of those two ladies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you so obsessed? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you could have heard them peeing for-- I timed it. And then I looked under the stall, and it was somebody's feet. &gt;&gt; KIM: You were looking under the stall? What do you think people are doing to you, then? People are definitely looking under your stall. I would. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Imagine if you saw someone you admired going into the bathroom. You would for sure follow them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think somebody listens to me pee? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I feel like anyone can hear me pee, I get anxiety on another level. &gt;&gt; KIM: If someone knew you were in there, I bet they're listening to see if you'll, 69 00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,520 like, fart. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. I'm just sitting in here eating. &gt;&gt; LEAH: That's what you're supposed to be doing. You're pregnant. &gt;&gt; KIM: By myself. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How's it going? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Brandon and Leah are here to play me a new song from their album, and their album's not finished yet, but I'm so excited that they're playing it for me. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Are you gonna miss this house? &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what? I am. It's been my cozy little house for so long... &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's not that little. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll show you guys upstairs. This is like my sanctuary. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Geez. Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know there's racks of clothes, but none of the clothes in my closet fit me, so I'm like, "Okay, I won't even touch that." &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my gosh. Look at all of these clothes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I put you in a pair of my really high heels? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Put them on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let me find my highest heel. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I don't let her wear... &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, wait, wait, wait. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have to try this one. &gt;&gt; LEAH: This is gonna kill me. Are you kidding? How do you wear these? &gt;&gt; KIM: Brandon, you have to see this. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: There's another closet? Awesome. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Do you like my shoes? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Look at all these... oh, wow. It's incredible. &gt;&gt; LEAH: And you tell me I have too many shoes. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Let's go listen to some music if you want to. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'd love for you to hear it. All righty. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am ready. &gt;&gt; LEAH: ♫ No matter who you are Life goes on ♫ Say it ain't so Say it ain't so. ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: It sounds so pretty. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's beautiful, isn't it? First of all, I love that song. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. I think that's my favorite. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's so pretty, and I love Leah's voice on it. It's like falling in love with her all over again. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Aw, that's cute. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, it's a really beautiful song. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you excited? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I think it's... I think it's ready to go. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I feel like it's almost there. And he wants to kill me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Some people just, like, are perfectionists, and just can't... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. I want to hear it from beginning to end and feel like it's finished. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Leah and I have worked our entire lives on our music. We've really refined our craft up until this point. We're right at the precipice of putting out this first EP, which we've worked so hard on. Now all of a sudden, she's having reservations about it, and I'm just very concerned. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it sounds really finished. &gt;&gt; LEAH: But I could put an outfit together, and I'd be like, "That's amazing," and you'd be like, "That is not amazing." You know? This is sort of, you know, my closet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; LEAH: The music is... that's a really terrible analogy, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, no. I get it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I-I'm ready. Like, I think it's great. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm ready, too. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You hear that? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I promise it will be done one day. At least, I think so. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What the heck is this tiny thing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I forgot I had a crib in here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like you can return this Hermès scarf. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not a scarf, it's a burp cloth. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, who's gonna use a burp cloth like that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney and I are definitely getting a lot closer now that I'm approaching motherhood, and you know I really love her advice and I love all the tips that she gives me. It's really helpful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's cashmere, you're gonna have to dry-clean it every time she spits up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? Kourtney? Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys ready? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's so cute... &gt;&gt; KIM: It is cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys... hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes? Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you guys in your sweats? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are we not going to dinner? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: These are not to play with. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Didn't we all say we're going out to dinner? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We decided not to go to dinner. Did we not tell you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Alber Elbaz gave those to us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is so to die. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello, Khlo. You don't want to hang out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You picked the restaurant. &gt;&gt; KIM: My back hurts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You wanted to go to Nobu. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't want to hang out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, when you do baby stuff, you guys don't talk to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wanted to go out and have a night out. You're really turning into that one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If they wanted to do their baby stuff without me, I would rather have not been invited than be like a third wheel. I'm completely ignored. I could've worn sweats over here, been comfy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I could've just worn a over here and you guys wouldn't know the difference. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, isn't this the person... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's see how long it takes them to notice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tell her to exchange this and donate this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do I want all of this BabyBjorn stuff? Like this playpen. Am I gonna want that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, you guys. Do me a favor. Don't laugh, but somebody's got to go into the bathroom right now and just see if there's anybody in there. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like somebody's gonna listen to me pee. I can't pee if somebody else is the room. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Turn on a water faucet, that'll make you pee. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I hate peeing when it's really quiet. I am so confused by my mom suddenly being terrified to use a public restroom. Like, it's not a big deal, everyone does it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just go with me to pee. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Uh-uh. No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I can't hold it anymore, but thanks for the support. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Should we go mess with her? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, let's go. &gt;&gt; LIZ: What do you mean, mess with her? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's like v-- we're gonna videotape her. &gt;&gt; LIZ: This is her worst fear. You're gonna do it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes! Are you ready? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. 201 00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,417 &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? Not funny. Oh, no. Get out of here! Stop it. 206 00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,097 Not funny. &gt;&gt; MAN: There you go! Nice smile, Kim. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kim. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You look so glowy and pregnant! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You look excellent. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; LEAH: So is that the norm? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. It's annoying. And then I'll get some yogurt, and I'll taste some, and they'll be, like, "She's 500 pounds!" &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my gosh, come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: "She's trying, like, a million yogurts!" &gt;&gt; LEAH: That's so mean. &gt;&gt; KIM: Brandon, you have to hide me. They're, like, trying to take a picture of me, like... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Wow. That's really crazy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that Leah's a little bit curious. If their album were to blow up and success was heightened for them, she wants to know what being famous is about and how it really changes your life. &gt;&gt; LEAH: That's intense, though. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. Truly, I feel bad for them that that's their job. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I feel bad for you. That this is what you have to deal with every time you leave your house. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, you have to have a thick skin for it. Like, not everyone can handle, like, the scrutiny. &gt;&gt; LEAH: So is it something that you've gotten used to? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you get used to it, but I think, like, it doesn't matter. Dude, can you, like, move? Hold on. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Now she's mad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you come here? Give us a second. I'm so nice to you all the time. I look into... &gt;&gt; MAN: Are you filming me now? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we are. &gt;&gt; MAN: You're filming me right now? You can't... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we are. Yeah, just like you film me every day. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right, you can't use that, though. &gt;&gt; KIM: We can. &gt;&gt; MAN: No, you can't. &gt;&gt; KIM: You use pictures of me. We can blur your face. &gt;&gt; GUARD: Step away, man. &gt;&gt; MAN: Blur my face then. &gt;&gt; GUARD: Step away. Step away. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's, like, "Are filming me? Are you filming me? You can't film me." &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's like bullying in a lot of ways. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's totally bullying. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It is. &gt;&gt; LEAH: The only thing that freaks me out is just, like, how little privacy you really have. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. People don't expect you to want privacy. Like, when you're so open for so long... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...they think, like, "Oh, you want privacy? Like, who do you think you are?" &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, yeah. They think you want to be photographed all the time. &gt;&gt; LEAH: As in, you signed up for this sort of thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: My life is quiet, and it's peaceful, but Kim has had a lot of success, and what has come with that is a lot of chaos, and that really scares me. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is tough. Like, I'm not gonna lie. You just have to be ready for it. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Shall we? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yes. &gt;&gt; MAN: There you go. Nice smile, Kim... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's crazy. 272 00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:26,286 &gt;&gt; LEAH: It really is crazy, though. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't pee in there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't pee. What are you guys, playing games with me and taking my picture under the stall? Come on, Kendall, I have to pee. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's a red light. What am I supposed to do? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Stephanie? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! You guys, stop messing around. My bladder is about to explode, and if they don't get me to a restroom, stat, I'm gonna pee in the car. Oh, no, no. It's a car wash, Kendall. If I see the water, I'll pee. Now, go! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do you see it sprinkling? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go! I do. Stop! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, you're messing with me. Just go! I have to pee! What do I owe this little dance to? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My sisters-- they don't talk to me. They don't do anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wouldn't you like to hang out with me a little bit more? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if I don't want to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna love me all over again. You're freaking me out, Kylie. Stop it! Oh, I'm gonna kill 'em. 296 00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,812 Kendall? Kylie? You guys are dead! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, let's hurry. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're here. Chill. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God. Do you have a clicker? Kendall? Kendall, open the garage door! I have to pee! : I can't wait anymore. I've got to pee. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Don't tell me you're peeing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nothing. Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Was that you banging on the door? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. : I just had to pee... 310 00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:19,299 in the bush. Don't tell anybody. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, Leah, we have something in common. &gt;&gt; LEAH: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: We both have French-tipped toenails. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hey, look at that! &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought it was only a ghetto thing. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You guys are like twins. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: So Ryan told me that he called you guys to do that, like, acoustic weekend thing. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Mm. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's so cool. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I don't know if we're gonna do it, though. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I kind of feel like we're just not ready yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ryan Seacrest had this idea to book them to do this acoustic performance for his Web site, and then I hear that Leah kind of wants to back out of it. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I just feel like I want the album to be closer to finished before we start booking all of these things. I don't know. I just feel like that's what needs to happen. &gt;&gt; KIM: People sometimes just have a good single and put it out, and they don't even have an album ready. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I feel like there's so many tweaks we need to be making on the music. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's like we can tweak forever. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Mm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, exactly. Even with Kanye with his music. He'll listen to it... He'll change it a million times and listen to it over and over, and even when it's on the radio, he'll think of some... "Oh, shoot, I should have, like, done this." &gt;&gt; LEAH: But I really want it to feel finished. We're just not ready yet. He wants to kill me. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No, I just want to take every opportunity. I don't want to... &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you ever ready? Like, seriously. You're never ready for anything in life. That is what I decided. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'm gonna go crazy if we don't put some stuff out. I really... I am. 347 00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,859 &gt;&gt; LEAH: Okay, well, I'm gonna feed Vince. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mother? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's my cutest daughter? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Jazzercise. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do I owe this little dance to? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm depressed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you depressed? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause my sisters. We were supposed to go to dinner, all three of us. I go over there, and they're in sweats looking at baby stuff, and they completely forgot to tell me they were cancelling the night, and they just wanted to stay in, so I was a little irritated. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They've just been ignoring me. They're so far up their own asses, talking about baby stuff, and, like, every baby store we go to, they don't talk to me, they don't do anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Well, here's the good news. Guess who you can hang out with. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can go hang out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't have the best memories of going out with my mom one-on-one. The last time I think I went out with her, I had to drive her home 'cause she was too drunky monkey. So I'm not that excited about going out with my mom, but she's pretty excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wouldn't you like to hang out with me a little bit more? I'm not having any babies. Those days are long gone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if I don't want to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna love me all over again. I think I could really use a 378 00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:19,812 night out and some fun out with my Khloe; my new best friend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: The video of you peeing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. You haven't seen this? You're gonna die. First of all, why do you sit down on the toilet? Why don't you squat? You're in a public bathroom. Go look on their blog. 388 00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:48,608 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whose blog? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall and Kylie's. You have to see it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: &gt;&gt; KIM: You're gonna die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get under. You're freaking me out, Kylie. Stop it. Not funny. Oh, I'm gonna kill 'em. Kim, I'll call you back. Kendall? Kylie? You guys are dead! This is not funny. Not funny at all. To be silly and play games and make jokes is one thing, but to post a video of me on a toilet? I mean, seriously? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think you're overreacting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What...? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is this gonna matter to your life? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: In a week? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It matters to me right now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You have an issue and you need to get over it. We're trying to help you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Just put it out there and say, "This is what I do. I'm a human being. I urinate, too." &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is not... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do you realize what I'm saying to you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You'll be over it in two seconds. This is us helping you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not funny. I'm pissed! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I-I can't even... I can't. I... You guys are out of line, out of 414 00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,882 control, and I... You're grounded! Get ready, Khloe! We're going out! Cheers. Oh, what's going on in this world? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No more tequila for her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Are you fearful of, like, rejection? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I just feel so scared of what could potentially come from it. 424 00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:28,174 Really that's the most important thing to me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, come in here. Kylie is way more confident than me and Robert... &gt;&gt; VICTORY: No, you're gonna be fine. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ...so I feel like she will sing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I brought in Pia, who's a phenomenal singer. She's gonna kill it and just make this what it needs to be. I do feel a little bad that my mom is so pissed off about the video, so to make up, me and my friends and Rob and Kendall are going to our friend Victory's house to make a pee song for her. &gt;&gt; JUICY J: This is a piss record? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JUICY J: About somebody pissing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; JUICY J: Amazing. &gt;&gt; PIA: ♫ Mommy I want you to know ♫ It's okay to go, go, go It's okay to go, go, go. ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Pia is one of my really good friends. She's an amazing singer, so I called her to help us with the song. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ♫ Let's do this Let's do this Let's do this. ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ♫ I've been peeing Since the day of birth ♫ But my mama uncomfortably Urinated on this earth, Earth... ♫ No, we got to redo that. That is not gangster. &gt;&gt; PIA: ♫ Know &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ♫ I want you to know Know, know, know ♫ That everybody goes Goes, goes... ♫ After rapping on this song, this has made me think I should definitely stick to modeling, never become a rapper. My dreams are crushed, but, oh, well. I mean, what are you gonna do? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall, that was great. I'm so proud of you, Sis. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. 458 00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:07,673 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're done! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can we go eat? &gt;&gt; DON: Hey, sweetie. How are you? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi! You made it! &gt;&gt; DON: I did. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Up until I was 11 years old, I had no idea that my dad was in a band, having never been to a concert before. And he walks up to the front of the stage, and the spotlight hits him on the back, and he starts up with "Hotel California." My dad has been in the business for a really long time, and I've been creating some resistance with putting this EP out. And I feel like I just want to talk to him and get some advice. &gt;&gt; DON: So what's going on? &gt;&gt; LEAH: As you know, we've been working on an EP for years, and now it's getting time to put it out. &gt;&gt; DON: You finished it and mixed it and everything? Are you...? &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's not finished yet. There's still notes that I have. Obviously, getting this one album out, it's not, like, "Oh, my God, yes!" Like, Grammys! Like, you know, it's not like that. It's all obviously a process. And now that we're coming to the point where I'm putting this out, I really have to figure out and take a look at why I'm feeling the way that I'm feeling and why I haven't, you know, done this earlier. &gt;&gt; DON: When we were making records in the Eagles, we would spend days looking at one word. &gt;&gt; LEAH: If I'm being totally honest with myself, I think it goes beyond being happy with the product, because I think, a long time ago, I was happy with the product. I'm happy where my life is right now, and... ...I honestly think that sometimes I've seen, um, success really change people. Not for the better. Not for the better at all. &gt;&gt; DON: The success of money and fame and fortune can change somebody dramatically, and 492 00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,891 you're right to be cautious about that. &gt;&gt; LEAH: When I think about everything and think about what could potentially change, it's so frightening. The most important thing to me in my life is my relationship with Brandon, and I feel like the moment that we put ourselves in the crossfire, it could be the end of everything that I love right now. &gt;&gt; DON: I just don't worry about you or Brandon. This relationship has been in existence long before, and will be in existence long after the success or failure of this record. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I got her phone. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Upload the song to it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, you guys, have you seen my phone? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, we have it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have my phone? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We have a major surprise for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why do you have my phone? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We wanted to say sorry for posting the video online, so this is our way of saying sorry. Play it, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ♫ What up? Okay, kay, kay Let's do this, let's do this...♫ &gt;&gt; PIA: ♫ Mommy I want you to know... ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's Kylie's friend. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's Pia. &gt;&gt; PIA: ♫ It's okay To go, go, go... ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ♫ I've been peeing Since the day of birth, birth ♫ But my mama uncomfortably Urinated on this earth ♫ Earth, earth You got to get rid ♫ Of the toxins And quickly pee ♫ So you can go boxing, boxing Even Ken pees like me ♫ Pees like me Don't be afraid To drink all that tea... ♫ &gt;&gt; PIA: ♫ It's okay To go, go, go... ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Take over, Sis. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are crazy. &gt;&gt; PIA: ♫ It's okay To go, go go. ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ♫ This is Urination nation ♫ Urination nation This is no time ♫ To be patient Time to be patient... ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm really proud of you guys, actually. Did you write the words? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We-we did. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And we made it for you 'cause we want you to know that it's okay to go, go, go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Play this when you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have to pee? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do you have to pee now? You can practice it. And, like, play it loud, so when you're in public, it'll take away the... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no one will hear me pee... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You don't have to, like, turn... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...'cause they'll be listening to your rap. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got you. Okay, I'll give it a try. I actually have to go to the bathroom, so it's perfect timing. I really can't stay mad at Kendall and Kylie, because they have a lot of love. And it's so cute that they wrote that song for me. &gt;&gt; PIA: ♫ It's okay To go, go, go... It's okay to go, go, go... ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's peeing! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She did it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Holding your pee is no way to live life, so I'm really happy that my mom is enjoying our pee song, and it's actually working for her. I mean, you got to just go with the flow. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How do you it's a success? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She was actually peeing. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How's it going? &gt;&gt; LEAH: I'm good. Just thinking about things, and I think I finally figured out the way that I feel. It's just a scary thing, you know. We've been working on this for a really long time. And we haven't put anything out. And I know that there's a reason behind it, and I kind of feel like, the reason has been me, and that I've just sort of, like, been putting on the brakes. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Are you fearful of, like, rejection, and is that what it is? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Um, I just feel so scared of what could potentially come from it. I think about my life, and I remember when I was 16, my parents got a divorce, and I don't want my priorities to switch. And I feel like I've seen a lot of people in my life-- their priorities switch after they've gotten a lot of success. Getting to know Kim over these past few years-- her life is as public as it can get. And I'm starting to think of my life, and I'm not totally sure I want to see it changing in that way. Really, you've become my family. Like, honestly and truly, you've become my family. And really, that's the most important thing to me is you, and not my music. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We could play practical jokes on people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: TP! Khloe, where thedid you you go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Throw me the toilet paper. 583 00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:36,595 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh.Shh. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Honestly and truly, you've become my family, and, really, that's the most important thing to me, is you, and not my music. And I'm afraid of success and having a lot of pressure put on our relationship for what it might do. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Baby. &gt;&gt; LEAH: That's how I feel. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, give me a hug. &gt;&gt; LEAH: And I'm sorry, babe, 'cause you've been working your ass off... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's okay. But you want the same thing that I want. The reason why I work my ass off is because you work your ass off, too-- we both do. No matter what happens in our lives, I know that on my end, I care about our relationship enough to... fight any battle. You know, and I believe that you feel the same way. Judging that you're crying and telling me how important it is to you, I think that you probably feel the same way. Part of the process of getting through this stuff is just being bold and putting stuff out and going for it, you know? I mean, really, life is too short to be fearful of anything. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah, I agree. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Good. &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's not fair what I'm doing. Really, I'm just being afraid. But how are you ever supposed to do anything meaningful in life if it's not gonna scare the hell out of you? This is something that I need to do. I love you. 610 00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,877 &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get ready, Khloe, we're going out! This is your lucky night! I'm really excited, because Khloe's been feeling a little left out lately, so I'm gonna show her a really great night on the town in Los Angeles, and have some fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is, like, the coolest outfit I've ever worn. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. 620 00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:32,544 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, here's your hat. Let's go. Let's go get a margarita. Salud! Arriba... ...abajo... ...abajo... ...al centro... ...al centro... ...pa' dentro. ...pa' dentro. Es la verdad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it means you're horny. Hey! This is gonna be a long night, so just buckle your seat belt. Cheers. Uno mas, por favor. Uno mas. Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She was born in 1922. Doesn't she look good? &gt;&gt; MAN: Definitely. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got a boom-chop-a-gah-gah-gah. I just think we have to do something really crazy tonight. What did you used to do in high school? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I used to sneak out and sleep with older men. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're not gonna do that tonight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just a joke. Ha-ha. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We could play practical jokes on people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Somebody who has no sense of humor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like Kim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim has been ignoring me. Hello? Hole in one. We could TP her house or... &gt;&gt; KRIS: TP! We're gonna TP her house. What's going on in this world? It's gonna be amazing! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, no more tequila for her. &gt;&gt; BARTENDER: No more tequila. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In order to TP Kim's house, my mom and I have to stop at the drugstore and buy toilet paper, shaving cream and Silly String. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is what I like about these glasses. : 'Cause we can multitask. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We all like to get wild and crazy, but we don't want to get kicked out of the drugstore, and my mom is just opening up toothbrushes and brushing her teeth. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, dude... let's reel it in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, where the did you go? Okay, welcome to the double-oh-sevenmission. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom.... Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? Not b... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Reel it in. Seriously. Mom... Do it, and I promise you I'll... I'll punch you in your face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sure. What? Oh. Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. Do you want to do it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't, don't, don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Then don't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are so mean. You are really annoying. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You think I'm annoying? What are you gonna do when the baby's crying? &gt;&gt; KIM: My kid will not cry like that. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, yeah, your kid's gonna be, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna wake up Kanye and be, like, "Babe..." We already have this whole thing planned. In order to be a good girlfriend I'm gonna need some sleep, so he's gonna be on diaper duty in the middle of the night. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm just preparing you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do we need our sombrero? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Just checking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How do we get inside? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look, she's gonna see us going in. Okay, here. Khloe, give me a leg up. Oh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... Oh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No... 688 00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,949 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need a leg. I need a... Why? Okay, okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom... shh, hide. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, just throw me the toilet paper. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me in, you idiot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe... Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never knew how much fun this could actually be. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, Khloe, stop. Give me a roll, I'm not done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get in the car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me the toilet paper roll. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom. Get down. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who TP'd my house? I am so pissed. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Look at this place. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't find this funny. On my roses? In my trees? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, just throw me the toilet paper. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me in, you idiot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's time to change the diapers! You should do a line of designer diapers. &gt;&gt; KIM: Jessica Alba has the company. They have, like, little skulls on them and little hearts... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and, like, they look really, really cute. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is like an art form. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I knew my mom was crazy, and I was kind of hesitant about tonight, but I never knew how much fun this could actually be. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... this is the best day of my life. Oh, my God, Khloe, stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am having the best time. Mom, let's go to the front of 721 00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,348 the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's go, let's go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me the roll. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I swear to God, I will leave you. Get down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get down and get in the car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, come on. Let's go. We're out of here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Towanda! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We love you, Kimmie! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Who's honking? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You have people coming to your house honking in the middle of the night like this? This is not normal. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my cameras. I love doing this. Every night, I get so scared. Who TP'd my house? Who TP'd my house, for reals? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I have no idea. Why are you asking me? I'm here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just not in the mood for this. Like, my boyfriend's coming into town. He'll be here at any minute. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so pissed. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Then you're gonna be even more pissed. This is like... &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't find this funny. 747 00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,940 On my roses? In my trees? &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Brandon and Leah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: The day is finally here. We're releasing our EP. This is a really, really big moment for the both of us. Cheers! &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a joke. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Am I, really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. And hot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, the fact that you literally vandalized my home... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We were celebrating her 757 00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,827 having someone to hang out with, because you guys ditched her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was amazing. I could've been there for hours. Do you think she'll know it's us? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did write your name on the gate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: With my cell phone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did write your name on the gate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: With my cell phone? : Wait... did you make a mess... in my hair? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I did write your name on the gate with, uh, shaving cream. 769 00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:33,098 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love myself. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Aw,, it's all over me. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is wood, so you can't wipe that. You can't wash my gate. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Guess you don't want to come out here. This is sick. Your mom did this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, it's not funny, and they better clean it up. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Your mom is really sick. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, no. This is not normal. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What kind of... who does this? What kind of woman does this? This is like... I haven't seen Mischief Night this bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't, like, people's homes and stuff. It's not nice. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is one of the best things I've ever seen. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm furious, you guys would do this to my home! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: That's vandalizing someone's property. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, it's your family, we're not... &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...vandalizing your property. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't care. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim's reaction to the TP'ing is terrifying. She is so uptight. Like, live a little. It's toilet paper! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, I'm sorry for that, and, um... I will take the blame. Huh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know why it hurts my feelings she's so mad. I didn't mean to make her mad at all. I thought it would be more fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look good, though. I could never pull that off. 802 00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,658 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have such a stomachache. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Whatever you had, it was good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She drank so much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just kind of want to crawl up... and just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, do you want to sleep here? We have, like, five rooms. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, do you want some bread or something? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bread? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can make you some rice or... toast. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Best night ever, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was a little sleepy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I'm gonna say, "So sorry, all of your e-mails went to spam." &gt;&gt; KRIS: They did? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I just didn't reply for like, a week. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's always a good answer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you still recuperating? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have the biggest hangover since high school. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, you had a lot to drink. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't remember half of the stuff we did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You remember toilet papering Kim's house? And shaving cream, and Silly String... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, we used shaving cream? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, and you, like, doused me with shaving cream in the drugstore, and, like, the guy... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...and, like, you were brushing your teeth with a Dora Explorer toothbrush in the aisle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, wait... Oopsie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We went kind of out of control. Like a li-- I mean, a little overboard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney and Kim are downstairs, and they're waiting to talk to us, I think. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney has to chime in at all times. Let's go, let's face the music. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want her to yell at us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, just say you have a really bad migraine. Wear sunglasses or something. Make them feel bad for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a really good plan. Okay, you do all the talking. And say it was your fault. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, guys. 844 00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,886 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What the is wrong with you? Captioning sponsored by Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, guys. 849 00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:31,219 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What theis wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a joke. Like, the fact that you literally vandalized my home... If I put toilet paper and shaving cream and silly cream all over your house... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna have kids. That's what kids do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, get used to it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom's house gets toilet papered all the time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but a kid, not a mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I admit that maybe Khloe and I got a little carried away last night, but it's toilet paper and shaving cream. It was just good, clean fun. Really clean fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You weren't being vandalized. I'll show you being vandalized. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That wasn't being vandalized. &gt;&gt; KIM: If I wanted to call the cops on you guys, I could have, and you guys would have been arrested. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We were celebrating her 867 00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:14,161 having someone to hang out with, because you guys ditched her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can't we just all get along and have fun together? What happened to those days? &gt;&gt; KIM: Poor Jonathan and I had to spend two hours... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Jonathan loves it. He was e-mailing me all night. Do you want to see my e-mails? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What else would Jonathan be doing? He would be fingering your if he wasn't cleaning up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to hang out with Jonathan. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you, like, slap-happy drunk? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I swear I'm still buzzed. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel really bad that Khloe feels left out. We love Khloe. Like, I appreciate her so much. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh! Stop it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't mean to do it that hard. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow! Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I worked out. I'm sore. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo, I love you and I don't want you to feel left out ever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's your bath like Penelope. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not gonna come and jump with you guys and get in the bath, but... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But look how cute she is. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Open wider. Kourtney, we're back together. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: The day is finally here. We get to release our EP. Leah is on board. I am about as excited as I can be and I'm just really looking forward to tonight. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Thank you for coming, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Of course!

I'm so relieved. There's no nerves left. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, David! Good to see you, David. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Thank you for coming, David. &gt;&gt; DAVID: It's my pleasure. I can't wait to hear you guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brandon's got to write me a song-- I've been telling him this for two years. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: He wants his own song, it's true. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Why don't you guys go make some music? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, we're going to. We're actually going to right now. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Brandon and Leah! &gt;&gt; LEAH: ♫ It's the boom, boom boom, it's the beat of the drum ♫ The hot, hot, hot It's the heat of the summer... ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so excited they decided to go for it and put this out.

None of this will faze you. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: This will be just, like, something fun, like a phase in your life that you guys will be like, "Oh, that was fun." I'm just really proud of her. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Thank you. That's very sweet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Love you, too. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. Do you know of any houses for lease for Kim? She needs to get on it now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would think she'd just move into our house. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want privacy for me, my boyfriend, our baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Move in with me. It's so much easier. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need help building the crib. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's coming together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, you don't do any of this at our house. I'm happy that you're helping her... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I don't think you are. 'Cause if you were, you'd say, 950 00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:42,470 "Oh, wow, that's great." I can't really win with you.
