- &gt;&gt; KIM: St. Barts is so beautiful. I've always wanted to come here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look how pretty it is. This is beautiful! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's our first all-girls trip. Kylie's on her way. Where's Kylie's room? I'm really excited to, like, do weird, random, adventurous things together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aah! &gt;&gt; KIM: You know Tyga's coming? He's, like, joining the family vacay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, that's a little annoying. I thought this was gonna be an all-girls trip. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Want to come, T? At this point, I can't do anything about Kylie inviting Tyga on the trip. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just found this girl's Instagram. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So Scott's with two girls? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: People keep telling me all this information I don't even want to know, but then, you know, it's like how can you not look? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's that chick? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. We've been investigating. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Once you start cyberstalking someone, constantly checking someone's page, it becomes so unhealthy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This guy. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, you little pieces of I dare you to come in this room. Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you really thinking you're gonna hit something that way? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna get these suckers if it's the last thing I do. I've never had so many bites on my body in my life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, yeah, me, too. It's, like, disgusting. ! You can hear it, you guys, when they die! , that scared the out of me. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Mom! Hey, Mommy. Mom! Can I see the mermaid? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mermaid? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: She's not here yet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: P, is that true? &gt;&gt; KIM: They have, like, a real mermaid that comes and swims in the pool with them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know there's not such a thing as a real mermaid, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a girl that, like, obviously has a tail and, like, probably shells and, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There actually are real mermaids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's real mermaids? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why would people, like, think that there are? They've obviously seen them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you delirious? Do you think there's real mermaids? &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe once upon a time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, they're still there. Do you know how big the ocean is? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You think there's real mermaids swimming around out there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There obviously are. I'm just feeling kind of ugly. I need to start exercises on my stomach. I want to get that Pilates Cadillac. Do you know what that is? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to get a Pilate machine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But the... I want to get the... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, all you do is when someone says they want to buy something... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Or-or somebody says, "I have a crazy disease," then you say, "Oh, my God, do you know that that happened to me when I was..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, you want to know something interesting? I didn't hear from Scott once from Wednesday to Sunday, and then he wrote me yesterday. Supposedly, I think he was landing in Mexico last night at, like, 11:00 p.m. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where did he go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: To Joe's. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, and Joe kept saying, "No, you can come alone. You cannot come with girls." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: As much as Kourt wants to act like this is so easy for her to hear that Scott is hanging out with random chicks, Kourtney is great at pushing down her feelings. But I know it gets under anyone's skin. How could it not? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Joe said, "Apparently he's staying in a hotel. I hope this is a wakeup call for him. We have a room ready for him and him alone." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wrote him yesterday. He won't even write me back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, who cares? Don't write him anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm calling him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. No. No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okeydokey. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're out of here. Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie! Come here! Look! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie and I have been talking about doing FlyDive for so long. So I'm excited to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! Oh, he's like a real animal. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He's fearless. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, who's up? Once you've made a turn, point your toes a little, bend your knee a little, and that'll get the board underneath you. So then just stand up straight and you'll go straight up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First time! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at Tyga. Oh, boy. Oh, oh. What was that move? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love having T around because he just always wants to have fun, and I'm so glad I get to experience this with Tyga. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good job! You guys did so well. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Great job, Tyga. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: T, that was so fun. &gt;&gt; TYGA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's so annoying, 'cause I literally waited for Kylie for 30 minutes to do the fly thing, and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What happened? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She just, like, took too long with T. And we couldn't do it, which is so annoying. It's kind of annoying, 'cause I was really looking forward to being with Kylie on this trip. And it's not even about Tyga. It's more that just I know she'll kind of be taken away from me. It's just so annoying, 'cause I planned to do it with her. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, you actually swam? Was it fun? I told Mase we have to do swimming at home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, yeah. It's so beautiful. You can do, like, an afternoon movie, like your... the movie night you want to do and have a movie night and night swimming. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. And, like, you know, trying to give all my attention to the kids... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just don't push all your emotions to the bottom. 'Cause you need to be happy, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. I'm just gonna say, "Okay," and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just telling you to keep an open mind. Would be kind of cool if you ever went on a date. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am, like, not a dating person. I did the dating thing before Scott for, like, a minute, and it was so not for me. I just got out of a nine-year relationship. I think the last thing I probably need is anybody in my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you see yourself with somebody else at some point one day? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I'm not, like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, in your mind, do you think, "I can't wait to meet the one"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not really. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think the one is Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I did. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really, really care for Scott, so it's definitely heartbreaking for me to see everything crumble. He's the father of my grandchildren, and it's inevitable that Kourtney and Scott will be in each other's lives forever. So I want him to be strong and to get better. And I think that it would be nice if they had a fresh start. Well, as long as you keep your heart open, even just this much, just a crack, just leave a little tiny crack open in the door. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There's this photographer, and I want to set him up with Kourt. I just don't think Kourtney realizes how bomb she is right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She is just, like, on and poppin' right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It might be a really good idea if you'd spend a little bit of time with Kendall on this trip. Just for a minute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She's so annoying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott? I haven't seen Scott since months ago. So I'm surprised to see him. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at these mermaids. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You guys are so pretty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you guys know that a real mermaid is coming tonight and she's gonna swim with us? Maybe we could even swim with her, too, and go night swimming. Would that be fun? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Turn around. Show Mommy. Cheesy. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Cheesy. Say cheese, cheese. &gt;&gt; NORTH: Cheese, cheese. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Cheesy. &gt;&gt; NORTH: Cheese, cheese. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, girls, let's go. Mason, look, did you see I found two little mermaids? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Look at... You could do this and get-and get down. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do this, and then I want to just be laying right here, okay? Should I lean down like this? &gt;&gt; TYGA: Yes, love it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, this is good. ♫ ♫ She's 18 now! Lift up. Yes, that's pretty! More, more, more, more, more. &gt;&gt; TYGA: I like that. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God, yes. Yeah? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, super cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How the hell do you have that many selfies? Kim and I get into fights all the time because she's constantly taking selfies. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I feel like you used to take more, though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, on my way to jail, Kim's taking selfies of herself. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know, it's the best thing and Mom goes, "Kim, stop taking pictures..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, and Mom says, "Kim, your sister's going to jail." &gt;&gt; KIM: Pass me my computer. I got to show you those pictures. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You have them? &gt;&gt; KIM: I found them. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How were you in jail... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, look, that is the selfie that I took of myself on our way to jail. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa, oh, Kim. When I was in jail, Kim came in with her baby pink camera and was videotaping me. Kim was laughing and she's like, "Are you with people?" And I was like, "23 other girls." She was like, "What? Okay." &gt;&gt; KIM: This is Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So cute, look at her. Sometimes I don't think Kourtney gets how, like, hot she is. The revenge body-- as I know-- is the best body. &gt;&gt; KIM: She can Instagram a good pic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Or do a selfie book. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She should do her new... she should take over your selfie book. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um, so there's this photographer on the island that's really good. He's shot a lot of people and I want to set him up with Kourt. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, set him up, like... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, like, to shoot her. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're all here and we should just kind of try to distract Kourtney and just do what we can to get her mind off of everything. I think if she just did a photo shoot it would make her feel good, it could boost up, you know, her self-esteem a little bit. I just want her to live in the moment and, you know, take this trip for herself. So you know this guy? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know of him. I just don't think Kourtney realizes how bomb she is right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agree. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And I think a photo shoot will help her realize. I just want to make her feel good, she deserves it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She worked hard, too. Like, I was so proud of her. Like, it's so hard to work out. Like, so hard. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I can't imagine, like, when you have that many kids? She is just, like, on and popping right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, she is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just keep saying, like, she came out of nowhere. Like, I wasn't really expecting that out of her. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's, like, literally, all of a sudden, she sideswiped me. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tyga, do you want some coffee or something, honey? &gt;&gt; TYGA: No, I'm just gonna wait till we go eat lunch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Kylie, can I ask you a question? Or just say something to you. It might be a really good idea if you'd spend a little bit of time with Kendall on this trip. She misses you. She misses your relationship. And she's been on the road. Like, just for a minute? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She's so annoying. I used to always have Kendall by my side and now she's always gone and I feel like T. and I just grew a great relationship and now he's... it's more of, like, my comfort zone. Like, I just love having him around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just think about it. I'm not telling you what to do, I'm just telling you to think about some of the stuff I tell you. I don't want you to hate me 'cause I make one suggestion. It's a little intense. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She is so cranky sometimes. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Tell me about it. &gt;&gt; TYGA: I mean, yeah, you just got to have patience, 'cause, like, like you said, she has her mind made up how she wants things, you know? You can tell her, but it can go, like, one ear, out the other. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TYGA: And then, maybe later, a week from now or two weeks from now, she'll be, like, "You know what, you were right." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: If, even in the moment, if she's like, if you tell her something and she's, like... like, d... like, disagreeing with you and like, "Screw you, like, no, that's not right." &gt;&gt; TYGA: She'll talk to you, like, when she's ready to talk to you about it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She doesn't get life, she's too far ahead of herself. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you guys talking about me? Can you guys go somewhere else and do that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Go somewhere else and do that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Do what? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Talk about me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm really happy that you're making an effort into, like, being the sexy goddess that you are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No effort necessary. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So why'd you bring T. here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Because I want him here. And I wasn't aware that you wanted to hang out with me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think that's the point of a family trip. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; TYGA: Kylie, for real, go talk to Kendall. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Um, maybe later. I guess I have been a little passive-aggressive towards Kendall because I'm just genuinely hurt and I feel a little neglected. My sisters just set up this amazing photo shoot for Kourtney. I feel like my sisters are always there for each other and it makes me miss that relationship with Kendall. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: And what's your first side, usually? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Great. Over here. Superb. Perfect. Very good. Gorgeous. Very nice. Left leg a little bit longer. Perfect. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Throw this on over this? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: He prefers you naked. The Antoine way is nudie, let's be honest. &gt;&gt; ANTOINE: You bring the dress higher. It's all about the legs. Beautiful. Just like that. One hand a little bit lower than the other one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's not anyone shoot my vagina. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott is just jumping around town with these chicks... ...and Kourtney is way flyer than those girls will ever be. &gt;&gt; ANTOINE: Beautiful. Gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hope Kourt knows that. I mean, I'm sure that doesn't make it better, but just knowing you're a badass bitch is just all that life is about. &gt;&gt; ANTOINE: Great. I guess that's... This was really nice. &gt;&gt; MAN: Those are cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like those. Yeah. &gt;&gt; ANTOINE: Yeah, those are very nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So cute. Thank you! &gt;&gt; ANTOINE: Superb! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you for everything. &gt;&gt; ANTOINE: Enjoy some bath. Have fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It was nice meeting you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was beautiful. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, booty face! Come over here! Whoo! Glam-azon! Kourt, you look so pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: How was your shoot? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was quick and easy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just how you like it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We did one in this, but they wanted no clothes underneath. And then we did this boy shorts and bra that I have under. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you just look fab and you should own it, embrace it, or... in St. Barths. And I think you look great, and I'm really happy that you're making an effort into, like, you know, being the sexy goddess that you are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. No effort necessary. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I don't even know how to give anybody a compliment over here, so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's up with the crown? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm a queen. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it wasn't a question-- I was telling you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I am the queen. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I have always been the queen. I was the original queen, and I took my crown back. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Mermaid, where are you? Mermaid! Where are you, Mermaid? &gt;&gt; NORTH: Where are you, Mermaid? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Why she's not coming? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, girls, look who's here. The mermaid. Oh, my God, it's a real mermaid. &gt;&gt; KIM: The mermaid's here! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: Lookit, guys, is that so pretty? She lives in the ocean. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You can get in the water with her if you want. Oh. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Go in the pool. Go under. &gt;&gt; KIM: Our kids are gonna be traumatized forever. &gt;&gt; TYGA: That's crazy. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: You sound like a dolphin. Did you see her tattoo? &gt;&gt; TYGA: Yeah. It's cool. It's just a little area, small enough. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I told her for 18 years she couldn't have a tattoo, and then the moment she turned 18, she ran out and got a tattoo. &gt;&gt; TYGA: That's what my mom told me-- she was like, "Don't." I was like, "I want to get a tattoo" when I was 15. But she didn't know about this one though. I-I hid this for, like, a year. But she-she didn't see it for, like, a whole year. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My son has a reason for every single tattoo he got. There's a purpose, a reason. &gt;&gt; TYGA: Just a time out of your life, like, that made me want to get this at that point in my life, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that Kylie's name? &gt;&gt; TYGA: Where? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean, "Where?" &gt;&gt; TYGA: What, here? Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That actually is really pretty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: As long as Kylie doesn't get "Tyga," we're good. &gt;&gt; TYGA: It's, like, a time out of your life though, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what Rob said. He was like, everything has a... like, a reason and a sentimental value. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Rob's probably stupidest tattoo is when he got "Adrienne" and then covered it with "Rita." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, with the picture of Rita. &gt;&gt; KIM: He covered it with a life-size Barbie doll of Rita that has now turned into a Cabbage Patch. Have you seen it lately? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What does it look like? &gt;&gt; KIM: It was, like, a Barbie doll, and as he gained weight, she was, like, a huge Cabbage Patch? Huge! What do you think? The tattoo stayed...? : She's, like, huge! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, babe. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You okay? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How are you, babe? Yeah, I'm great. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I was thinking about you all day. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, you weren't. There's no way. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes, I was. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You know, I was really looking forward to this trip to just hang out with you. I was a little sad to see T here. Not that I don't love him. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's kind of mean. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's not mean at all. I just said "not that I don't love him." It's actually really nice. You should like it that I want to spend time with you. So why'd you bring him? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Because I want him here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm just letting you know. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I wasn't aware that you wanted to hang out with me. Maybe if you called me and said, "I want..." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think that's the point of a family trip. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney can't be the only hot girl here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was just coming to say hi to your mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just a little bit caught off guard. It just makes me a little bit anxious. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I haven't spoke to anybody... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...in three months. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So why don't you talk to them-- but-but with me or without? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: With you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's actually really nice. You should like it that I want to spend time with you. So why'd you bring him? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Because I want him here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm just letting you know. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I wasn't aware that you wanted to hang out with me. Maybe if you called me and said, "I want..." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think that's the point of a family trip. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have a lot of people to please, I have a lot of people who love me, you know? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're just so wanted? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm really wanted. No, I'm just kidding. But yeah, then we should have sister time. I feel bad that Kendall's hurt, because I really didn't... mean for it to be that way. Kendall always has so much going on in her life and she's all over the place, and I'm always with T, so I didn't even think about it when I invited him. I'm sorry, Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You know, whenever you can fit me in your schedule... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I got... I got you. I'm gonna make an effort to hang out with her. A mosquito's biting you right now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, then get it off! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Go like that and see if it'll explode. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Love you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Let's go, Kylie. What's that? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's Hot Cheetos. &gt;&gt; TYGA: Hot Cheetos. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Before a hike? You're gonna throw up. &gt;&gt; TYGA: No, I'm not. I'm gonna sweat it out. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I definitely miss the connection that Kylie and I used to have, but I'm happy Kylie's actually including me in something. It smells disgusting! Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; TYGA: What's that smell? &gt;&gt; LOIC: Seaweed. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, I'm literally gonna throw up. I love being around my family. I think family is forever, and family will be there longer than your friends will be there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: T, you see them? &gt;&gt; TYGA: Yes. Yeah, I see them. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My sisters are, like, my best friends. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Damn, that sea urchin's big. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's really nice to kind of always have someone to lean on and be able to hang out with. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Sea urchins are so scary. &gt;&gt; LOIC: They, like, pass away. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right, let's walk over here. &gt;&gt; TYGA: I see you jigglin'. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Really? &gt;&gt; TYGA: Yeah. That booty jigglin'. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Greatest hike ever. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look how beautiful it is out here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. It's so pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll sit on this side so I can watch them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When Mason and I went on the jet ski, he pushed the thing, like, as fast as it could go. When we were going, he was like, so happy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Has he ever been one in Mexico? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, he goes with Scott on them, on the jet ski. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, that's North's. Mason, give that to North, please. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: People send me a photo and say, "Look at this." Scott has started posting things like this. Like, it's almost like he wanted me to look at his Instagram. &gt;&gt; KIM: But why would he want that, like, negativity? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just find it funny, 'cause they're all posting it on purpose, like, to be like, you know? I just want everyone to stop bothering me with, like, information, unless it's, like, an emergency. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, it's so hard seeing my children on a trip. that was the first trip that I've never been on with my own kids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You say, "Oh, I don't have a family," and then we give you one. Why do you, like, destroy it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just find it funny, 'cause they're all posting it on purpose, like, to be like, you know? I just want everyone to stop bothering me with, like, information, unless it's, like, an emergency. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Should I just write him and go, "What the hell is going on?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. We are on vacation having the time of our lives. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: I need some water. &gt;&gt; SERVER: Ladies, there's the kids' food for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, your food is here. Yum. What kind of ice cream is that? &gt;&gt; SERVER: Coconut. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really tart. Too crazy. Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; RODOLFO: Um, I've just been sitting here for 20 minutes, and, uh, I find you very beautiful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's your name? &gt;&gt; RODOLFO: I'm Rodolfo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rodolfo? Oh. &gt;&gt; RODOLFO: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is Kourtney Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; RODOLFO: Sorry to interrupt like this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you're gonna say that, you can interrupt any time. &gt;&gt; RODOLFO: Well, you know. I could help you out on surfing and diving or snorkeling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You wanted to take surf lessons with Mason. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to take surf lessons, but I want him to take surf lessons. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, well, maybe he could help out with that. &gt;&gt; RODOLFO: Yeah, definitely. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Coinkydink. &gt;&gt; RODOLFO: I wish you a good evening, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is this, like, a set-up thing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. You're beautiful. Why would you think that? No, I'm serious. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was cute that that guy came up, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, but, like, then what he... what does anyone say, or what do you do? &gt;&gt; KIM: Nothing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm hanging out with my family, and I just want to have some fun. I've been really busy with everything going on in my life. I'm just not into going on dates. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think at some point, you just have to follow your heart. &gt;&gt; LOIC: Super fast, go up and down, up and down. It's too slow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; MASON: Mom! &gt;&gt; LOIC: Yeah! Arms straight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you doing it? &gt;&gt; LOIC: Arms straight. You can follow the direction of your arm. You know, when you... &gt;&gt; MASON: What you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Water aerobics. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bike. &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to try. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He wants to come in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Give us one hour, kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mommy has to be healthy and strong. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, put your back into it, woman. &gt;&gt; LOIC: In front of me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am. My bike is, like, lopsided. &gt;&gt; LOIC: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is actually really hard. &gt;&gt; LOIC: Make a splash behind you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My whole ass has ridden up my butt. &gt;&gt; LOIC: Faster! Faster! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, you're my motivation for this. &gt;&gt; LOIC: Okay, stop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your butt is my motivation. &gt;&gt; LOIC: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, Kourtney can't be the only hot girl here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney has three kids. She's never looked better. She's, like, the hottest mom ever. But she's, like, so been out of the dating game for so long that she doesn't even realize it. &gt;&gt; LOIC: Kourtney, I want to see your chest getting out of the water. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, it's gonna take time, you know? But I'm really proud that Kourtney is taking these steps to get her life back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're a hot, sexy MILF. I don't know what's going on with Scott, but he's not the only guy around. Kourt, when you look that hot, you're gonna rise to the top, girl. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys ready to go home? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're going home! Yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm glad you came with us, Tyga. &gt;&gt; TYGA: I had a good time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you? I'm glad you were here. &gt;&gt; TYGA: It's my first time in St. Barts, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? You had a lot of firsts on this trip. We've had a really drama-filled year. Good trip. So it's been really great to have a little break. I'm just hoping that this is the start of a new beginning. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You ready to rock and roll? I had so much fun on this trip. I had all the kids, got to hang out with my sisters and my mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you so much! It was wonderful! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just think I needed to get out of town. &gt;&gt; MAN: Au revoir. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ugh! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where'd he go? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Right there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's right there. It's right there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: On mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's on her head. It's on mom's head. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie, no, don't do it like that. You got to like... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm scared. I'm scared. It's right there. It's right there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is it? Take your purse. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Right there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's in your hand! &gt;&gt; TYGA: You got it. You got it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love these family trips. I think being away so much kind of makes you appreciate hanging out with your family a lot more. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Sent a mass text. I was like, "Can you believe Stanley's closed?" &gt;&gt; GREG: I remember you were in with your dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, ladies. &gt;&gt; GREG: You were sitting in a corner, and I said, "God, I didn't know he had a daughter." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim's gonna eat, because she's pregnant, while we're doing the meeting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is Kourtney and Khloe. This is Greg. &gt;&gt; GREG: Haven't seen you guys forever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, stop. Are you joking? Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; GREG: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim and I were talking when were realized we were gonna go to lunch one day, all of us, and we heard Stanley's was closed, and first, we were mad. We were like, "We couldn't get a warning to have one last Amy's salad and the Chinese chicken salad and all of our favorites." And then we all started thinking about all the things we were gonna be missing in our life. And Kim and I said, "Well, wait a minute. Calabasas has no great restaurants." And so, we're obviously very interested. What does it mean to get into the restaurant business together? &gt;&gt; GREG: It has to be a fun, like, clubhouse for you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Should we call this Dash Diner? Dine and Dash? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dine and Dash. &gt;&gt; GREG: It's sort of cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We could do Kris's pasta primavera and Kris's rice pilaf. Maybe Kris's swordfish. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: None of those things sound like I want them in my restaurant. You need to, like, maybe pump the brakes a tad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I get excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Scott! Hi! I'm... shocked. I haven't seen Scott since months ago. So, I'm surprised to see him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just been a really hard time, going from, like, having all of you guys to having nobody, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It breaks my heart to see her in pain, and all that we ever wanted for you guys was to be happy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you so much. All right, I'll walk you out. &gt;&gt; GREG: Scott, good seeing you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, you, too. Take care. I was just coming to say hi to your mom. I didn't know... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...every person in the world was here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I knew that my mom and Scott have been trying to have a conversation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I had no idea that today is when they were going to be talking. I'm just a little bit caught off-guard. It just makes me a little bit anxious. Where are you guys talking? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I feel like I haven't spoke to anybody... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...in three months, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: So why don't you go get your sisters? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So why don't you talk to them? But with me or without? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: With you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, let's go in here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo, will you come down? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, coming. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott wanted to talk to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! Finally! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe just said to me that she hasn't talked to you in a long time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I haven't talked to anybody in a long time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, he's talking to everyone? It's, like, serious? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I don't know. I just feel like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you gonna wear your glasses for this meeting? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just because, you know... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you gonna cry? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know, uh, I don't think you need to make fun of me, I mean... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I was totally kidding. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm in a pretty awesome place in my life, and it's been really easy. You know, it's so hard seeing my children on a trip. That was the first trip that I've never been on with my own kids. I was so jealous and scared that I chartered a plane and brought a bunch of people to Mexico that I didn't even know. Just to, like, make myself feel better, and all it's done is make myself feel worse. You know, you guys were the only people I ever had, so being an only child and then not even having parents, it's, like, it's very scary. Dealing with this by myself has not been, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but you act like we made that choice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Listen... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, you made that choice, so don't put that on our shoulders. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not putting it on anybody's shoulders. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just did by saying that though. Like, that... like, you're not gonna shift blame. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not shifting blame, I realize I'm in the wrong, and I've been in the wrong a long time. Trust me, if you didn't have one person alive in your family when you went through your divorce with Lamar, you wouldn't be doing all that well. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure. It was the hardest thing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like, you guys are super, super lucky that you have each other. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I'm not here to, like, make excuses and justify and try to get anybody to be on my side. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, but also that "woe is me" thing, it's like, we were "woe is you," we were trying to help you and be there for you and sympathize with you. And we still love you and want to do that. But for you to say, "This has been tough for me to go through," we never wanted you to go through this. We always wanted to be there with you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I agree with you... &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I'm really glad that Khloe's here 'cause she always speaks her mind. I think she's saying all the things that Kourtney wishes she could say, and that makes me just really happy that Khloe can really stand up for Kourtney. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just sad, because, you know, I considered everybody in this house, like... my sister, my mom... You know what I mean? And it's just like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not like, "Oh, Scott's gone, it's so easy." Like, no. It's... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, I mean, I'm happy to hear that, obviously, in my mind. 'Cause of my insecurities, I feel like everyone's just, like, leaning on each other, like, no big deal, let's move on, Scott's out of here, let's move to the next one. You know, it was weird for me to lose not just her, but, like, everybody else I knew, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the stuff that I don't understand. You say, "Oh, I don't have a family and I don't have all these things." And then we give you one. Why do you, like, destroy it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the stuff that I don't understand. You say, "Oh, I don't have a family and I don't have all these things." And then we give you one. Why do you, like, destroy it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sure you guys have heard a lot of horrible things about me that I should've just been honest with, but I was too ashamed that I was gonna hurt everybody in this family and not just her, and I've apologized to Kourtney 100 times, but I've never apologized to, like, all of you, for letting all of you down and embarrassing you guys and... I understand I need to help myself way before I can help her or my kids or whatever. But it's just been a really hard time... going from, like, having all of you guys to having nobody, you know? It's like... But I'm, like, living in a house by myself. You know, I want to pick up the phone and call my mom and dad and be like, "Tell me how the hell, on your side, to, like, figure this out. What... should I go somewhere? Should I do something?" It's just not as easy as you think when you have addiction issues and, like, I'm just so ashamed that, like, I publicly embarrassed all of you. You guys really did so much for me for so many years and it's just... It kills me to the point that I feel like I can't make it up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: People are human and they make mistakes. We've all been through enough that I don't think anybody sitting here today is worried about the perception of being embarrassed. And I never want you to feel abandoned. I mean, I can't imagine what that feels like, but I never want you to feel that way. But when you are on this downward spiral, we want to make... It's like, I was very conflicted, because I want to make sure you're okay, too. You're the father of my grandchildren. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We love you. I... the love... you just don't turn love off like a switch. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't want everybody to just think that I had no care in the world and I just floated around town and did whatever I wanted to do. You know how many times I've wanted to come over and sit with you and just explain and go through all the reasons of how I got here? I've never been this unhappy in my life, you know? It's like... It's just terrible to, like... I don't, like... If I didn't have those kids, I would kill myself. But I have them and I'm gonna be here and I'm gonna make it right for them, you know? You know, I just... I just hope that somehow, like, you know, I'm... not that I'm religious, but God can, like, give me a chance or us a chance at this or something. Because, like, I just know I'll never have the happiness that I would have otherwise and, you know, it's been nice having you guys in my life for so long, so... It's weird to lose that many people that quick, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We all love you very much. And you can say that, you know... It breaks my heart to see her in pain. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It-It's one of the hardest things you can go through, as a mom, to see you kid, you know, struggling. And all that we ever wanted for you guys was to be happy. But you have to make the decision that what you want is to be a partner and a dad and involved and present and committed and you fight for what you want and you need and you love and you show somebody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you and Kourt are together or not, like, I still care about you and I want the best for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: We all do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And what you did was up, but I appreciate you saying something, 'cause I was really disappointed in you. I think what Kourtney wants to see most out of you is action. She might not be as vulnerable and to say it as I am, but Kourtney wants to see that you have faith in your own self. So she could believe in you that much stronger. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I don't think it's also healthy for Kourtney-- and I think she knows this-- to spend so much energy always helping you, when all you do is, like,on her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Agreed. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I think that's why she... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I want someone who also helps me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to help you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not just that I'm helping. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I agree. You need somebody that you could stand on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think Scott always means it when he says that he wants to make a change. I just think he really doesn't know how to get there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to be able to be the man that you've always wanted. I could party, I could go out every night, I could do whatever. That's not the life I really want. I-I know what I want and I may not get it, but I know that I would literally hate myself for the rest of my life if I didn't at least try. And I realize that if I don't make a change now, like, it'll never be able to be okay. And it may not be, but I'm damn well gonna try and I just wanted you guys to know that and I wanted to see you guys and... I just love you all and miss you guys so much, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We love you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We love you, too. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sure everybody has things to do, so I'll let you guys do what you got, but thank you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: On the next episode... It's so exciting that it's New York Fashion Week. Kylie's gonna be at Kanye's show. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, that's up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'll find you later. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've heard from a couple people that... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? You're scaring me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's really good that you're going to the app announcement for the girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why is it for the girls and not for me? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's gonna look bad, like, "It just wasn't ready." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just had a baby when we were working on it. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. You're not special.
