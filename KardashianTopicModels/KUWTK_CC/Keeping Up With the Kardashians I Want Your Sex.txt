- &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You don't want to play? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hold on, I got... You can play on your own. But this could be like, you know, how they do it in school? You get like a little spanking. So if you don't do your report, if you don't get the answers right. I'm scared to use it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not hard. You're scared. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't be a little bitch. Tonight's the night of Lamar's first game. Ow! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hurts a little bit? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: She likes it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Man up! But at least we have a few hours to cuddle before his game tonight. Ow! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That one hurt... ..stings. ♫ ♫ Tonight Lamar is gonna receive his championship ring, and I'm so excited that my entire family gets to see him receive it. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Lamar Odom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Go, Lamar! Whoo! Lamar! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tonight it's a home game, so I get to go this game. But unfortunately, not all of them are going to be home games. There's 82 games a year. 41 here, 41 away. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe and Lamar are gonna start spending a lot of time apart. His schedule's gonna get a little crazy and he's gonna be on the road more. And this is gonna be the first time that they've really been apart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's gonna be so weird. Since the day we met, we've literally been inseparable. Now I'm gonna have to go without him for, like, weeks on ends sometimes. That's my man, bitch. Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm just playing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Please, let go. Please, stop! You're hurt... &gt;&gt; KIM: So, like, how do you feel that-- like, Lamar, you're gonna be on the road working. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, work is work. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not gonna miss me so much? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know what she feels. This is the life that I've lived being in a relationship with Reggie for so many years. You have to do whatever it takes to keep the spice and to just make sure that you guys spend as much time together as possible. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Now, you know I'm a beau. They call me a beau. &gt;&gt; KIM: A beau? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: In these magazines. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you Khloe's beau? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: B-e-a-u? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He said he's never been called a beau before and it-- he loves the word beau. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm gonna start to wear bow ties all the time. I'm a sex symbol now. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Heya, bug. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I had a long day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You did? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I am ready for you tonight. You know that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh... come on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so tired. I feel really bad. I've been denying Scott sex lately. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was the only kind of kiss I get? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. Leave me alone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Leave. No, go out. Wait. Don't. Don't. Stop. I'm just, like, not in the mood. I just feel like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, get in the mood. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's no more room to fit anything else in there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not asking to park a dump truck in there. I'm just asking to let me get in there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: At least I'm being honest with you and telling you it's not you. It's not like I'm not attracted to you or don't want to have sex with you. It's just that I'm scared... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, you know what you have to do. You said you're attracted to me. That just put me in a clear line for a &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't I what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...stay on your side of the bed. The truth is, I'm just scared that the sex is gonna hurt the baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I hate not being able to touch you. I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't say don't touch me. I just said... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You just said to stay on my side of the bed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You keep talking like that, you're gonna have to sleep on the couch. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you keep acting like this, I'm gonna want to. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's such a gloomy day. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It is. Summer's over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, do you really know that Lamar's longest road trip is 16 days? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You just still have to find a way to, like, still nurture your relationship at the same time. So when you're away from each other, you can still feel like you're connected. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I could do like a scrapbook of, like, favorite memories. But what man is gonna, like, carry around a scrapbook? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, what else can I do? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Maybe like a, um, a video. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like a solo sex tape? Like masturbation? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I am not going to videotape you masturbating. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you would be like this. You know, I kind of like the idea of a sexy little video. I could be naughty. Oh... my... God. I should-- 'cause he's obsessed with candy-- bags and bags and bags of Skittles and put them in a bathtub and be like sitting in it with, like, a tiara. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That would be cute. You're gonna have Skittles in places you've never had them before. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, honey. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MALIKA: What about the schoolgirl outfit? Please be the plastic nurse. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is a sexy little video. So, the first step is finding the perfect wardrobe. We go to a fire station and get the big baggy thing. Can I ask someone? Might as well go all out, right? With all this stuff, I can't go wrong. I'm gonna have Lamar drooling after he sees this. &gt;&gt; The collar's attached to nipple clamps. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh no! &gt;&gt; Hey, don't knock it till you try it. Total comes to $586.15. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's not bad at all, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not that bad? Are you crazy? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, bugs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you up to? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Packing my, um, hospital bag... my ugly nursing bras. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And you're wearing sexy ones now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't even want to get naked in front of me anymore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes I do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No less have sex ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I always run around. Well, I don't want to have sex when I'm thinking about nipple cream that I had to buy today. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I don't want to think about nipple cream for pregnancy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, does this make you feel sexy when I have to buy full butt underwear that you have to wear? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Put a nursing bra and some boy panties and some nipple cream, and that's my fantasy of you pregnant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just think you're being annoying, and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm being annoying? I'm trying to make love to you throughout your pregnancy. It helps the baby come quicker. So, are we gonna do it or what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is being super annoying right now. And he's not taking my feelings into account. You're just being really selfish and insensitive. And, like, don't make fun of me over it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not making fun of you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, you are! You'remaking fun of me over it. You're such a douche! &gt;&gt; Welcome. This is survival skills for sex during pregnancy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is what I want at the end of the night? Come squat on my face? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe play with this a little. I'm editing this love tape for Lamar and, oh, my God, is this awful. He's never gonna come home if he sees this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You mind if I come in? Hi. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Keep going. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't mean to be rude to you, I was only kidding. I feel like this should be the time that we're the closest, and I feel like I'm the farthest. It's not just about sex, it's just about the fact, having sex with you sometimes makes me feel closer to you. I don't know what else to do anymore. I just, I miss a lot of things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott has a point, and I miss us being intimate, too; like, we need to figure this out. Okay. Well, I miss you, too. You're right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I love you, little one. I love you, little, little one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, so Kourt, what are you so afraid of? Like, I don't understand why you won't just bone him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not afraid. The baby's getting big, and I'm small, so I was like, how can I fit another thing inside of me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know that Kourtney's afraid to have sex while she's pregnant, but she needs to know that in all honesty, there is nothing that will hurt that baby. I've had six kids, and I was very sexually active with all six kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have never wanted sex more than when I was pregnant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew, Mom! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew, Mom! &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, we just don't want to hear that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But you're also bigger than me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so maybe you should go to, like, a class where they teach you. You can look online and find a class where they'll teach you, like, different... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who would, wait, you want her to go to a sex class for while she's pregnant? That's sick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe she needs to go to a sex class. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is it for pregnant people or it's... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, it's for pregnant people. If you wanted me to explain to you, like, sexually, what I was going through... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I would rather hear it from a stranger. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm done, this is sick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was actually hornier after the babies... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, seriously, you're grossing me out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was horny! &gt;&gt; MAN: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: What can I help you wit &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today is the day I'm making my little love tape, and I'm trying a bunch of different locations. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, then wrap your other leg around, there you go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was so much scarier than I thought. I have to do it again. &gt;&gt; MAN: Good job. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo! Hi. I never thought I was gonna be self-conscious in front of a camera. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You ready? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Baby, you gotta come home and put this fire out. Every time I try to be sexy, I just, like, make a joke 'cause I think I'm so stupid. You gotta come home, baby, so I could put your fire out. Like, I can't be sexy on demand. I'm, like, just so embarrassed. Yay! Raining-- ow! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Sorry! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's okay, little baby. Ow! That hurts my boobs! Oh, come on! Come on! See how hard that sounds? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Well, watch it, don't... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe, stop being a baby. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Get ready to make a sweet message. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, what exactly am I saying? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Just say anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know what to say. I'm totally comfortable being sexy in front of Lamar but not in front of Malika. This is so unnatural. You had such a good game tonight that I want you to come home with me and take a bath. I feel so lame. Mmm... Yum. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: So cute! So cute! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't like doing this anymore. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's adorable! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, um, what did CeCe say? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She said we can go to dinner tomorrow night anywhere from, like, 8:00 to 8:30. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. I'm looking at these pregnancy sex classes that my mom told me about, 'cause she told me... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you spoke to her finally? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, thanks, bug. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was traumatizing. She said that you can have sex when you're pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, we're good to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She said these classes, like, just tell you everything-- what you can and can't do. Pregnancy sex class might be kind of fun, and maybe it'll teach me a couple things to make me not as anxious about having sex while pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm happy that you finally went out of your way. I know it must've been weird talking to your mom, but I just want it to be back to normal. If it means going to some weird sex class, I'll do it. I love you, and I just want to be close again to you. All right, well, I'm excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, you'll go to the class? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If it means I get to get in your panties again, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It does. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What happens when your water breaks? You just pee on yourself? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's like an explosion in your pantyhose. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Malika and I came up with this idea for Lamar to, um, like, take our flip camera and just do like a video montagey thing. Just like, fun and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have costumes that I haven't done yet. A nurse's outfit, a schoolgirl outfit, just like random stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No way. Go get them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't be any less sexy than I was with Malika, so I'll give it a shot. I'll put on an outfit, and I'll try to do another little skit for Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah! Okay. Let me get into position. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Smack your ass, turn around. Give it a little spank. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, was that good? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Let's do round two. Poor Khloe, she is so not sexy right now. Oh, come on! Don't you have a bra? And you have a crotchless bodysuit on? Now do you feel super comfortable? I think the only way to save Khloe in this video is to make it not sexy and to just make it cute and funny. I just need a simple... ...and then at the end, turn around, shake your bunny tail and that's it. Turn around. Good girl! I taught you well. Hi. &gt;&gt; HELENA: Welcome, welcome, welcome. This is survival skills for sex during pregnancy. So, let's talk about whether sex is safe. It is safe. The main and most important thing is that you be comfortable. How many of you are into rabbit sex? That really hard, fast, pounding kind of sex? It's time to slow down and feel a bit. Okay, you've all been using these blocks, right? They're kind of nice. This can be your best friend. So now, we're gonna actually get into position. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This pregnancy sex class is very interesting. &gt;&gt; HELENA: Very good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; HELENA: Leg has to be under the waist. So your leg will go right there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Under there. &gt;&gt; HELENA: Right there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; HELENA: Okay? See what these guys are doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is this just a cuddle? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, does the penis get used in this exercise? &gt;&gt; HELENA: And this is really good for your legs, the squatting, too. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you going to reach this thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's just for you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is what I want at the end of the night-- come squat on my face? This is a sick, deluded world we're living in. &gt;&gt; HELENA: You can use your fantastic legs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, fella. &gt;&gt; HELENA: Sex is that space where you go to be intimate, to be warm, to be loving, connecting in many, many different kinds of ways. You've got the ability to connect and touch and look. That's my very favorite, even to this day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so relieved to hear that sex during pregnancy is completely safe as long as you go a little more slow and gentle. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, let's all go home andthese pregnant girls. &gt;&gt; MAN: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need help picking some more songs for this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because I seriously can-- I've just been having second thoughts. I, like, cannot get it together. ♫ ♫ That is so not a sexy song. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, keep it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How am I going to tell in one second? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so awful. I'm editing this love tape for Lamar, and oh, my God, is this awful. Like, I cannot edit it enough to make it look sexy. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you guys doing? What can't I see? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe has a video that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, please, please...! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...she's-- we've been working on for Lamar. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, you've got to push play. Push play. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, how did you film this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe play with this a little. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need to just do it like-- what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This was a roadie trip present, and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like when he's on the road, just like to be cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, that's so cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's never going to come home if he sees this. Oh, I can't give this to him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I changed my mind. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, it's made. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KIM: How many guys would love, like, their wife to just give them something like...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think Khloe is being a little hard on herself. I mean, come on, she's not a professional porn star, which is not even what Lamar wants her to be. You could slip it in his bag. He goes out of town tonight, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Either you're slipping it in his bag or we are. Tonight is the magic night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are such evil s. &gt;&gt; ROB: Want to play Madden? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You're not really, not really that good. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tonight is the night before Lamar's first road trip, and I'm really sad about it, so we're going to hang out a little before he leaves. &gt;&gt; DELIVERY MAN: You guys ordered pizza? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DELIVERY MAN: All right, uh, $17.22. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't have cash. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I only have hundreds. &gt;&gt; ROB: Let me get some from Khlo. Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; ROB: I need some money for the food. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My purse is right by the door. Just get it out of the wallet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. &gt;&gt; ROB: Porno. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's a weird situation. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott lifts a DVD with "XXX" on one side and on the other side, a picture of my sister Khloe half-nude-- weird. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob, put on some video games or something. &gt;&gt; ROB: For the record, it is not my idea to play this DVD at all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What theis this? &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott, what the are you putting on? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is what you guys do with each other? Ew, I cannot look at this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What theare you guys watching?! Turn this off, turn it off! How do you work this?! This is so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ew! What the?! My eyes! My eyes! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why the hell are Rob and Scott watching this tape? It's just sick. I don't know how to work this! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo. &gt;&gt; ROB: She's not the sister I thought she was. What just happened? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, that was funny. It was a joke, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know I shouldn't be this upset, but I am a little sad. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Are you crazy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got a real freak in the sheets over there. &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe, come here. Khloe. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, that was too much. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think Khloe's embarrassed. That's hard for her to do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, you'd better get in there, L.O. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Boy. Khloe... ♫ Bad boy. ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is all this? It's not just the sex that I miss, it's the intimacy. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I mean, that was classic material. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's special. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think Khloe's, like, more embarrassed that we... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean, bro? She's mortified. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think she's upset. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, really? You should probably find your wife and tell her, "I still love you and I think you're sexy as hell." &gt;&gt; ROB: That's hard for her to do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, you'd better get in there, L.O. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, boy. Khloe... Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Huh-huh? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hmm? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one else was supposed to see that. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Can I keep it, though? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: For those long road trips? I'm going to need it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What, so you can show everyone and laugh? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No. Why would I show everyone that? You're the sexiest person in the world to me, dead serious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Even in th-that? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Even with, I mean, even, even-- that's a little different. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All a girl wants is for her man to make her feel beautiful and stunning, and, I mean, he makes me feel that way and he tells me every single day and that's all I ever wanted to hear. I'm glad you liked it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I didn't like it, I loved it. I loved it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I tried. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No, you didn't try. You succeeded. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is all this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Surprise. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got our new little friend. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, no way. You got it? I'm so glad things are back to normal. I mean, it's not just the sex that I miss, it's the intimacy, and Scott and I have always been super affectionate, and I'm glad that things are back that way. ♫ Bad boy. ♫ Oh, yeah. Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hiya, Scott. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you guys? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Something's been going on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't strangle her. Get your hand off of her boob. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who did that? &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott, be a little more respectful around my mother. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Ew... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you mind? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ugh, vomit. Ew, Scott! She's little! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See, Khloe, two can play this game. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get a room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew, Bruce, ew! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Suck it, suck his &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am not in the mood. I am not in the mood. I am not in the mood, and you made me spill stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Premature ejaculation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's the most I've gotten in a long time. &gt;&gt; Next on Keeping up with the Kardashians. &gt;&gt; Vegas, baby. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim's hosting a big birthday bash. We're here to get drunk, have a good time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, no, no, no, no! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it, Scott. Scott! Stop.
