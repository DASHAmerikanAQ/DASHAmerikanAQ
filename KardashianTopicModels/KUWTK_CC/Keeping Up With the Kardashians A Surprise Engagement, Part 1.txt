- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How do you think we are as far as, like, staff members here? &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: I think we need an assistant manager. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, a new person? &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: A new person. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I am sweating like there's no tomorrow. This is, like, insane. Ah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe. &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And that's my hair. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are we going to get that out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ah... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's funny. There we go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, good. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, your boob is so much bigger than the other one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What am I supposed to do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop breastfeeding. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not gonna stop just because of, like, vanity. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When are you going to stop? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No plan. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you're gonna breastfeed until, like, your kid's, like, five? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. Hold on. I want to show you something. I need my iPhone for this one. Here. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Samantha Roberts breastfed her eldest daughter Charlotte until she was five and is still breastfeeding Elizabeth at nearly eight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's... I can't watch this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you... mental? The kid is in fifth grade. &gt;&gt; GIRL: It's better than anything in the world. Better than a mango. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Better than a mango? Is that what she said? &gt;&gt; REPORTER: And Elizabeth is still breastfeeding at seven. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so cute to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so weird. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think it's sweet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If the kid could say, "Yo, Mom, pull out your, let me suck on it," that's ridiculous. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Where's your room here? I always forget in this house. &gt;&gt; KIM: Over here. Okay, I got all the magazine covers from the week I gave birth. I was so huge. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You were a walking water balloon. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You were like this, like, walking out of the car. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was seriously, like, one huge egg. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Like an egg timer. But you look good. You're nothing like you were when you were pregnant. Like, I mean, you shed, what, like, 40 pounds already? &gt;&gt; KIM: So far 40. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, but now you have that cute little bundle of joy. The cutest baby, literally, ever. &gt;&gt; KIM: She is so cute. I thought it would be so hard to step out of the spotlight for a little bit and just be a mom, but I'm just really enjoying being at home with my baby. I'm not worried about, you know, really anything else. My priorities have definitely shifted, and I'm kind of enjoying my new lifestyle. Her passport is so cute. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Is she just like... with those eyes? &gt;&gt; KIM: Didn't I send you the photo? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No. I don't know. Not the passport one. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, I never showed you? Really? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You sent me, like, 64 00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:58,322 five and the videos. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have to see. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God, those cheeks. She's amazing. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, wait, those drawers, I can't utilize anymore? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just not to get confused, all of this is mine. These are all empty boxes for when I do have to pack that up eventually. My sunglasses, sunglasses, all my things. Oh, and this one has a lock on it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, who's got the key? &gt;&gt; KIM: I do. Why would you have the key to my diamonds? &gt;&gt; KRIS: First, let's start out by saying this is my closet and that was my drawer. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then these, I didn't really line them. I just took these from my old house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love that Kim and Kanye are living at the house with the baby, but I don't think it's my house anymore. They've kind of... made it into the Kim, Kanye and North house. Yay. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's kind of weird when you sit and talk to yourself, like, if I'm not there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't even have words. 87 00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:06,803 &gt;&gt; KIM: You love it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not for you. You have to eat your lunch. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what I realized? You are a wallpaper addict. We should make Addicts Anonymous for wallpaper... for patterns. In that bathroom, there's the pattern with the leaf things, with the m... and just so much going on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But it's so good. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's your taste. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're gonna feel so Zenned out when you come to my new house. It's gonna be hard to sell this house. Like, you know how, like, you look at homes and you're like, "What were they thinking?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mmm... &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just thinking of Kim and her life of judgmental-ness. &gt;&gt; KIM: Me and my judgmental-ness? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. You know, just something's not your... your way, you can't... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I said I love it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...you can't like it for what it is... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I like it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and embrace it. In our family, we are all brutally honest with each other and tell each other if we don't like something. But lately Kim has just been a little bit annoying. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, we need to have an intervention with Bruce and his ponytail. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Crochet is in. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is, but, like, your-your look just isn't. What is this outfit? I'm, like, mortified. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Would you go in public with her, with her wearing that? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe she's going a little stir-crazy or she's hormonal. I don't know what's going on, but she's just picking on every little thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you redo your brows? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, little bit. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, thank God. 122 00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:44,706 They were like wildebeests. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Lamar. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you? Are you at the loft? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: No. No, I went down... I went down to the beach. Redondo Beach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're in Redondo Beach? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Where are you going? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Um... I'm going to the East Coast. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You and I are technically, like, still married, and I think we need to just talk about, like, your leaving town. I think we need to just talk about that whole aspect. Do you mind if I call you in one or two hours? I'm looking at Dash office spaces with Kourt. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'll be right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. He is not allowed to leave town. I have to ask Bob, and that's why I have to, like, stall him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. Well, let's talk about something positive. I told you about our trip to Par-ee in Janua-ry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And Scott's like, "You want to plan a trip with Khloe, but you won't plan one with me?" And I was like, "You're coming." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Khloe's the hot commodity. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was like, "We're all going." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "It's with Khloe and you. I'm the third wheel." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love it. Being the third wheel is, like, 151 00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:17,939 the new black. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you like this one? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why do my legs shake more? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kind of off a little bit. Tomer. &gt;&gt; TOMER: Hey, how are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tomer, you're so dapper right now. &gt;&gt; TOMER: Are you guys ready to look at some, uh, office space? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh,, where are you going? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you like our outfits? &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it a club? Oh, my God, I have those shoes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do, too! I have them in brown. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So does Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I took them... I took all those things off of them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like the things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, you're so fancy, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: These jeans are my old jeans, and this top is my old top, and it's all starting to fit again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so fancy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's exciting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Hey. &gt;&gt; TOMER: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; TOMER: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where do you want to do this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, we can sit in-in my nice room over there. We can sit at the table. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's your nice room now, not Mom's? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Anybody need me, I'll be in the gym. Hey, Gabbana. Hey, Ken. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Who do you think you are? You're dressed kind of like... Khloe or something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Didn't you get the memo? This is what's going on in my color palette world for the day. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why are you out here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm out here because I'm trying to find something to do where I can get a little fresh air and take a deep breath because I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. Kim has been in my bathroom all morning doing her makeup, and now she's having a meeting at the dining room table. I can't even find a place to have any privacy or talk on a phone. There's one, two, three, four, fix, six, seven, eight, nine, maybe ten cars in the driveway at all times. I can't even get my cars out. And I'm having a little anxiety attack. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, I'm sorry. I don't know what you... I can't feel bad for you. You agreed to all this. It was my mom's idea in the first place to have Kim and Kanye stay in the house, and she was so overjoyed. And now she's the one that wants them out. It's just ironic. I just think it's funny that you talked us into it, and now you're the one that hates it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I don't hate it. It's just... who knew that somebody could have... that many strollers? I mean... I-I... I just... It's a lot. I love you guys so much, but it's a lot. There's things happening that... It's like... I can't keep control of the situation in my own house. I don't even know what's in my pantry anymore or... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, Kim is so annoying with that. She takes out all the good food. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it's like... I'm just so confused in my own house. Nothing feels familiar. And as much as I love everybody so much, sometimes you just need a break. &gt;&gt; TOMER: So, we're gonna look at three properties today. The first one's actually getting reconfigured right now, so the good thing is you guys would have an option of kind of reconfiguring it the way you want. The second one we're gonna see is this one. You'd be on the second floor. It's got three offices. And then the third one we're gonna see is actually right on Ventura. It's close by here, and the whole building is basically vacant now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'm not gonna go 'cause I have to breastfeed, but the girls will go, and I trust their opinion. &gt;&gt; TOMER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. Keep me posted. Have fun at the club called office spaces. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will. &gt;&gt; KIM: She literally looks like she's going to a club. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you literally look like you're soannoying. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whatever, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just 'cause you're in a good color palette doesn't mean you can judge others for going to the club. Kim has been very critical, very judgmental. She has an opinion about everything. You're just jealous that you can't be in a tight whore dress like you used to be in Miami. &gt;&gt; KIM: Soon, my friend. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've had one too many comments from Kim, and it's driving me insane. How is it livin' with K-I-M? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm, like, so annoyed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so let's call her Fancy Nancy. Now we can talk about her right in front of her face. How annoying is Nance? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Annoying, judgmental hooker. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who is this Nancy person? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Anthony. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: Kanye wants to do, like, a massive surprise party for Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know there's a lot more to this story, and I'm gonna get to the bottom of it. Whatever you guys have up your 249 00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:49,800 sleeve, I bet it's gonna be amazing. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What could be like Flashback Friday but, like, Monday? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's Monday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So what can I say? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Memory Monday? Memorial Monday? I... No, that's... I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Member This Monday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guess who Lamar's back with. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Jaime. Jamie. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So that's why we haven't heard from him at all? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, what's your plan? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, you're gonna have to make that decision on your own, but do you want to stay married to someone that you don't even know where they are? I mean, for two years, you've been living like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I don't. Like, I wish I didn't have to end it. Obviously, this is not the life I want to live, but, like, it's really awkward to do something so serious and say, like, "I'm having a divorce," and he doesn't get it. I will always love Lamar. I wish we could live that perfect life that we once had, but it's not that easy. He just wants to run from his problems, and I get frustrated 'cause I feel like I've tried to put the pieces back together all on my own. And I can't just keep staying in, like, this limbo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Talk to a therapist. It might just be good. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're over the therapist, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop pushing this therapist on me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to go tomorrow at 4:30? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll rewind. I don't want to meet with the therapist. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Or Wednesday at 5:00? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at me for a sec. Go like this. You should just do a little bonding in between your teeth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-uh. I knew you were gonna say that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I used to have that, a little hole in between. Just looks like a piece of pepper. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim is typically a very busy person, and for Kim to go from being pulled in so many different directions to basically stuck in a house, I think it's left Kim with nothing else to do but time to judge all of us. Did you hear what we did this weekend while we were in Vegas? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who told you? &gt;&gt; KIM: TMZ articles. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have way too much time on your hands. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Way too much time 297 00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:06,530 on your hands. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Scott, how are you? &gt;&gt; MASON: Cheers! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, cheers, my sweet, innocent love child. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love child. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are we cheers-ing to? Cheers to Mason being 40 inches tall today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my goodness. Cheers. That's a good cheers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cheers to Mason. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can I get, like, a side of mashed potatoes? &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Mashed potatoes? Sure. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How is it... how is it livin' with K-I-M? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm, like, so annoyed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She is on my last nerve. Like, all she does is critique what I'm wearing or what I look like. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, didn't she tell you the other day that you were making her look bad 'cause you were wearing something? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's hard to be up to her standards. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But she's not any better, like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, burn, Kendall, burn. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel a burn comin' on. She's kind of judgmental, I guess. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, incredibly. All she does is judge. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She should be like Judge Judy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We should call her Judy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Judge Judy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yo, Judy's kind of funny. &gt;&gt; MASON: Fahrvergnugen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's... So let's call her either a Fahrvergnugen... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fahrvergnugen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but then if we're around her, she's gonna know, like, Fahrvergnugen is, like... There has to be, like, a name that, like, could be realistic but, like, somewhat... you know, that's just, like, a normal name. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so let's call her Fancy Nancy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so down. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have nicknamed Kim "Nancy" because Kim has been so nasty. Now we can talk about her right in front of her face and she has no idea who we're talking about. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think that's it. Nancy's number one, Judy's the backup. 338 00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:53,472 ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: God, my neck hurts today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yep? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a good question. Today Kim decided that my office is now her office, so I have no choice and this is my new office, my bathroom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what I'm looking for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Huh? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My old phone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bruce Meyer and I are, uh, gonna put on a... Bruce party again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A Bruce party again? How many Bruces do you know? There's, like, two Bruces. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, last, uh... last one we did, like, three or four years ago, we had 18 Bruces there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 18 people named their kid Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And we only played Bruce Springsteen music. Our photographer who was taking pictures, his name was Bruce. The list went on and on and on. Everybody's name there was Bruce or you weren't allowed. So, anyway, we're gonna do it again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's been three years, and a lot of the old phone numbers, I didn't transfer over. Have you seen the old phone? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go look in the top drawer, uh, in the end table next to the bed. It's probably there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is this it? God, it's right on top. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, then there you go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See? I come in handy every once in a while. Bruce. 369 00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:25,071 Bruce party. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, I need to start having North wear a bib. Do you think this bib she would like? It says Northwest Airlines. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is so cute, I will agree. &gt;&gt; KIM: You want to see something super cute? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought you don't shop. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a gift to North. You'll die. So cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought you hate hot pink. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a gift from Stella McCartney. This one is so her, don't you think? She'll love it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Remember the onesie I gave you, that you gave it back? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I gave it back. It didn't fit her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, why don't you snap a few pics? Do you think Nancy would... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do I have my phone here? Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You should snap pictures. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nancy would not be down with... &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, no shoes on my carpet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's like, she lays here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God, did you get a gift from Nancy before, Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I got only neutral, no color, from Nancy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How annoying is Nance? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's... She's like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Who is this Nancy person, and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's one of Kourtney's friends. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I would really know who this Nancy person is, 'cause I know everyone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't know every single friend of ours. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you don't. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, who is Nancy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just some annoying, judgmental hooker. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not a hooker. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kind of. She called me the other day just to critique stuff about how I looked in photos, or, like, something I shouldn't wear, and I was like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what Nance does to me all day e'r'day. Khloe and I are having so much fun calling her Nancy, 'cause she has no idea who we're talking about. There's only so much our souls can handle when it comes to Kim, with her criticism, day after day. And if she's gonna mess with us, then we're gonna mess with her back. &gt;&gt; KIM: What does this Nancy do that annoys you guys so much, why you always talk about her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's just very judgmental. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And it's really obnoxious. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's annoying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to fix the lock on my door. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I feel like the handle on this door isn't working. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: All right, no worries. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing now? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just making some more improvements to your house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you don't need to make improvements to my house. What are you guys doing this time? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just the door here. The handle. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This handle? You keep changing door handles and making doors sound quieter and noisier. &gt;&gt; KIM: But isn't that an improvement? Don't tell me it's not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but I thought... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, can we fix the paint? Sorry, can we fix the paint above it? &gt;&gt; JOSEPH: Yes, we... Yeah, absolutely. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. At least I'm, like, meticulous and I notice these things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When Kim and Kanye first moved in, I really wanted them to be so happy and comfortable that I was afraid to say anything because I didn't want to hurt their feelings. But Kim has really started to take this a little too far. I'm secretly counting the days to when their house is finally complete. Kim, if he was at your house right now doing his thing, and if you would stop nit-picking my house apart, you could move in faster. How much longer are you gonna be here? Because he's here. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's gonna be a while. I know, it's gonna be a while. I'm moving in, in like eight 449 00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,656 months. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Eight months? You rolled in here and it's like this suddenly became your home. It was supposed to be... six weeks. &gt;&gt; KIM: You asked me to move in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been trying to be patient about this whole thing, but eight months? This is not what I signed up for. &gt;&gt; KIM: Trust me, when I'm gone, you'll love it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you're taking over my whole house. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. It's Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. It's Kris Jenner, and I want to talk to somebody really loud, because my daughter's taking all of her calls here like this is her office. Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kanye wants us to all be in San Francisco for a surprise. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know what the surprise is? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want you to say one word. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Lamar. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I wanted to know if it was okay that... since I kind of set this little private bed up for myself... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You set a bed up for yourself? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, and I have Leopard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you have Leopard? Leopard is my very favorite blanket. I bring my blanket everywhere. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, look at this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Leopard. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Leopard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to spend time with him, I want to be there and make sure he's okay. But right now, with everything going on, I really have to stand my ground and really have a lot of boundaries. Maybe this will be a wake-up call for Lamar. Okay, well, that's good you have Leopard. Leopard's the best. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, he's the best. Is that too much info? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm happy you have Leopard. Leopard will make you feel comfortable. I... see, I have to go, 'cause I'm not paying attention, apparently. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, that was really bad. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's okay... you go and... you know, me and Leopard have a date. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You and Leopard have a date. I'll call you when I get to Kris Jenner's. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my leggings. &gt;&gt; KRIS: These are yours? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do I have to pick up your little clothes for you, sweetie, like you're five? Like when you were a little girl? &gt;&gt; KIM: I left one workout pants and a top, by accident... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...because I was showering in here. My clothes, I keep all my clothes in that tiny closet. Very contained. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That closet's the size of a closet of a normal person. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but I'm saying I'm not a normal person. I have tons of clothes. And there's no storage space, so I have no choice but to keep my makeup up here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I just have one drawer, I efficiently put... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, and my shampoos and stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your shampoos? I had two shampoo situations in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Because with the blonde hair, I need a special kind of shampoo now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want you to be really... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm roughing it here. My eyes have to look at these floors. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Roughing it? &gt;&gt; KIM: And this fabric of this couch every single day. Yeah. Once I move in to my house, you're gonna be, like... "I need to redo my house. Kim's house is so cool." &gt;&gt; KRIS: She doesn't like my bedding, she doesn't like the way my towels feel. She completely took over my bathroom, and this situation is driving me crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. It's Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no, m-maybe I'll make a call, too, at the same time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, this is a serious question. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! This is Kris Jenner calling, and I want to talk to somebody really loud because my daughter's sitting in my bathroom and she won't leave me alone and she's taking all of her calls here like I'm her assistant and this is her office. Big kicks for Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: You look like a lunatic. This is a business partner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim's on a call, Kim's on a call. You are so important, Kim. I am really at my wit's end. I can barely find a corner of the house to have for myself for two inches of privacy. I have to do something about this. &gt;&gt; KIM: You tell me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Since you took all of your makeup and put it all in my containers... Ooh, who knew they still made these? &gt;&gt; KIM: If it won't hurt me, I think I'll start it. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. We have to go now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, that is so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, do you have any more calls you need to make? Is there anything I can bring you, princess? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not a princess. I'm like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, just let me know so I don't interrupt you the my 546 00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:22,278 bathroom. See you, eight more months. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is going on? Why are you dressed like this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is how we just get dressed. Tinker Bell, Disco Diva. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kourtney wore this to Disney World. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wedding cake topper, and cheese ball from circa 2003. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am having way too much fun with this Nancy business, so we have recruited Kendall and Kylie and we are all dressing up in really offensive, obnoxious outfits and just having a little fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think Nancy would ever wear anything like this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who, Nahncy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nahncy. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was, like, New Year's a couple years ago. 561 00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:05,174 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Exactly, you think you're so Fahncy Nahncy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Am I really Nancy? It's not right to do to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? What's not right to do to you? &gt;&gt; KIM: You can't, like, make jokes about a "Nancy." Just tell me, Khlo. You... Out of all of them, you'll tell me. 568 00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:26,556 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are Nancy. Yeah, you're Nancy. &gt;&gt; KIM: If everyone had a problem with how I was acting, they could have just talked to me about it and I would have made an adjustment. But having every sister in on this joke where they're making fun of me, it hurts my feelings. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have to go to Kim's house and speed up this little building process. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom is going behind Kim's back. I think that's only gonna add fuel to the fire. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You really think this is your house. 579 00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,744 &gt;&gt; KIM: If you want us out, we'll go. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fahncy Nahncy! &gt;&gt; KIM: No, am I really Nancy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are Nancy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will tell you. Yeah, you're Nancy. Does it bother you that you're Nancy? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We just feel like you're a little too judgmental. You don't have anything else to do besides be a new mom. Now when we refer to you, we refer to you as Nahncy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Making fun of me at the house, always talking about Nancy, it's rude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We just thought it was funny that you never picked it up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm kind of hurt, you 594 00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:34,038 guys. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim just sent an e-mail that she feels bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now I feel bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I mean, she... was being, like, bitchy this whole time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I'm starting to feel a little bit bad about this whole Nancy thing. But she's been brutal the past few months, and she deserves it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, yeah, we might be, like, "She's such a bitch," but it's, like, in good fun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Um, all right, I am getting dressed for din-din. 'Cause my boobs are out of control. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think I might have walking pneumonia. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's stress. I'm sorry you're sick and that you have to be my sidekick today, but I need to go to Kim's house, and I'm gonna talk to the contractor and see if... he will speed up this little building process, because I can't take it anymore. I will literally pay them more money to hurry up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it's a house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't rush a house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you can. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you mean? It's Kim's house-- like, she wants it done perfectly. I wouldn't rush a job. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But she's living at my house, and I feel like she's not over there paying attention. We are gonna be two squeaky wheels when we get to Kim's house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not squeakin' nothin'. I'm just sitting here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, do you know I lived in my house through all of the construction? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure you were so annoying to the workers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, they got it done faster 'cause they wanted to get out of there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Probably. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly my point. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just don't get why I always am dragged along for everything. And, like, I'm gonna get in trouble now. Like, 'cause Kim is gonna find out; she is gonna be pissed. Even though Kim is being so annoying, I don't want to be dragged in the middle because I do feel really bad that all of us were basically talking about her, so I don't need any more drama with Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Somebody's got to take charge of some of these situations, and I seem to be the only one with enough balls to get stuff done. Fill up the Dumpster and get out of here. When do you think that the house is gonna be finished? &gt;&gt; MADELINE: I think it's gonna take a while. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're in big trouble. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kanye is gonna send a private plane-- he wants us all in San Fran for Kim's birthday. I feel like it's something maje. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This place looks no different than it did the last time I was here. Nothing seems to be happening. See all this wood? I need it to disappear. See what I mean? It's, like, fill up the Dumpster and get out of here. They're even adding on more rooms, Khloe. Like, look up there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've seen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're in big trouble. Look, there's no walls. It's a little windy in this house. And who knew that it was this undone? Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; MADELINE: I'm good. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good! &gt;&gt; MADELINE: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nice to meet you. I'm Kris. This is Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you do? &gt;&gt; MADELINE: I'm a contractor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So when do you think that the house is gonna be finished, in your opinion? &gt;&gt; MADELINE: I think it's gonna take a while because you're changing and making a traditional house a contemporary house, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; MADELINE: Within its own footprint. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. Do you think it's at the place now where they can start putting it back together? &gt;&gt; MADELINE: Probably not, because they have a lot of mechanical issues. Some of it's time-consuming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hmm. &gt;&gt; MADELINE: It's very frustrating for the owner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And the owner's mother. &gt;&gt; MADELINE: And the owner's mother. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not one who throws in the towel so easily. Oh, my God, there's no walls or windows in her bedroom, either. Oh, wow. We're starting over with the kitchen? &gt;&gt; MADELINE: And the staircase is being moved. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But actually seeing it with my very own eyes, I realize this house won't be ready for a super long time. : What are we gonna do now? It's, like, this house is never gonna be done. There's hardly even any walls or windows. There's not... Look, it's down to the studs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, if you have an issue, go talk to Kim about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you should have a talk with her and say, "Listen." You're a little concerned. You're gonna have to say that you came here and you saw this, and that you're a little concerned and that you guys should go talk. You're the one who begged Kim to come and move with you. : And you want to be with the baby while Kim and Kanye are on tour. 690 00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:26,078 So, like, you're getting what you asked for. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you're cheerful. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you have something to tell me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: About what? &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you call my contractor behind my back? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well... yeah, we had a chat. I just wanted to find out if we could move this train along because it seems to be taking a really long time. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, you don't think that I've already thought of that? There's nothing we can do to make it go any quicker. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You could stop making changes. Every five minutes, you make another change. Get it, like, organized so that you guys can move in and you can do the rest while you're living there like I did. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom is trying to kick me out of her house. Kourtney and Khloe are ganging up on me again and always picking on me. I mean, what did I do to anyone? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes I feel like I'm tiptoeing around my own house. I feel bad if the phone rings because I don't want anybody to disturb the baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you invited us. You would always say to me that it takes forever for a house project to even happen. You knew what you were getting yourself into. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is never going to end. I feel like-like you're my mom. I feel bad if I mess up your stuff in my bathroom. And you walk in and you go, "Who took my shampoo out of the shower?" Wait. It-It's my shower. &gt;&gt; KIM: Every time we have a conversation about anything, you're always laughing and joking, and, like, that's why I can't even take you seriously. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like I have to ask for your permission to go anywhere, or have to ask for your permission to have people over for dinner. I think you really think that... that this is your house and I'm your houseguest. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you want us out, we'll go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I invited Malika, Dijah. Rob is going. We just need to make sure that we do not ruin the surprise. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, I can keep a secret. 731 00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:34,569 &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you guys talking about? &gt;&gt; KIM: If you want us out, we'll go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, it's not that I don't want you here. I want you here. I want to be with the baby, I want to be with Kanye and you, but it's, at some point, gotta be on my terms. Like it's still my house. I come home and everything's different. Like, you come in and you criticize. But this is what I like. And when you get your house done, I may come over to your house and I might not like everything that you do. And how would you like it if I started rearranging your whole house? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'd kill you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. I know that you don't like everything here, but everything in this house represents something I did all on my own. Something I'm really proud of. And it's my taste, and I love my stuff. I love you for wanting me to be better, but I like the way I live. I'm really happy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel really bad. I am just so comfortable around my own family that I don't think it's a big deal when I voice my opinion. I feel like I have just been giving everyone constructive criticism, but I guess it wasn't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want you to leave, but I just think that maybe some boundaries would be good. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I definitely don't want you to feel uncomfortable in your own house, and I want to definitely establish boundaries. So I just want you to tell me what they are, and then we'll go from there. It's that easy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Well, I've got to get some work done, so is it okay if I go use my office? Is that all right with you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It would be, but I'm actually using it as my third closet, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll see about that, missy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just kidding! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Anthony! &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: I'm calling from San Fran. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How is it up there? &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: Amazing. Always. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: You know how Kanye is having his concert in San Francisco this week? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I'm coming. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: Okay, well, he can't get back down to L.A., so he wants to throw, like, a massive surprise party for Kim here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? For her birthday? &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. So he's gonna have a party? &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: Yeah. I can't tell you where it is because he really doesn't want anybody to know. It's so big and over the top that we really need your help getting everybody down here. He wants all of Kim's friends, all the family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, that's in, like, four days. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: Well, that's why we're calling you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bring in the troops! I love the fact that Kanye wants to surprise Kim, but I wasn't born yesterday, and I know there's a lot more to this story than they're telling me, and I'm gonna get to the bottom of it. Whatever you guys have up your sleeve, I bet it's gonna be amazing. I know you know, Anthony, and you're just not telling me. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: I can't really tell. My lips are sealed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, apparently they are. With superglue. This is so exciting. I love surprising people. She will die. &gt;&gt; ANTHONY: I know, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She will die. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, it's Mommy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. It says that on my caller I.D. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so, here's the deal. I don't want you to say one word to anybody, but I just got a call and Kanye wants us to all be in San Francisco for Kim's birthday for a surprise. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know what the surprise is? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a birthday surprise. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. What do we wear? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, he said he wants it to be, like, black tie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo-hoo! Kim's birthday bash. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo... Okay. Party. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you. 810 00:38:32,973 --> 00:38:36,475 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MASON: Mom! Mom! Who is strong enough? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who is strong? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Oh, look at that pirate ship. &gt;&gt; MASON: Like... Rum! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rum! 817 00:38:56,857 --> 00:39:01,960 &gt;&gt; KIM: So... I just wanted to apologize for being judgmental. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like you kind of purposely, like, made comments like, "Ugh, you guys bring me down with your style" or whatever, you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. I mean, I just feel bad and I'm so sorry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I feel bad, like, participating in the Nancy business. I feel, like, when you're a new mom, like, your whole life changes, and then you kind of feel like no one relates to you anyways. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, I feel, like, out of anyone, you know, I should be... more understanding. &gt;&gt; MASON: Ma, can you grab that book for me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim was being a little bit mean, but, as a new mom, I know what she's going through and, if anything, I should be there for her instead of being a little teenager calling her Nancy. Mean of us. And we don't want to be like that, so... &gt;&gt; KIM: You just can't help yourself? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We couldn't. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Picture of Dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's from Dorsey High School. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The reunion, I think. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is not Dad. Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you think? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look what he looked like. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who is this bitch posing with Dad? Do you know who that whore is? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Skank. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here's a letter from your dad. dad? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It says, "Good to have known you these past 15 years. They've been loaded with a lot of laughs. Let's keep smiling for 140 more. Always, your roommate, O.J." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Should I Instagram that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Mom called me and said Kanye is gonna send a private plane. He wants us all in San Fran for Kim's birthday. And it's a major surprise. We can't say a word. And he said we have to wear black tie. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Black tie is fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That doesn't make you nervous? You don't, like, wonder what it's for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, uh, for her birthday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In my gut, I feel like something big is about to happen. And I think the weirdest part is that Kourtney doesn't think anything is gonna happen. Like, she's just like, "Nope, we're just going for her birthday." Like, no. You don't think it could be something deeper? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, last year, he literally surprised her, took her to Rome. He's, like, into birthdays and surprises. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you dumb! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, that's cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why on Earth last minute would you want all of us to go to San Francisco? And it's a surprise, and dress black tie? Like, Robert's going. If our brother's going... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is he, though? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...I know it's big. I just feel like maybe this is a proposal. 879 00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:49,579 I'm a little psychic. I feel like it's something maje.
