- &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Tonight on <i>Keeping</i> <i>Up with the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: Vegas, baby. Okay, bye, guys. I love you, but I got to go. I have to go back to work. I'll see you later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Vegas is always a lot of fun, but tonight we're here to work. &gt;&gt; ROB: Whatever. Scott and I are here to have fun. We're in Vegas. We're here to get drunk, have a good time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm ready to do some bad things tonight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Turn off the &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now, Scott... &gt;&gt; MAN: Get off of me! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott! Scott! Stop it, Scott. Stop it. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Back off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't youtalk to me like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hate him. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow, thank you. I'm famished. How is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh... my God. This is really good. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Always the little restaurants have the best, like, food. I'm excited about your birthday. Except I ran into Mike Snedegar. He told me you weren't having the party this year. &gt;&gt; KIM: He called me and said, you know, do I want to do my party at Tao this year, and I said, "Yeah, of course. Call my mom." I called my mom and I gave her the heads up. And I said, "I want to do this party at at Tao." &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I guess she didn't get back to him, because when I said it to him, I was like, "We're going to Vegas." He was like confused. Because he was like, "For who?" And I'm like, "Kim's birthday." And he's like, "Well, her mom said she's not doing it." &gt;&gt; KIM: She should have booked it and locked it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, well... &gt;&gt; KIM: This was like two weeks ago. For the last couple of years I've always worked on my birthday in Vegas. And Mike is a really good friend of mine, and I promised him that I'd do it this year. This is work-- I'm not going to turn it down. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: After we spoke the last time, we were like, "We're definitely going to Vegas." I like, told everyone. &gt;&gt; KIM: I gave him my word. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah. It's bad for your business. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a bad business... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's a bad look. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: 'Cause you look like liar. He probably thinks you're full of &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, seriously. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, I would. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to be one of those full ofpeople that just say, "Oh, yeah, sure, I'll do it, I'll do it." &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: "Yeah, call my people." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. And then my people say no when I said yes. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Your mom is nuts. I literally hopes she doesn't turn you into MC Hammer. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Kim's career-- cold case filed. The criminal-- Kris. She's literally like the shooter. &gt;&gt; KIM: She murdered me. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She murdered you andhid. She didn't even tell you that she was canceling your birthday. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, why did you tell Mike that I'm not doing my party at Tao? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you work 364 days a year. It's like a bit much. And he wanted you to come for your birthday? Kim makes it sound like I've canceled her birthday celebration... when, in fact, it's an appearance. She's got to be on a schedule. She's got to do a red carpet. She's got to do a meet-and-greet. She's got to stay for a certain amount of time. And Kim has been working so hard, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm endorsing products right now. I have my own products. I have my foot in the door in fashion. &gt;&gt; FASHION EDITOR: Usually the hair is always down. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, always. &gt;&gt; EDITOR: And this year you're going a little bit up. I mean, it's still a little bit down in front. What made you change your mind on that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Lessen that length. Good thick fabric. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Of course I'm going to turn it down. She needs a break, at least on her birthday. &gt;&gt; KIM: I made a promise to Mike. I verbally said yes, I'm doing my birthday party at Tao. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just trying to watch out for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: But he's my friend, and then you go and say no, and it makes me look bad-- it makes you look bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The next morning you have your Carl's Jr. commercial shoot. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I know that, and I usually wouldn't book that, but I gave him my word. So, this is the one exception where I would do that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you're going to go to Vegas? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's not who you are, Kim. You don't go without sleep. You're going to have to bring all my meetings with you if you want this to happen. How's that for you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Fine, fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll have you work on your birthday. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna bring Keith Frankel. We're gonna bring the GNC guys, because that's who I was supposed to be meeting with that weekend. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll be fine. Trust me. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Superwoman. You're not made of steel, Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What shall we get? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that looks good and healthy. A little peppers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Since when are you into all this healthy food? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, since you were pregnant, and I want you to be healthy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Interesting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I've definitely seen a huge change in Scott. Somewhere along the line, something just clicked in his head, and he's been really excited to be a father. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you want to do all the walls the same? Like the ceiling white and the walls gray? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like that you're into this. Scott has been working for the company that makes QuickTrim, and he's been getting up every day, going to work, getting up early. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right now we're just basically reaching out to people that we like to endorse the product. &gt;&gt; NICOLE: Um, I'm interested in it. I mean, you know, I think that things like that work. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't we get a proposal together, put some stuff on paper-- what we could offer you. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll get in that bikini, too, if I have to. &gt;&gt; MAN: We just might need you to. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just see such a change in him. He makes me feel like I have a real partner in life. He's definitely on the right track. Doll, that was nice. I love that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why does QuickTrim have boobs on it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Boobs? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's Kim's real body. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where? Is that her butt? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Boobs. It's not a butt. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, boobs. I thought it was her butt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think that's her belly button. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right, Scott? You're the new QuickTrim guy. Come on. Didn't we do Kim's body on this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's Kim's body all right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A month ago, I got Scott a job with my new business partners, and this is really, really important to me. And I have a lot at stake here. Trust me, this guy can talk. You know, sometimes he just doesn't even shut up. I mean, maybe he can work on a new tanning product. Or like a sunscreen. He'd be good at that. &gt;&gt; KEITH: Well, let's give it a whack. I trust you. And he's family, so got to make it work. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, you're telling me we got to make it work. Thank God you finally have like a real job. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you don't just keep doing whatever it was you were doing. I mean honestly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, let's not dwell on the past. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want him to be successful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He is. He's great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And to be motivated to do something great. And I think this is a really good start for him, that's all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom is so critical of Scott, and always making rude comments about him. And you'd think that now with him having a daily job, she would just back off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Lamar's set for life. He's got his thing. He's talented-- he's got his basketball. And then there's Reggie who's got his whole football career. And he's young and still on top of his game. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And by the way, Robert is developing a whole skin care line. They're taken care of. I mean, they're set. I just want Scott to succeed, and I push him, because I don't think he has anybody else doing that for him. I want my daughter and my grandchild to have a great life also, and to be, you know, the best that they can be. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I honestly feel like no matter what I do in this family, no matter what I achieve, I'll never be what Kris wants. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can bull- with the best of 'em. So use your gift. Show us that you have some initiative. Like, take the ball and run with it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's not retarded. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you done, honey, on the poor guy? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. The nicest penthouse suite. I mean, this is what it's all about. &gt;&gt; ROB: Let's talk about how much my mom dislikes you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's the last thing I want to think about, is Kris Jenner right now. How many drinks do you think we can get in us before dinner? &gt;&gt; ROB: That guy just gave me the eye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm ready to do some bad things tonight. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Vegas, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. How are you? So we all just arrived except for Khloe, who's gonna go to Lamar's game tonight, then meet us here later. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; MAN: Hello, welcome to penthouse suite. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; MAN: Very good. It's about 8,000 square feet. &gt;&gt; KIM: 8,000 square feet?! Oh, my God. Let me go get my dresses and hang them. You can give the lush the champagne. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: They have it all hooked up for me. I mean, the nicest penthouse suite. I mean, this is what it's all about. This is what I work so hard for. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: There's a whole movie theatre in here. Look at the walls in here, it's crazy. &gt;&gt; ROB: Farewell, my friends. ♫ ♫ I understand Kim's hosting her big birthday bash. Whatever, Scott and I are here to have fun. We're in Vegas, we're gonna get drunk and have fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, drink up already. &gt;&gt; Look at this, you don't even have to ask. &gt;&gt; ROB: I wasn't going to! &gt;&gt; I'll trade you. &gt;&gt; ROB: I never do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you get this little kid a beer, too, while you're at it? Appreciate it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I literally just want, like, ten minutes. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You gonna lay down? &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously, how exhausting. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm dead. Imagine if we like, fell asleep and missed your entire birthday party? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, that would be... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: How funny would that be? &gt;&gt; KIM: Awful. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'll wake you up in four minutes and twenty seconds. Who theis this now? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; DAWN: Hi, Kim, how you feeling? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; DAWN: Good. Did you have a good day today? &gt;&gt; KIM: I did. &gt;&gt; DAWN: Good. We're gonna send somebody up to pick you up at around 8:15. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; DAWN: We'll escort you down to Tao, where you're gonna go ahead and you'll do your red carpet and you'll do media interviews; at around 8:45, you'll go into your dinner at, um, the restaurant. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; DAWN: And then after the dinner for your birthday, we'll head up to the Tao Nightclub, where you'll be hosting your birthday party celebration. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; DAWN: It's a lot of work. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, thank you. I'm gonna try and take, like, a five-minute nap. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Thank you. Do you think you could have somebody wake us up in about two-and-a-half minutes? &gt;&gt; DAWN: Absolutely. Oh, not a problem. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Two-and-a half minutes. &gt;&gt; DAWN: Two-and-a-half minutes, you got it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; DAWN: Okay. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's like 2:00 in the afternoon. How many beers did you drink out of the minifridge before we came down here? &gt;&gt; ROB: Scottie, now that I got you drunk, let's talk about how much my mom dislikes you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's the last thing I want to think about, is Kris Jenner right now. Anything to do with her puts me in a complete different mood. It's literally impossible to please that woman. Why am I even gonna bother? It doesn't matter what I do, there's always been something about me that she's never been fond of. And it comes to a point, it's like, can I ever change that opinion of hers? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's kind of like, you just have accepted the fact that she hates you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. Yello? Wouldn't mind a little drink here. Not talking to you, Balzac. Patron extra cold. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: You got it. Here you go, hon. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, shall we? &gt;&gt; ROB: You do salt first? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Drink up, why don't you, and then I'll tell you. How many drinks you think we can get in us before dinner? Or do you not want to drink too much before dinner? &gt;&gt; ROB: Wait, Keith Frankel's gonna be there today. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're in Vegas, dude, relax. Nothing bad's gonna happen. &gt;&gt; ROB: That guy just gave me the eye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, I'm ready to do some bad things tonight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Where are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Here! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's your birthday, not ours. &gt;&gt; KIM: At 8:15, I have to start working again. I have to be in hair and makeup by 5:00. It's 4:00 right now. I want to go shopping, and I want to just have some time for myself, something fun for me to do; it is my birthday. I'm allowed to have a little fun after all. I never get time off. I just need, like, these ten minutes just to buy a few things for myself is amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, look at this bag. Like, if you had a little girl. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is for Suri Cruise. &gt;&gt; KIM:Wait, there's one more pair up here that I need to see. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: The blue? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Khloe, tell me again what's going on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously, don't irritate me. Just pay attention, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The point is, you still have to come. Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm focusing on my husband who's injured. I'm still coming there, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, okay. Love you. Her husband. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: <i>My</i> husband! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. Weird, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't have a lot of time. I have like five minutes left. Hair and makeup starts in, like, 25 minutes. Okay, bye, guys. I love you, but I gotta go. I have to go back to work. I'll see you later. Do you want to walk back with me? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, we were coming, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna have to work, Mom; I'll see you there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, honestly. Like, seriously? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna go get my hair and makeup done. &gt;&gt; ROB: Happy Birthday. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Seriously, where is everybody? &gt;&gt; JJ: I just got here, man. I'd like a room situation. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here's your room situation. &gt;&gt; ROB: Geez, Scottie. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, how you doing? Yeah. Can we get a couple beers up here? &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott. &gt;&gt; JJ: Hey, come on. Jeez. Dude, dude, dude. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, no, no, no, no! &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Kourtney and I are getting our hair and makeup done for tonight, and we hear crazy noise from outside. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sick of this &gt;&gt; JJ: Dude, all right. All right, all right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A pillow fight! Oh, that's gonna leave a mark. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not annoying at all! &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, I'm gonna go downstairs. Come with me, then. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not gonna go anywhere. &gt;&gt; ROB: Be right back. I decided to call this good friend of mine who lives in Vegas to meet up with us in the hotel. How you doing? &gt;&gt; PAULA: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; ROB: This girl, she's a female acquaintance. We decide to hang out in Paula's room while the girls finish getting ready upstairs. &gt;&gt; JJ: But I know that last week, he said that he had something lined up here, so... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And when he says lined up, he means he got a hooker. &gt;&gt; JJ: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: His friend is probably a hooker. &gt;&gt; JJ: She's not a hooker. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. 'Cause he's not paying by the hour? &gt;&gt; JJ: What are the chances she's a friend? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's a hooker. Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, buddy. What do you guys want? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's it going? &gt;&gt; PAULA: Hi. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is one of my good friends. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course it is. We all call them that. What's going on? &gt;&gt; PAULA: With what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, good-looking kid. You look like his sister. &gt;&gt; PAULA: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's see what they look like over Rob's shoulders. I came here to watch you guys have sex. Are you gonna? Yes or no? If you don'ther, JJ is. &gt;&gt; JJ: No, he's not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, you probably got half a ... &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's ready to have Rob's meat raw. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, so why don't you guys leave? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why would we? &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, Scottie. I don't want to fight you right now. Scott is so wasted, it's like he's possessed or something. He is being a stupid, drunk guy. I mean, he's just gotta chill out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look, I understand you guys are interested in doing what you gotta do, and I'm fine with it. Don't look at my sweetheart. &gt;&gt; PAULA: I'm not looking at anything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You look at your boyfriend's. Don't be a Take your shirt off and her. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, this isn't happening. You need to leave. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I totally will. Where's she going?

Scott completely made this super awkward. I appreciate that, buddy. Appreciate it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what happens. one hooker, and then you're a professional. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it, stop it. What the hell is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott has lost his mind. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Back off. Back off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where do you want me to go? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott? &gt;&gt; JJ: He's passed out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott's asleep.

I'mpissed! Kourtney, come back here with my child! Come back here with my child now! &gt;&gt; ROB: Don't spray that, dude, dude! Are you serious?! Are you serious? Oh, my gosh, are you kidding? Dude, that's so... &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you guys do this in the other room, not where we're doing hair and makeup? Ow, you justhit him. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ow, my ear! Get off of me! Ow, my ear! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What theis going on in here? Seriously, dude. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my-- dude, it's gotta be bleeding. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here for work, and this is serious. They just think it's some kind of joke. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I could totally puke in this right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's so rude. You're acting like drunk slob kabobs, and Kim doesn't want drunks, wasted people at her dinner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's no problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But you're here for her birthday. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you should respect that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And not be getting wasted. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why are you getting down on us? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're worse than Rob. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm worse than Rob? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, you're worse than Rob. When you sober up... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That'll never happen. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so then you can't come to dinner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you. Does it matter that I love you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you sober up, then we can talk. Not only is Scott ruining Kim's birthday, but his boss is gonna be here, and he could totally lose his job. My mom's on her way back up. Sober up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My own girlfriend's telling me what to do? It's Vegas, have some fun, lighten up. Where are we going to dinner? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hope everybody's on time tonight because this is a major business dinner, and I'm trying to get our products sold across the country. Everyone's gotta be on their game. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh-oh, got a delivery! &gt;&gt; JJ: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! When did you get here? &gt;&gt; JJ: Jeez. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What the? Stop it, stop it. What the hell is going on here? Scott, get off the floor. Stop it. Scott? Scott? Scott, get in your room, please, 'cause Keith is gonna be here in a second. You're not gonna have a job, so why don't you go to the room and just save yourself a lot of embarrassment? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney isn't here, she's crying in the other room. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know what, Kourtney knew exactly the person she was with when she met me, and I will never take back the things that I do when I need to do them. &gt;&gt; JJ: Jeez. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. Stop it. Scott, you just... Stop it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it, Scott. What the hell is going on here? You just got champagne all over me, and I just got dressed. I'm not...

I can't afford to deal with this right now. &gt;&gt; ROB: He hurt me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is going on here? &gt;&gt; ROB: They hurt me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're ready to go to Kim's birthday; what the hell is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know what they did to me, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. What is wrong? Can you come here and tell me what's going on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob and Scott are not coming to dinner, 'cause they're annoying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He needs to go lie down. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't control him, so he can do whatever the he wants and I... he's not coming to dinner and I don't need to hang around losers like that. They're acting like drunken idiots. There's no way they're coming to Kim's birthday dinner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We are leaving in ten minutes for dinner, Rob, get dressed. You don't have a choice. I'm not kidding, Robert. JJ, if you get dressed, I'd love for you to join us for dinner. Robert, it is your sister's birthday. Get yourclothes on right now. I'm not kidding. Get thedressed. JJ, can you go get your friend dressed, please? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob's not coming to dinner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob's not allowed to go to dinner! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Keith. Good. Where have you been? Did you disappear? Yeah, come on up, 35105. Oh, I would laugh, Scott, that's really funny. I'm not kidding. I'm disappointed in you. I think that you allow yourself to be just influenced by people that make bad decisions. You're ruining your sister's birthday. I'm really upset. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom, we're joking around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not joking around, Robert. Go to your room, please. Either rinse off and get... &gt;&gt; ROB: Go to my room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. Rob does not act this way. My son does not behave this poorly, especially when he knows that a night is so important to me. Is that for real, what's going on out there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yep. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I will never, ever have Scott on one of these trips again. Do you hear me? What time does the plane leave Los Angeles. &gt;&gt; KIM: Noon. Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: One of the pilots got sick, and we called for a new pilot. &gt;&gt; KIM: What, then I need to get home. I have a 9:00 appointment. I have my Carl's Jr. commercial tomorrow. I can't miss it. I have to be on time. It's not acceptable if I'm not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll all get on a 6:00 plane with you. Things are going wrong left and right, and I'm just trying to remain calm. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, do we not have a private plane? We need to get home. I need to be home by, like, 8:00 latest. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, what we need to do is get somebody to get us two tickets home at 6:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; KIM: Three 'cause Britney's coming with me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, three. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have all these shopping bags. That's the only reason why I brought them, why I bought the stuff and not have it shipped, 'cause I thought I was going in a private plane, and I'd be okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right now I'm dealing with my son who's drunk off his ass, you, who wants a private plane because her bags won't fit on a commercial flight, and I'm dealing with Khloe missing her flight, having an expired license, so she can't get on a plane. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's a-up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so let me just go have a glass of champagne or something to kind of calm my nerves. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I'm dealing with a mother who's a drunk. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, no, actually, your mother's not a drunk. I seem to be the only one who has a head on their shoulders today. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, really. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here to work. I'm not even here to celebrate my birthday. I don't even care. I'm not here to even enjoy my birthday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you think I'm here to do? I didn't come here for a piece of cake, honey. I came here because we have things to do, all right? &gt;&gt; ROB: What theare you doing out here? Get inside! Dude, you got me in trouble, and now you're gonna pay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, now, Keith is coming up right now. Scott, Scott. Scott! Get in your room, please, 'cause Keith is gonna be here in a second. You're not gonna have a job, so why don't you go to the room and save yourself a lot of embarrassment, please? Keith and Tom Dowd from GNC are on their way up to the room, and these guys are out of control. I have to figure out a way to fix this and fix it now. I hate him. I hate him. He's going toup my... Get to your... Scott, Scott? Scott. Scott! Scott, do you really want to ruin your life like this? Do you want to... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's the police, isn't it? Don't look at them in their eye if they're there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott, get to your room. Hi! How are you? Good to see you. &gt;&gt; TOM: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think Scott really understands the magnitude of what he's gotten himself into. This is a huge business deal for us, and now he is going to jeopardize not only his own job, but now he's messing with my whole family. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Listen, it's seven months old. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, way more mature than you are. Yeah, okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Listen to me, listen to me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you, I do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. Ugh, you reek. You look like Your eyes look like you aged about 20 years. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying to catch up to your old age. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here's Keith. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Keith! &gt;&gt; KEITH: You're on in five. Five minutes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He looks like he aged about 20 years today. &gt;&gt; KEITH: Well, he worked two days in a row. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Since Scott's a drunk slob, he's gonna shower and just sleep it off, and the rest of us are gonna go to Kim's birthday dinner and have a great time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Somebody better come in here and tug this 'cause the old wife won't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Take a shower and take a nap and don't come to dinner or out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You like that, boys?! I'm gonna tell you right now, if I go to bed, I'll be out for two days. &gt;&gt; JJ: Are you allowed to dinner? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm a liability, my brother. &gt;&gt; JJ: Of course you are. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not allowed anywhere. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Who's here? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's always good. You'll probably hate it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, Robert sobered up enough to come out to dinner with us, and thank God Scott's not here. Finally, we can just have our business meeting and celebrate Kim's birthday. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have a story for you guys. Rob, you can listen, too. So, I go to the... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God, I think I'm gonna kill him. What is Scott doing at this birthday dinner? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yo! You're aplanet! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What Scott really wants to be doing is do to me what he's doing to the waiter. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Back off. Back off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Back where? Where do you want me to go? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yo! I love you! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Put him next to you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? I don't know what to do. I know that Scott's acting out of control, but what am I supposed to do about it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, man, that was a lot of excitement. How's my hair? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What in the world is Scott doing at this birthday dinner? He's in no condition to be at this table. Scott is making my business partner really, really uncomfortable. You can't hear in here 'cause somebody's yelling too loud. I hope you lose your voice. My prayer in my life is that you lose your voice. &gt;&gt; TOM: Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is such a nightmare. I totally thought he'd changed, and he's such achild. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would like to make a toast. What are you drinking? What are you drinking? Excuse me, he can only have water. No more drinks. He gets nothing else alcoholic. &gt;&gt; TOM: ...drinks, cut him off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I knew I had a problem. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thisguy is cutting me off over here. I will beat theout of thisguy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is going on? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Absolutely. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott is threatening the waiter and in his face. The scariest thing is that what Scott really wants to be doing is do to me what he's doing to the waiter. 'Cause Scott knows I'm the one who cut him off. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Please, back off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don'ttalk to me like that. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Excuse me, I'm not talking to you anyway. Back off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Back where? &gt;&gt; Back off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where do you want me to go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I seriously think Scott has lost his mind. He's scaring me right now. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not gonna go tell him anything. I'm not talking to him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want them to arrest him? They're ready to arrest him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need to do what's best for me and my baby. I'm pregnant, I don't need to be dealing with this, so I'm done. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Back where? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, do something! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What am I gonna do? &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you see what he did? He took a hundred-dollar bill, and he shoved it in his mouth and goes "shut theup." &gt;&gt; ROB: When I see Scott shove the hundred-dollar bill down the waiter's throat, that sobered me up fast. I do not want to be that guy. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not Kourtney's fault. It's not Kourtney's fault. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, sit down. &gt;&gt; Calm down, calm down, calm down. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you see what he said to that waiter? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't make it a big deal. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's just humiliating in front of the business-- the head of GNC and the owner of QuickTrim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to ask... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not gonna go... I'm not gonna go tell him anything. I'm not talking to him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Unless they arrest him. Do you want them to arrest him? They're ready to arrest him. They're giving you one last chance. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If that's what they need to do. What do they want me to do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're giving you one last chance... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: To do what? Yeah, shut theup. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney really can't do anything. She's pregnant, she can't really handle him right now, and my mom is just gonna make it worse. I really have to deal with this. Scott, can I talk to you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That guy deserved to get stuffed in his face. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, he-- no one deserves that. It wasn't funny. The guy was about to cry for this, Scott. My mom is screaming, everyone's upset. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your mom is always screaming. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look, I just feel like you're really drunk. Kourtney is in tears; she's crying in the other room. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know what, Kourtney knew exactly the person she was with when she met me, and I will never take back the things that I do when I need to do them. The guy disrespected me, and everybody's lucky I didn't handle the guy in a different situation. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott doesn't get how upset we all are. I just don't think at this point, he really is gonna understand; he's just too drunk. Just go to the room. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not going to the room. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna celebrate this birthday the way I should. 'Cause you don't drink, and I have to for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott, you're drunk. Seriously, get it together. It's not funny. He's just the same. You know, he disrespected him and that the guy deserved it and he should have punched him in the face. We're lucky he didn't beat him. So I said, let me have a security take you down to your room, and he goes, "No, I'm going out tonight." And I'm like, "Kourtney's visibly upset, my mom is furious." He goes, "Well, your mom's always furious, Kourtney's always upset; she knew who I was when she met me." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really cannot believe Scott. He's not even apologizing. I just can't even be around him for another second. I'm done. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel really bad for Kourt. I wish we can leave, but we can't. I'm just exhausted. The last thing I want to do is host this party, but I have to. What's up, Las Vegas?! Help me with my mood and show me how to party my last year in my 20s before I'm 30! Let's party, Las Vegas! ♫ ♫ Thank you! &gt;&gt; KRIS: The second that dinner was over, I flew straight back to Los Angeles all by myself because I wasn't gonna spend one more minute with Scott and that whole situation. It was one of the worst nights of my life. It was one of the worst nights of my life because Scott was so out of control. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What did he do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: First of all, I think he has a drinking problem. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, honey, and you're just figuring that out now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He got so belligerent, and so I asked the waiter not to serve him anymore. Scott orders another drink; the guy won't serve him; Scott got mad, stood up, started screaming at the waiter and shoved a hundred-dollar bill down his throat. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Scott's really lucky that he didn't lose his job or kill my business deal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what? Good thing I wasn't there. I would have decked him. I would have taken him right out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was so bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know why anybody acts like that, especially to other people, but what's, uh, Kourtney gonna do? He's not father material. &gt;&gt; KIM: Now we have to take a commercial flight, which throws everything off because I just bought all that stuff today. I have about... I'd say a good two-and-a-half hour rest. So, I get home from the club at, like, 5:30, and Scott hasn't come back to the room yet. God knows where he is. What kind of man leaves his pregnant girlfriend in Las Vegas all by herself? &gt;&gt; And action! &gt;&gt; KIM: We've been shooting for hours and I'm exhausted and I have to push through this. &gt;&gt; ROB: Are you mad at him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel so bad about last night's events. I feel like Scott, like, ruined your birthday. &gt;&gt; KIM: He did, but... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and I are on our way back home from the airport. I need to do what's best for me and my baby. I'm pregnant; I don't need to be dealing with this, so I'm done. He needs to move to New York. Like, leave me the alone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom will never talk to him ever again. Like, ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I will never talk to him again. &gt;&gt; ROB: You got up, took a hundred bucks, stuffed it in the dude's, going... Something you were saying, and then you just stuffed it in his damn mouth. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't really remember last night; it's a bit blurry and I'm talking to Rob and he's telling me that I made some huge scene over dinner. I remembered dinner, but I didn't think it was that big of a deal. What time did everybody else leave, early? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, just take a shower, pack up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, man. &gt;&gt; MARIO: 'Sup? Where's Kourtney now? Did she go home? &gt;&gt; ROB: She left this morning. &gt;&gt; MARIO: She left without Scott? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, and they were supposed to be... we all were supposed to be on the same flight. I know what Scott did last night was extremely rude and disrespectful, but he's my friend/brother, and I want to help him out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't mess with the Zohan. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, beau. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm just, uh, showered and got dressed and everything. And Scott's showering right now. Are you mad at him? &gt;&gt; KIM: You are like, dressed to go out to, like, a nightclub. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, no, I'm not. You didn't say that when I had this dress on in London. You're very cranky today, Kim. Try and suck it up a little bit. You look a little tired. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I'm back in L.A. I flew in for the Carl's Jr. commercial, which is possibly the biggest career move right now. This is a huge deal. This is something that I've always dreamed of, and I can't believe that it's here. &gt;&gt; MAN: Ready and roll camera. And action, Kim. Nice... and cut. Okay, see this is what we're gonna do 400 times. Action. And action. And action. And cut. Ooh! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I'm just eating and eating and even when the camera stops, I keep on eating and... &gt;&gt; And action. And action. Beautiful. Action. Nice. &gt;&gt; KIM: We've been shooting for hours, and after dealing with Scott, I can hardly keep my eyes open. &gt;&gt; MAN: Beautiful. And cut it. Good. That was great. All right, all right! &gt;&gt; KIM: I've come to the realization that I just can't do everything. I'm always doing so much and I love what I do and I want to please everyone and do everything, but at some point, I just have to take care of myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Kimmy. I want to talk about just your scheduling and stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I'm gonna, you know, take about two weeks off and just stay in New Orleans. I don't want you to book anything for me. I just, I think I should, like, stick to five projects at a time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I tried to tell you to stay, like, at least with three because you can't be everywhere at the same time. I tell Kim over and over, "Take some time off and get some rest." I think Kim has got the message. You need to trust that I actually know what I'm doing at some point. &gt;&gt; KIM: You do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My key isn't working. Can you just let me in? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. I changed the locks. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't need to be here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look, regardless of how you feel, we need to speak to each other. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's the same story. I'm just over hearing it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What same story? It's a completely different story. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so go tell it to someone who cares. You don't get it, and that's exactly why I will not have you as part of my life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney! &gt;&gt; Next on Keeping up with the Kardashians. &gt;&gt; Scott has really crossed the line. I just can't have you in my family. &gt;&gt; My water broke. &gt;&gt; Ew! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The baby's coming, and I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: His head is out. &gt;&gt; You can do it. Push it. Push it. Push it. Yes! Excellent!
