- Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob, are you going to Thailand? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, of course. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where's Rob? Is he coming? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this a joke? Everyone was relying on me to get him to Thailand. 12:15 is looking real good to get the freak out of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's the point of coming all the way out here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, why don't you go take some more selfies? &gt;&gt; KIM: You're, like, a miserable person. You really are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm a miserable person that takes wonderful selfies all day long. This has been the most draining trip I've ever been on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's like the worst feeling in the world when one of your kids isn't in a good place. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Khloe! &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Good. One, two. Two, three, four. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just decided to not go back home. It was too much work. And I don't want to feel the guilt of my family being disappointed that I left, so I stayed in Thailand. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Hey! Right... Kick one, kick, yes! &gt;&gt; BRODY: We got to find Khloe a little Thai-boxing boyfriend so she can train every day. She's got a little natural gift for this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, shut up! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Khloe, you ever heard about, like, you know, when you're in a different area code? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's a different country code. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, now we're in a different country code. You're right. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Not even a boyfriend. Like, a one-night stand. &gt;&gt; KIM: That I wouldn't mind for her. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, just something to, like, cheer her up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, one-- I've never had a vacation fling. Two-- I'm not gonna start here. What I really need is some good old kicking some ass with the boxing gloves and these mitts right here. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Good, good, yeah! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Whoa! Wow! &gt;&gt; KIM: Round one! Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Nice, Kim, nice job. Nice job. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim was waiting her whole life to do that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ♫ B... What you doing ♫ Ah, in Thailand? Here we go ♫ Off to the orphanage And the last one Has just showed up. ♫ &gt;&gt; BRANDON: ♫ She's just shown up. ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ♫ And who could that be? ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it the one with the baby? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: ♫ It's Kimberly. ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ♫ But oh, but you ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: That has to now... find a babysitter. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ♫ We're gonna have Have a-a little fun. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so, guys? Here's what we're bringing. Instant food, and we have fans. Over 25 pillows because they sleep on these little mats. And Kardashian Kids collection. And then some medical supplies and then we have tons of toys, you guys. Visiting this country and actually seeing firsthand some of the devastation that the tsunami left has all of us feeling like we want to do something to help. So, after Mark told us about the orphanage that wasn't far away, the family and I decided that it would be a really good idea to take the time and go pay a visit. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, guys, this is gonna be a pretty cool experience. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I wonder what it's like, like, living in an orphanage. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ah, this could be it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello! Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Root? Hi. Kris. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe. Nice to meet you. Hi. Khloe. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; SAM: Sam. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Sam, what's up, bud? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; LEELA: Greetings. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hi. &gt;&gt; LEELA: Hello. My name is Leela. &gt;&gt; BRODY: My name is Brody. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. I'm Kendall. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: We wish you welcome finally. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: It is a great pleasure to welcome you. And hope you enjoy our coffee shop here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The coffee shop is beautiful. &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: So, they work here, they get to earn money here. They're learning here and they survive here together... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They all work here? &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: Yeah, altogether, yes. We have our property down there as well, and we... I wanted to show you that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, let's go see it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah! &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: Just follow me this way. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What's your name? Ali? &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: We have, uh, 14 girls, 11 boys. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: And also my staff as well. We have altogether six staff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. You're so cute. &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: This is, uh, our garden in the backyard. We have to plant some bean or some type of vegetable that we can eat right there around close to the river. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: Every evening, my children, they will swim right there, play in the water, make them... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's where they swim down there? &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Seeing this is like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, makes you kind of... appreciate it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Feel blessed. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And they've got smiles as big as can be, you know? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know. I know, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really impressed with how happy these kids are with, you know, so little of what they have. I grew up with a family that had such a strong family bond and connection that, you know, it just makes me so sad that these kids don't have that family element. You know how to play the guitar? You know how to play? Oh, him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you play us a song? &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: Are you ready? &gt;&gt; KIDS: Yeah! &gt;&gt; LEAH: ♫ I want to lay back Rest my head in the sand ♫ And hit the sheets in a simple song... ah. ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm very touched by this whole experience. I think that it's a crazy thing to have to see, and these kids have almost nothing and can still find reasons to be happy, and I think that my family can learn from them. &gt;&gt; LEAH: ♫ All of the Sunday Sunshine shine down on this ♫ Life of mine. Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh. ♫ &gt;&gt; ALL: ♫ Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh. ♫ &gt;&gt; LEAH: ♫ Oh, Sunday all the time. ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, we brought some gifts for you. If you guys want to come over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What'd you get? &gt;&gt; LEAH: You want to go play? Come on! Let's go, girls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aah! You tried to trick me. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's sticking! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Regulator! Here we go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That was good. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Nice! Nice! Point! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was fun to see everybody be interactive with one another and set their guards down and play and just everyone laugh and have fun. But I do wish my brother was here to see it, though. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, good job, buddy. We kicked their butts. Good job, good job! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall, if I ever pass, I will come back as a butterfly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, not Bruce on the Ping-Pong. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Did you hear me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, you're going to be a butterfly, Kylie. Abutterfly. That's what we're talking about now? &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you guys building? Oh, how cool! Do you like to build Legos? No? Only the girls? My nephew loves Legos. How old are you guys? &gt;&gt; GIRL: Nine years old. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're nine? &gt;&gt; GIRL 2: 11 years old. &gt;&gt; KIM: 11? And how old are you? &gt;&gt; GIRL 3: 12. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, wow. I like your bracelets. You guys want to do our handprint? I'm gonna do pink. You want to do it? What color? Yellow? Wipe it up. Go like this. Go like... Roll your hands up. Yay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where do I wash my hands? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, I like that color! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow! &gt;&gt; KIM: That's your name? Pink? Oh, wow, I love that name. Spending the day with these kids is so fulfilling, and there's this one girl, her name's Pink. And, you know, I totally gravitated towards her. Opportunities like this, I just really love and welcome. And I'm really glad that we're here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yay! Bye, everybody! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Bye, guys! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Nice meeting you guys. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Thank you so much. Thank you so much, guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye, you guys. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Bye, everybody! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Bye, guys! &gt;&gt; BRODY: We're leaving, like, right now. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, thank you so much! Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye! &gt;&gt; KIM: That is so sweet. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Good luck to you. I'll keep it forever, okay? &gt;&gt; GIRL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Aw... &gt;&gt; KIM: She gave me a bracelet. She came up to me and gave me her bracelet. &gt;&gt; BOY: Bye-bye! &gt;&gt; CHILDREN: Bye! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Amazing. &gt;&gt; LEAH: That one girl was really good at volleyball. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She was. She was so good. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She was just awesome. She's a really cool person. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She has a cool, like, soul, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are the maps? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's just crazy, 'cause, like, you don't get to choose how you grow up. Like, you don't get to choose where you live, what race you are, like... I mean, it just sucks, 'cause I feel like... I don't know, I just feel like they don't have, like, a mother figure. And it's like, I'm trying to think, like, where are they gonna go? Like, what are they gonna do after... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...they leave the orphanage? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: God, I feel so blessed right now. It's crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, that was so sweet. That little girl... no, seriously... &gt;&gt; BRODY: She was... yeah, that was really sweet. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like, they have nothing and she gave me her bracelet. I feel so bad. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, she... that's cool. She wanted to give you her bracelet. Now she knows that you have it, you know? That's cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: All the kids here are so sweet, but for some reason I have this, like, draw just to this particular girl named Pink. She ran up to me when I was leaving and gave me her bracelet for good luck. And it was just so sweet. She's so cute. I, like, literally want to take her home with me. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sorry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Thank you for getting dressed up for us. That's very sweet of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, you all, okay? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: After dinner, we're going to Thai boxing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You know, I would love to, if this was like an hour ago. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm there with you, Dad, we're going. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We've been out all day in the sun, I'm like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are girls doing it, too? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I understand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Or just boys are fighting? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Girls fight. &gt;&gt; BRODY: We're fighting over you, Khloe. That's what you don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is up with you and this obsession? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I-I don't know what the prize pool is tonight, but they could maybe use some extra... motivation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is disgusting. Small little Thai boy with me? Are you kidding? I could sit on them. So, Brody, take your idea somewhere else. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You know what we'll do is we'll lay some ground work for you, out there. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, exactly. They'll look at your photo real quick, so I can show... Let me see. Ooh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys. Enjoy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What have you been doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just in my room. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, she stole it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stressing the out of life. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Why? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, why not? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Have you been talking to Lamar much at all? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can't find him. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Really? Where-where is he? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He went back to New York, and then, ever since he's been there, he's been missing. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So... yeah. I'm pretty upset about it, but I don't know what else to do. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, you're an awesome person, Khloe, and you deserve a lot better than that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That's for sure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just need to make sure he's okay, though. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know why... but I need to. I thought I would shake him up if I said, "Okay. Divorce." He's like, "Okay." It just sucks. Oh, well. Lamar's... stuff will weigh on me for the rest of my life. I mean, the marriage didn't work out... not because of me, it wasn't what I wanted. So for the rest of my life, I'm gonna deal with that and worry about him and think about him and want just to protect him. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You know, people say, like, how could you do this to your family or your-your friends? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one knew, ever, until... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Nobody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, until he got so sloppy and started messing with all those girls and all those girls want to do is... their ten seconds of fame. Can't really talk about it. I'm gonna start crying. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. So, at the orphanage, this little girl, Pink... I would totally adopt her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't just fall in love with a child and then take them home like you're shopping. &gt;&gt; BRODY: My sister just broke up with her husband. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't believe Brandon and Brody are trying to find somebody in this place that they can hook up with Khloe. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You like this? &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, okay, yeah, yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. We're off to Thai boxing, guys. All by ourselves. We lost all the women. &gt;&gt; BRODY: So, like, is Kim having a wedding? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Where was my invite? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I don't know when the wedding is. I didn't get an invite, but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't worry, I haven't got an invite, either. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: This is a lot of work, going out scouting for Khloe. She owes us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Like they say it now, these Thai guys wouldn't know what hit 'em. If one of these guys said, "Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can I come?" What are you gonna do, Bro? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm gonna say, "Let's roll." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, that would go over big. Brandon and Brody are, you know, feeling pretty sorry for Khloe and what she's going through. I don't know if the answer to this is finding her a Thai boxer to get her mind off of it, but it is pretty funny and we'll see what happens here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What about you? I'm curious about you. What about, like... when are... are you gonna... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm done. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You're separated, right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I'm done. Done. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Done? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's called "strike three, you're out." &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, I believe it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRODY: This is, like, one of the first times I've ever pictured something and it's actually exactly how I pictured. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think either of these guys would be good for Khloe. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, me, either. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What about that guy up there? &gt;&gt; BRODY: You're not gonna come with us? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm not coming with you! ♫ ♫ Sometimes, my family can be a little crazy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey, I'm Brandon. How are you? Well, hey, we were... we came by here, we wanted to meet some people 'cause we were trying to look for somebody to maybe kind of hang out with our sister. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You like this? &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just can't believe Brandon and Brody are trying to find somebody in this place that they can hook up with Khloe. &gt;&gt; BRODY: My sister is in town, and she just broke up with her husband. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: That's your sister? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Would you... yeah. Would you... would you, yeah? &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, right? &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You should get a picture so that you can show Khloe. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yes, yes. Let's get a picture. Yeah. All right, thank you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Okay, have a good night. Thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That was rough, but we survived. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Ooh... ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What is with this carpet? &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't it insane? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. So what's going on today in the office? &gt;&gt; KIM: Going over stuff. This little girl, honestly, that I... that we saw at the orphanage, the one that gave me the bracelet. &gt;&gt; BRODY: She was cute, yeah. She was really cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: She was so sweet and cute. &gt;&gt; BRODY: She was. &gt;&gt; KIM: And it just, like, breaks my heart for these, like, kids that just live out here. It was, like, four girls... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...sleeping in a room with two beds. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: There were ants all over the floor. It was just... so sad. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's sad. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to know, like, what can you do? It's really hard seeing how little these children have. I mean, I'd love to give them the proper education and clothes... anything that I could think of, but especially, like, this little girl. You can't help but think, is there something more that I could do to change her life? I don't know, I'm just looking into it a little bit. That's how we're spending our afternoon while Miss North takes a nap. There's a crib downstairs, another crib in there. &gt;&gt; BRODY: She is so adorable. North is so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think you ever want kids one day? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm just waiting for Brandon and Leah, I mean... Uncle Brody. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think Burt is ever gonna have kids soon? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I don't know, actually. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, we've never discussed this. Did you see the video... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...of Burt going crazy on the paparazzi? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, some of those paparazzi guys are so... I mean, it's like... they say things to provoke you, and... Really hurtful, rude, mean... you know, and it's... I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye has to do, like, 50 hours of community service 'cause of one of those losers. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He-He's snapped on them a couple times, so we'll, we'll, like, not... &gt;&gt; KIM: He snapped on them, like... &gt;&gt; BRODY: There's one at the airport, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: One at the airport years ago. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That was by himself. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was with, like, his best friend and that was years ago and he just took the camera and threw it. Kanye went to jail, they arrested him. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, that's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: And you know you get to make one call in jail? So, he called Mr. Chow's and ordered take-out to jail. Just, like... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He ordered Mr. Chow's? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That's funny. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Will you tell me a little bit about why we don't have Rob here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. He's, he wants to be a little bit private and try to get through this. I, you know, over the course of a year, he's gained 75 pounds. It's, like, devastating. I think he needs to hang around positive influences. And it's got to start where he feels safe. So, you know, I'm kind of struggling with two issues. One is obviously Rob and getting him back to a really healthy place, but the other part is Khloe feels so responsible. For Rob. Because she feels, like, maybe, you know, Rob was living with her and Lamar and they were going through a bad time. Lamar was going through a bad time and maybe that rubbed off on Rob. So she feels like now she has to fix it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's a testament to her because she's such a strong person and, you know, she's just been going through so much, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: ...it's important for her to be able to play the card, so to speak, every once in a while. Just be like, I need to take care of myself, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, she's not gonna do anybody else any good unless she really heals herself and goes back to being strong Khloe. The way that I know she's happiest. She's going through all those emotions and trying to flush that out and find herself again. It's a sad thing to watch your daughter go through. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: She'll be good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, she'll be okay. She's a strong girl and she'll come out the other side. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Stronger. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Man, you're, like, wearing all black. in all black. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: We're all in all black. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, are you literally reading that again? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. I know, I can't stop, I'm so proud of you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Aw... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey, look at that. You carry it around everywhere? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's my Bible. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's a big deal. &gt;&gt; KIM: Usually I say, she's embarrassing and I'm like, "Uh, Mom, please don't," but that's not embarrassing for her to carry around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I'm proud of my kid. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Mom's always embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, so, at the orphanage, this little girl Pink... her real name is... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I saw Pink... I saw handprints on the wall. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, and then it said "Pink." &gt;&gt; BRANDON: And I thought either Pink had visited or there was a girl, a little girl named Pink. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. No, her name is Pink, and I... literally cannot stop thinking about her. I told Kanye, I was like, honestly, like, this girl is so sweet and so cute, like, I would totally adopt her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. That's a little aggressive. I think that you can't just... go to an orphanage and fall in love with a child and then take them home like you're shopping. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You get very passionate about things, and then... you don't think about... the whole thing through. You know? I mean, I bet there are other things that you could do that would make all the difference in this little girl's life that you could do without bringing her home. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know my mom and Brandon aren't really getting this idea. In the past, I never would've thought of adoption. But when you meet someone that you really connect to like this, you can't help but think, like, how can you change their life. And I think that... looking into adoption, it would be amazing. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hello? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I have your, uh, future wife right here. &gt;&gt; MAN: What's your name? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe. Maybe we can meet up and have a coffee. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I have a date. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Congratulations! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Let's go on the boat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Jesus, you guys! &gt;&gt; LEAH: It's just a little swim-- what's your problem? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't trust you right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You talking to me? &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, so you're chilling solo? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to take a selfie with me? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Selfie? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You can do it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What's the deal with the weeding? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's at the end of May. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: You, Brandon and Leah are invited. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Where's it gonna be? &gt;&gt; KIM: Paris. I got to tell Brandon and Leah, too. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, hey, guys! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's so nice out here, isn't it? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi! &gt;&gt; KIM: I was just giving Brody my, um, wedding info. We haven't set our invites yet, but I want to tell people, like, close to me the dates. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Is it gonna be big or small? &gt;&gt; KIM: Really small. He wanted to get married in the Louvre, in the museum. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, whoa! Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but there's, like, certain music restrictions and certain things, so this chateau, we're gonna cover it with, like, lots of flowers and all the things that really look new to have, have that, like, effect. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, well... &gt;&gt; LEAH: Ah, I'm excited for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it'll be fun. Like, a fun few days. &gt;&gt; LEAH: God, it's so beautiful here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, right? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Let's go on the boat! You want to go on the boat with me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not gonna tip over? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Come on, I swear it won't tip over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ken, will you go on the boat? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'll go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Jesus, you guys! &gt;&gt; LEAH: Okay, we go out there, and jump off, take a little swim, just a little swim. What's your problem? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't trust you right now. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I promise... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can swim now. Off the boat. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What a jump. That was good. &gt;&gt; KIM: You did good! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Not quite as good as the, uh, Thai boxing, though. &gt;&gt; KIM: You look amazing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: She's... I know. Khloe? &gt;&gt; KIM: You look amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My first time... &gt;&gt; BRODY: She does look good. She looks incredible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...on that thing. I hate the ocean. And I almost died. But it's okay, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: You want to show him? Watch-- clap hands! Clap hands. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Can you clap? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Huh? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We went to Thai boxing last night. &gt;&gt; BRODY: We found Khloe's future husband. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's awesome. &gt;&gt; BRODY: These guys barely speak English and going, "Yeah, this!" Well, you like her? You like? And they're like, "Yeah, yeah, okay," and I'm like, "Yeah, okay, we'll set you up." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did they have a cell phone? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I gave the guy, well, this one guy, we should try calling him right now just to see if he picks up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my gosh. Does he speak English? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you show him to Khloe yet? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Shh. It's ringing. It's ringing. It's ringing. It's ringing. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hello? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yo! What's up, buddy? I have, I have your, uh, future wife right here. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yes? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, say hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, how are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. How are you? I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; MAN: What's your name? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe. Do you like the name Khloe? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What language do you speak? &gt;&gt; MAN: French and a little Spanish. &gt;&gt; BRODY: A little Spanish. ¿cómo está? muy bien. ¿Y tú? muy bien. I'd love to go out with you one day. Maybe we can meet up and have a coffee. ¿Tú... tú le gusta café? &gt;&gt; MAN: I like what? café. &gt;&gt; MAN: Coffee, yeah, yeah. I like coffee. Muy bien. I'll call you later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I have a date. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Congratulations! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRODY: You got Khloe a date. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got, I got a date. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; MARK: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; MARK: Good, very... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; MARK: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mwah, mwah. This room is fantastic. &gt;&gt; MARK: How's everything? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Good. &gt;&gt; MARK: Everything going okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, really good. &gt;&gt; MARK: Fantastic. You look very comfortable in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Very comfortable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. We love it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Every room is just so different and so cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: First of all, it was such a great experience for us to go to the orphanage the other day. I really, um, it was an eye-opener for sure. And Kim, I think, has this attachment for a little girl named Pink. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's so sweet. So, in a place like that... are those kids, like, up for adoption? &gt;&gt; MARK: No, I don't think you can adopt here in Thailand. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have been so stressed-out lately. Now is the time where you really need to take care of yourself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been trying to avoid Kim all day, but she was trying to corner me. It's pissing me off. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are those kids, like, up for adoption? &gt;&gt; MARK: No, I don't think you can adopt here in Thailand. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; MARK: I mean, to actually adopt the kids from Thailand is very, very difficult. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; MARK: Well, the government, they're worried that people are gonna come here and take the children for their own reasons. You have to speak to the guy who runs it about what he needs, how you can help. What's the best way to give? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just so sad to know that because so many people were taking advantage, it has ruined the chances of other children getting experiences that can change their world. What more can I do? &gt;&gt; MARK: We're now actually helping them with, come up with a plan to rebuild the place. So, we're going to do... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's great! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, 'cause we were asking, like, what do they...? 'Cause if they don't have, like, air conditioning and electricity and stuff? &gt;&gt; MARK: Yeah, we're-we're doing a plan right now to help them redevelop it, to rebuild the place up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, that makes me feel better about Pink that those needs are being addressed. So, when we go over there, we'll check it out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, Mark, thank you. &gt;&gt; MARK: All right. See you later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. Thank you. So, I think we have to talk to the guy that we met the other day who runs the orphanage. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then we'll find out what it is that we can do, what he thinks that the kids would really benefit from. In the meantime, we'll go over. We'll bring them some shirts and stuff and a swimming pool. &gt;&gt; KIM: A pool? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So that they can have something to... at least splash off in. How's that? &gt;&gt; KIM: I love that. Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mean it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I really don't know much about Buddhism. Do you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just know it's a very peaceful religion. I don't know much. I need to be more knowledgeable. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, on stuff like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We are going to a Buddhist temple, and who knows? Maybe going to a Buddhist temple will give me peace and serenity. And I can enjoy the rest of this trip. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ah, look at Buddha. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wow! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's huge. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's amazing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God, it's huge! &gt;&gt; BRODY: That is amazing. I'm a little worried, though-- I'm serious-- about making... I don't want to break any rules. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No hats first. That's a start. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I just took mine off. I would leave it here. &gt;&gt; POM POM: Thank you for coming. And these are the offerings for the gentlemen to take inside with me so we can offer to the monks. Please remove your shoes before enter the temple. And I'll walk you through slowly. You are entering a sacred place. Nothing bad can enter at this point. So, please follow me inside. The gentlemen sit this row, facing the monks, please. And the ladies a little bit behind, yes. Thank you. And now, uh, he's gonna give us all blessing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This Thailand trip has been very emotionally draining. So, I think just to be at a Buddhist temple where you can't talk and you're just in your own thoughts and it's like serenity and peacefulness-- it's a good vibe to be in right now. &gt;&gt; POM POM: So, um, if you'd like to meditate a little bit, you can. I would like to show you outside of the temple. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, please. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where's Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love that we have the opportunity to do this kind of stuff. It kind of makes you refocus everything and realize, like, why is everyone fighting? Why does everyone make everything so negative? &gt;&gt; KIM: Was this, like, peaceful for you? Did you find it, like, relaxing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do. I like this kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like you need to relax, like, more often and just, like, not stress out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think it's realistic to say don't stress. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just feel like you have been feeling like you have to take full responsibility for Rob when now is the time where you really need to take care of yourself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been trying to avoid Kim all day. And now that we're at this Buddhist temple, I'm supposed to have some, like, peace and quiet, but she is trying to corner me and it's pissing me off. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Brody, that guy just touched my ass. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You justtouch my sister? &gt;&gt; MAN: No. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you kidding me, bro? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you guys come with me, we're gonna take a little walk out to the beach, and we're gonna do something really, really special tonight. You guys are gonna remember this forever. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just feel like you have been so stressed-out lately, feeling like you have to take full responsibility for Rob when now is the time where you really need to take care of yourself. You know, I think it's just, like, we put this pressure on you, like, okay, Khloe is now moving out, you know, Rob can live with her, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't mind, though. I... &gt;&gt; KIM: No one even asked. We just are like, "Khloe's gonna fix him." But it's a lot of responsibility. I could just see that it's changed you a little bit or you just have this, like, heavy heart, but I think that you should start being selfish even though he needs help. I feel like you should just try to really, like, help yourself and just live life and re... you know, recover from everything that you've gone through. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I definitely feel guilty, but Kim is right. There's only so much I can do for Rob. Yeah. Old habits die hard. &gt;&gt; KIM: I get it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People have to want to help themselves. And without them wanting to help themselves, there's nothing any of us can do. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just feel bad if we have put any pressure on you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I appreciate it, Keeks. Have you ever held my hand before? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I'm not, like, a hand holder. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: The germs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Then I'll let go. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I'm not letting go. I am not letting go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys! How are you? We brought you some presents. Even though I'm not gonna adopt, I still want to do something for this orphanage, and just donate stuff for them to help with whatever needs that they have for all the kids. &gt;&gt; KIDS: Thank you! &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: Thank you so much, thank you so much. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. So, we found a swimming pool. Do you guys have a place where you could put it? &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So the kids can splash around? &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: Yeah, we have a big site. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, good. So, yes, of course. You're doing such a good job. &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's an amazing, amazing thing you guys do here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can we go in and see the handprints in the media room? &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can we go? Okay. So cute! That's me. That's Pink. I have something else for you for giving me the bracelet. &gt;&gt; PINK: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're welcome. I know I'm not gonna be seeing Pink every day. I wanted to just go and say bye one last time. I'll always remember her. Well, thank you so much for having us back here. &gt;&gt; PAPANGKORN: Thank you for that, thank you for... &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. Okay, bye, guys! &gt;&gt; KIDS: Bye! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll see you guys soon! Bye! &gt;&gt; KIDS: Bye! Thank you! Bye! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye! &gt;&gt; KIDS: Bye! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Someone's having a party down there? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you hear it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Should we go to it? : Should we go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They have a tent. Oh, thisis getting real. Oh, this is so cute. Stop. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Aw, honeymoon stage. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're posing. Is this a wedding? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We were so confident... Oh, is it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's the bride! It is a wedding! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Congratulations. Looks beauti... Your dress is beautiful. &gt;&gt; GROOM: Take a photo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure! Yeah! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah! Let's do it. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: One more time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is how I want a vacation to be. We're in, like, this beautiful, tranquil beach. It's, like, so pretty. We end up being wedding crashers, but at least we're ending on a high note. You guys should've come! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We went to a wedding! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall had the best time of her life. Cheers to Thailand. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Cheers, guys. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Cheers to a good trip. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Cheers. Oh, that's actually really good. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You missed me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Cheers. I guess our, uh, mission to find you a little vacation romance is, uh... hasn't been too successful. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Failed? &gt;&gt; BRODY: You know we called that guy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The fact that you guys are showing my photo around, I could kill you both. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I was thinking more of, like, a one-night stand, not, like, a relationship. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but I don't do one-night stands. I don't want a relationship, but I don't... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why not? That's what I'm saying, rela... Like, just one of these Thai boxers to just tee off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. As amused as I am that my brothers want to help me find a vacation fling, it's just not my steez. Sorry, boys. I mean, I appreciate you guys wanting me to have a good time and, like, have, like, single Khloe, but I'm... just not mentally there. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Not into it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way! &gt;&gt; BRODY: You guys want wine or something? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure, thanks, Brode. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do you want me to help you? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Help me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna need some help. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do you want me to help you? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Can I please have, uh, one more, uh, wine, two more beers, please. Yes, thank you very much. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Excuse me! Brody, that guy just touched my ass. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That guy just grabbed my ass. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Who? You justtouch my sister? &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh. That your sister? No. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you kidding me, bro? &gt;&gt; MAN: What? No. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You justtouch my sister? &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh. No. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Are you kidding me, bro? &gt;&gt; MAN: What? No. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, man! &gt;&gt; BRODY: &gt;&gt; BOUNCER: Hey, hey, hey. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, hey, hey! &gt;&gt; BRODY:out of control. What thewas this guy thinking? that guy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Let him go. It's good that you did that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go, Brody, go! Stand up for your sister! Even though, like, Brody kind of gets a little too in the nitty-gritty of, like, my personal life, I know it comes from a good place, like, I know at the end of the day, he'll always be there to love and protect us. He's protecting Kendall right now-- that's what big brothers are for. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What a creeper, bro. You got... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Loyalty, family. Go, Brody! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Woosah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everyone, let's go down to the beach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We get it, Mother! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Son of a bitch! Little piece of! Look at this, you guys. &gt;&gt; BRODY: How am I, like, sweating again? I'm, like, so hot all the time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so amazing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay, this is amazing, you guys. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Chicken? &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's chicken. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And how do they get their fingers way back like that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Right? It's crazy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Look at this. This is as far as I can go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dude, Khloe got it. Khloe's good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe's a natural. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at this guy behind you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is the courtship. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He got her. He's going to tee off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Tee off"-- that's what you said when you were in New York? &gt;&gt; BRODY: You like "tee off." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, you guys, I would like to make a toast. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Toast, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'd like to make a toast to my family and everything that we've been through, but that what leads us here today, and if you guys come with me, we're gonna take a little walk out to the beach, and we're gonna do something really, really special tonight. And the significance of what we're gonna do is about letting go. I've organized a surprise tonight for something that I think the family will all really benefit from, especially right now. You guys are gonna remember this forever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're gonna do something really, really special tonight. You guys are gonna remember this forever. So, think about what you want to let go. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Wow, this is so cool. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everyone gets one. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Ah, that's so cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow, I love this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so significant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, yeah! Ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Each and every one of us has something that we need to let go of. So, I've set up this really amazing lantern releasing ceremony. It's where you take a lantern and you imagine something in it that you want to let go of. And then you release it out into the sky. Really think about what you want to let go of. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, you don't have to say it out loud. Then it won't come true. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you ready? Getting ready to launch. Here's Kim's. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's so cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, it's really cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, there goes Kim's! &gt;&gt; KIM: That's so cool! Letting go lanterns. I just hope that everyone in the family lets go of something that's just weighing heavy on their heart. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let it go! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I guess I'm kind of just letting go of my young self and the past and just becoming independent and moving out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, you're getting rid of a lot! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: These lanterns are really cool. And hopefully everyone's getting rid of their negative energy. I know I did. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's ready to go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah! Way to go! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yours got a good gust in it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, look how far ours are! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it's so pretty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There it goes! Say good-bye to my lousy putter! It's great to let go of a lot of things and let them just float off into the sky. Everybody seemed to work out everything in the end. It was great having Brandon and Brody and Leah together. So, overall I think the Thai vacation was a great success. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Brandon's is just like, like, all peaceful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There they go. All of our troubles-- wave, say good-bye. And good-bye to Thailand. All right, Leah! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yours went up fastest-- whoa! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think what I'm letting go of is fear. Fear of everything not being exactly the way it was. And there's no reason to fear change. And I think change is good for all of us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie! Even though I was really resistant to come on this vacation, I did have a great time, and I can't put the responsibility on myself for trying to fix everybody's problems. Bye, bad Sometimes I just have to let go and let God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at our lights up there, guys! That's all our crap, by the way. You okay, Mom? Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because of the way you've been feeling, what if you got some medical marijuana? &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not condoning that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. I am her interior designer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is cool. Should I take a picture for you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. What is this? Wait, what service fee? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You think I'm doing this for free? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take a girl to dinner before you justher up the ass! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We are staying at the Versace mansion. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Versace! Versace! Versace! Versace! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is starting to get a little sloppy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just pissed and dripped a little pee pee in my pants.
