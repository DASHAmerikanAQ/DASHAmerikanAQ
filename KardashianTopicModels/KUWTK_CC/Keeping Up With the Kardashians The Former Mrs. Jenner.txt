- &gt;&gt; KIM: I think you'll love this class. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, 'cause it's like an easy workout, but you feel it, so it's not like annoying, you know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi, girls. Welcome, welcome. Come on in. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is my sister Kourtney. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I know. Nice to meet you, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Do you have any injuries, anything that bugs you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This right here-- this means mom ass. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Right. Anti-gravity exercises, huh? Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I haven't worked out in like two years. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You're going to feel this tomorrow, girl. You feel how your abs work and your glutes? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And my vagina. &gt;&gt; WOMAN:And your vagina. Nice... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Holy.. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Work that ass. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, my ass is literally going to be like Kim's. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It's growing as we speak. Good, you guys. finish strong with these and we'll do a cool down. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like I'm having sex. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Four, three, two and one. 28 00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:02,195 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, I think I just broke my ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: So how do you keep your sanity with all these busy careers of your daughters and yourself? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't. Hi. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Kris Kardashian here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? Oh, Jenner. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: I'm sorry. Jenner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, it's okay. It happens all the time. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Does it really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm getting used to it. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: I apologize. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's okay. I was a Kardashian before they were a Kardashian. People, because my kids' last name is Kardashian, mix us up all the time. So it's not unusual. I'm developing their brand. I'm making new Kardashian products. My life all day long is pretty much a Kardashian world. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Do you feel like you've lost your identity of your last name? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everything we do is sort of Kardashian oriented. So everybody makes the same mistake. But it does give me a better restaurant reservation. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Oh, so you use the Kardashian... You don't say Kris Jenner, you say Kris Kardashian? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, I roll with it. I, like, pull out all the stops. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I kinda want to go to boot camp again. Is that crazy? Wait, are you at Khloe's yet? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I'm here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so annoyed. There's something, like, online-- it says "Kim's butt deflated." Like, her butt implants. I have no idea. It's so ridiculous. People ask me all the time if my butt is real. Like, some Web sites say I have, like, butt implants, and then some say I have, like, butt pads. This has been going on for years, and it is so ridiculous. Everyone has a butt. Like, some are bigger, some are smaller. Like, I don't-- I just-- I don't understand. Will you look at a computer at Khloe's and tell me what, if you-- what you see? Will you, like, Google it or something? Yeah, I'm almost there. 69 00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,822 Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, bye. Okay, when you type in "Kim butt implants," the first thing that comes up is "Brazilian butt lift-- get the butt of your dreams." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have a question. This rock is good luck, but do we throw it away? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why would you throw it away? Let me see. I like that. Kim, I want you to know-- I Googled "Kim's ass," and it says, "Tragedy struck Kim Kardashian last night. On a private plane from New Jersey to Las Vegas, her left butt cheek exploded." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They can make up a completely fake story, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the same Web site that says that Kim burned a raccoon. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't even take this seriously. I've said numerous times, like, I haven't had plastic surgery, I haven't had butt implants. I mean people just want to write whatever they want to write. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, "Butt implants, before and after plastic surgery." &gt;&gt; KIM: Nice. Oh, my God, let's see this. What's so funny is this picture was after this picture. First of all, who the hell of a normal person gets butt implants? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, if you want to prove them wrong, get, like, an X-ray, and like... &gt;&gt; KIM: An X-ray? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of your ass to show there's no siliconein there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that's an amazing idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: Honestly, like, you're so annoying. If anyone should understand, it's, like, you guys. Like, why do you, why are you...? Stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's do a little squish test. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, feel that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what silicone feels like. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! Yeah, baby. I like Kim's jiggly butt. I feel like this is like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow. I just, I... Like, if I were to get... If I were to literally have a fake ass, wouldn't it be like, dimple free? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think you can control cellulite. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I definitely think it's a stupid idea to get an X-ray, but it would definitely stop the rumors. It would also be a lot of fun for me to see Kim going to ask the doctor for a butt X-ray. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm starving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I bet your booty is, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you ever put food up your ass? A hot dog? &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, you guys... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, a hot dog. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's go eat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I bet your ass will suck the hot dog so fast. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop! That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A Twizzler. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A pickle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A pickle would be good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Pickled ass? 120 00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,351 &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's try it. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's like this ridiculous Web site that said my butt exploded, like, on a plane. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The girls and I have been going on these walks together because it's a great way to catch up, and get some exercise. It's really great. Especially since we're all so crazy busy. Wait, did your butt really explode? It's still there. What do you guys think? I've been kind of thinking about just maybe for real changing my last name back to Kardashian. What's really crazy is that everybody mistakes me for being a Kardashian and just professionally, it might be a really good idea just to call myself Kris Kardashian from now on. &gt;&gt; KIM: You had that title for about 12 years, and you gave it up. I think it is so disrespectful and so rude, and I can't believe that would even be a thought that would come to her brain. &gt;&gt; KRIS: At this point, it's just like a branding thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Would you want...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not like for real, it's just, like, Kardashian-- we're all Kardashians. They even think Bruce is Bruce Kardashian. How pathetic is that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No one thinks that. &gt;&gt; KIM: No one thinks that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's with me all the time, and people go, "Oh, hi. It's Kris Kardashian," or "Hi, Mrs. Kardashian." And he doesn't even say a word. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've heard him. Like, he'll-- someone, you'll say, "Hi, this is Kris Kardashian. I'm calling on the behalf of my daughters," or something like that. And I'll look at him, and he'll just like roll his eyes. &gt;&gt; KIM: She says that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: She says that? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes, she says, "Hi, this is Kris Kardashian," I'm not even kidding. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is so embarrassing. Like, what a sellout. Like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: A sellout? It's like, it's like a brand. It's like the Kennedys. Everybody knows the Kennedys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think that Maria Shriver thinks, "Should I change 159 00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,560 my name to Maria Kennedy?" Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo, I have your salad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Coming, my jungle friend. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh. Are you doing a photo shoot? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I already did it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're just wearing that for fun? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just wearing it for fun. Do you want to sit at the table? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I wonder if we took a survey, how many people really think Kim's ass is fake or real? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think her ass is fake? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Do you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sometimes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It used to be, like, she had a big ass, like... like mine, but now it's like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When would she? Like, wouldn't we know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. So many times she's been on vacation for weeks and stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you have pictures? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have photo albums in there. Oh, here's some pics of Kim. This is after ass. See? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love that dress. There are not enough ass pictures in this photo album. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's because Kimberly stole them all. Bible, she came to all of our house and stole them all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can't "Bible" that, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, I can. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you can't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's call Kim and make her do this. Joge. X-ray! X-ray! X-ray! Show us the ass. Show us the ass. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We want to see the goods, Kimberly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need some proof. &gt;&gt; KIM: Take an X-ray? What would I do, say, "Sorry, my hurts. Will you please take an X-ray?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, maybe you cracked yourand you need to see if it's broken. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe's obviously joking. She knows Kim's butt is real, but it is so fun to mess with her. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, ridiculous, so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's ridonculous is that if you don't do this, Kourtney and I are going to Twitter-blast your ass. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I mean, you guys are just, like, being ridiculous. You're my sisters. You should know that. So if an X-ray is what it takes, done-- sign me up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo-hoo! Butt X-rays! Henry, are you excited? Are you excited? Henry's here. Hen-Hen... Hen... Can we bring Henry? Kourtney! 207 00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,922 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. I'm going to fall, Khloe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I'm just recording a new message. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, Kendall had some interesting news for me today. Are you changing your last name back to Kardashian? Hang up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't... I... Well, I mean, first of all, everybody already thinks I'm Kris Kardashian. Everyone calls me Kris Kardashian, Mrs. Kardashian, all day long. And I think people get kind of confused when they call here... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do they? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and they want a Kardashian, that they're getting Jenner Communications. They're like, "What?" So I just think it might be a good idea to change my name to Kardashian. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A long time ago, when I won the Games, the Jenner name was known all over the world. Every country I went to, they knew who I was. And now, all of a sudden, she wants to go back because the girls' name is big all around the world? She's nuts! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tina Turner was married to some abusive freak forever, but she kept her name. Get it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just about the brand. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, Mrs. 232 00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:31,364 Kardashian. Great. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How you are acting, saying you want to change your name to Kardashian... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...that's hurtful. &gt;&gt; MAN: You ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, honey. me running. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That was kind of bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am meeting up with Bruce because Bruce wants to teach me some golf form. Because now that the off-season is coming up, Bruce truly thinks this is what Lamar's going to be doing is playing golf, so I get to learn, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, you got Lamar, and he says he wants to play golf. You got to learn how to play it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He could play with you-- you need a friend. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, he can play with you-- you need to be out there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You need a friend. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you hear the rumor Mom's trying to change her name to Kardashian back from Jenner? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not funny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, that's what I said to her-- it's not funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you being serious or you're kidding? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm being serious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is she being serious, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, she goes, "Oh, the name's so big now, maybe I should just go back to it." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's such a little fame whore, I can't even deal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She goes, "Everybody calls me that name anyway." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The fact, though, that you aren't causing more of, like, a fit about this-- do you really not care? Or do you not care to have the argument? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't care to have the argument. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To be honest with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But do you care that her last name would be Kardashian? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I just think it's stupid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why can't you stand up to her? What are you so afraid of? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It just rocks the cradle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Even if Bruce doesn't say anything, I feel bad that my mom is, like, emascul... like, you're taking that away from him. It's just, I think, disgusting. Okay. Yay! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's a start. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You hit it really far. You're actually good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know what I'm doing. I've been working on it for about ten years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I could maybe hit it better if they were black balls. Ha, ha, ha. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I was going to give you a kiss. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? Kris Kardashian? Or... I don't know. What is your name now? Mom, you really have some nerve. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Kris Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can call me Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just think my mom has completely lost it. I think she has no idea where reality is at this point. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just all about the brand. And I made little Kardashians, so I have something to do with the Kardashian brand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All I heard you say is "brand, brand, brand." I'm going to try to be calm and talk to you nicely. How you are acting right now, like, saying you want to change your name to Kardashian... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...that's hurtful. Jenner was good enough for the first 20 years, and now, all of a sudden, you want to change it to Kardashian? Like, that's not okay for Bruce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not because I don't think that Jenner's, uh, good enough or it's not... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't be a groupie. You can't be Bruce Jenner's , and now you want to be the Kardashian Sorry. You can't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, you're making me feel actually really bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, how do you think he feels? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I don't... I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause you don't care. I want you to just look in this office alone. Is there one image of Bruce? I see my dad. I see my biological father in here. Before you had us, you had 306 00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:55,935 Bruce's gold medal and jersey and this plastered everywhere. Now where... where is his gold medal and jersey and... where is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're seriously making me feel bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You should. This is real. 312 00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,250 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel, like, really bad right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I just show you one more thing? Come. Come, come. She's so caught up in work and so lost sight of what's important and... Sorry, what's important is your husband of 20 years, not the brand that we have right now. This is your family portrait wall. Now, you don't have the person who lives in this house, who 321 00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,478 helps provide for this home. Like, come on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, I'm happy that I had you to point this out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, sorry. Take this away. We get it. Bye. 326 00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:54,227 Abominable snowman, bye-bye. Like, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That outfit you have on... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to the gym. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...is so sensual. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, today I am gonna get a butt X-ray, and if this is what it takes to shut up the entire world-- that my butt is real-- then I will happily do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you ever thought about zebras with no stripes? Are they really zebras, or are they therefore horses? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, they're still a zebra. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A zebra with no stripes is still a zebra. So what makes a horse a horse? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Zebras live in a land of the rainbow-colored trees. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Dr. Vaisman will see you guys now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; ALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why is there some lubricant jelly on the thing and some rubber gloves? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Getting ready for business. You ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take your pants off. Scalpel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Hey, girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Good. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: So what brings you in today? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a really crazy request. My sisters have dared me to get a butt X-ray because there are so many rumors that I have butt implants... &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and I'm so tired of them, so I really just want to get, like, a butt X-ray so I can show the whole world. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Or just, like, feel her ass up and see if it's-- like, you'll know, you're a doctor-- to see if it's real. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can we X-ray Kourtney's boobs so I can see what an implant looks like? &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Since I have breast implants, we are going to X-ray me so we can see what an implant looks like, and then we're gonna X-ray Kim's butt and see if she really has implants or not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look cute. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Okay. You all set? You ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ready as I'll ever be. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're ready for the truth. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: I'm gonna have you girls step behind the wall. All right, so I want you to take a deep breath in and out and hold it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Okay? Whenever you're ready. All right, here we go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What was that for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was a bird. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: It was a bird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Isn't it fun being in close quarters with each other? Whoo! Shake your! The fact that Kim was actually laying on a table and actually getting an X-ray of her ass is, like, this is iconic. Like, are you serious? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How did it feel? &gt;&gt; KIM: I did it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo! Shake, rattle and roll. &gt;&gt; KIM: I did it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's see it. Is it immediate? &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Takes a few minutes to, uh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...process? &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Yeah, to process, but we'll be able to look in a few minutes. Got the results. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: You ready for Kim's? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. I see a cheeseburger! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! Your spine! Ew! Kourtney and I have an announcement: we went to the 390 00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:49,201 doctor's... &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: Girls, ready to see the big reveal? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we're ready. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: So, Kourtney first. Those are your lungs over here. And this sort of solid white area? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: ...that's your implant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah... &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: You ready for Kim's? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dah-dah dun... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's a cheeseburger. I see a cheeseburger! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that your spine? Ew! Your spine! Ew! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I see an Oreo. &gt;&gt; KIM: That freaks me out. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: No implant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shocker. &gt;&gt; VAISMAN: This is all Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so glad that I did this X-ray just for the fact that my sisters annoyed me and were picking on me just to get at me. And the whole world doubting me. This X-ray is, like, the best thing I ever could have done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, do you want to stand by yours? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Photo op. One, two, three. 413 00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:48,527 Good. We know who's real. Uh! Whoo! Yeah! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Scott, hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Me and my family were all getting together for dinner. But before this family dinner, I have a little treat for everybody. Kourtney and I have an announcement: we went to the doctor's. This is Kourtney's breast implant. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you showing us those? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why are we showing breast implants? &gt;&gt; KIM: Now this is my butt. I did an X-ray on my butt... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To show... &gt;&gt; KIM: ...to show the world that I do not have an implant. Do you see? It is full fat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Bruce, what do you say next week me and you get X-rays of our balls and put 'em on our blog? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, yeah, I'll go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just don't want to be questioned anymore about my balls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, me neither. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When the time is right, I'm gonna be posting these on something called khloek.com. I just need the Kim K. approval. My plan is to post these little booty shots to showcase Kimberly's X-rayed ass images. That it's real, and this is, like, the declaration: Kim's ass is real! Look at it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here goes. The proof is in the X-ray. Kim's ass is 100% real. She's all natural, baby. Once and for all, the world... &gt;&gt; KIM: They will know-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...the world's gonna know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get over here... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...what you already know. Ow! Ow... Maybe now, like, everyone will see that my butt is real. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, shake that ass, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would just like to make a toast to Bruce. Honey, I feel sort of ridiculous because I've spent the last couple of weeks trying to decide if I wanted to change my name back to Kardashian or not. And I just wanted to tell you that I love you very much and I have a surprise for you. Bruce and I have spent the last 20 years together, and I think we have made and built the most amazing family. We've nurtured these kids from the time they were really little, and we've had Kendall and Kylie to add to the whole clan. And I am so proud and happy to be his wife and to be Kris Jenner. This is something... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, that is so sweet! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I make the wall? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, Scott.
