- &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. You look cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just online shopping. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, what is this dumb thing that we're doing? BG what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: BG5. It's five girls who used to be called the Beach Girls Five, but they got a little bit older and so now they call themselves the BG5. They're going to have a music video that they're doing, so we're going to go over there soon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's we? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're going to go with me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I want to see what you think. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you feeling the need to manage other people? &gt;&gt; KRIS: My friend Kenneth Crear who I've known since he was Janet Jackson's manager, asked me to help him co-manage a new band that he's discovered called the BG5. &gt;&gt; KENNETH: Your business mind and savvy and just having that knack with the females. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My ex-husband Robert Kardashian was in the music business, and it was always my intention to get involved in the business with him, but once we started having kids, I decided to dedicate myself solely to the family. As much as I enjoy being a "momager," I think it would be really amazing to have an identity outside of my own family. I really think I could take these girls to the next level. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you're our manager, not theirs, so don't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you jealous, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. But you're not supposed to be anyone else's manager, Especially someone named R2-D2. &gt;&gt; KRIS: BG5. And they're really cute, and I really love these girls. 34 00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,820 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you love anyone who gives you ten percent. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why theare we here? Stop. They're my... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not, like, a beach girl. What is this? Kris talked me into coming to the pier with her so she could oversee BG5's music video shoot. This is like death on a stick. This is really not what I had in mind for a night out. Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is Khloe. &gt;&gt; KENNETH: Kenneth Crear. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KENNETH: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is who's managing the BG5. &gt;&gt; KENNETH: The girls should be here somewhere. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There they are. &gt;&gt; KENNETH: Here they come. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, girls! You guys look great. &gt;&gt; BG5: Hi! &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm Khloe. Nice to meet you. Is this your first video? &gt;&gt; BG5: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: As a group? &gt;&gt; BG5: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that's so cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you guys know what you're doing? &gt;&gt; BG5: No. &gt;&gt; BG5: Not really. &gt;&gt; We know we're frolicking in the water. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Picture's up. &gt;&gt; ALL: Go! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: So we don't have to pay any of the extras? &gt;&gt; KENNETH: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love this. We have to get the style for them going. Every one of their personalities needs to come out and shine. &gt;&gt; KENNETH: This can be your new daughters, your new handful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, right? Reminds me of when my girls were just kind of getting started with what they're doing. Suck it up, girls! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why theare we here? Kris told me we were going to the Santa Monica Pier. I never would have gotten this dolled up to go to the freakin' sandy beach. Is this a joke? There's nochairs up here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need to stand on some hard ground. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, most people don't wear six-inch Louboutins to the beach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought there was going to be a carnival, like the Santa Monica Pier. I thought I was going to get cotton candy and win games. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, if you come down and be a good girl, I'll buy you a hot dog. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If I ruin my shoes, Mom, are you going to buy me a new pair? Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a little busy, Khloe. I'm working. Yay, girls! &gt;&gt; BG5: You want a hug? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was... Uh, no. No more hugging. &gt;&gt; BG5: Are you sure? Are you sure? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, but I'm proud of you guys. You did a great job. You could have waited for me, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Open the door. Khloe, come on. Khloe, Khloe. Khloe. I totally just wet my pants. I just wet my pants. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, do you need diapers now? This is disgusting. You and Mason shop at the same stores. Okay, you got to wear a pair of diapers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'll wear a diaper. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And walk around the house, and I'm timing you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Say you promise. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Promise. Okay, good. I'll wear the diaper. Let me in the car. &gt;&gt;

- &gt;&gt; I already planned it. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, all right, all right. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Now, now, don't fight, girls. &gt;&gt; ROB: Malika can sit here. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Open up the chair for Malika, I see ya. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look nice, Rob. I like your hair longer. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I do, too. I told you that yesterday, didn't I? &gt;&gt; ROB: I might shave it this week. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Stop! Try this? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob and Malika have this weird chemistry. I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's sexual energy, whatever. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Robert. Hold-- just hold it like this? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you hear that Rob and Malika are obsessed with each other and it's disgusting? Rob will just tell us they really want to bone or, like, "I want her to be my girlfriend." But now I love messing with them, 'cause either one of them is irritated, one gets uncomfortable. Like, I think it's funny, so it's a game. They put their tongues down each other's throats in front of me. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, we don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They get naked. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, we don't, Mom. She does this to us all the time. Malika is an attractive woman, I'm not gonna lie. But I would never date Malika, because she's Khloe's best friend and personal assistant. It's just, it's too weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They rub each other all day long. They're always whispering to each other. &gt;&gt; ROB: Everywhere we go, Khloe makes comments on how Malika and I should hook up or start kissing, and it's just starting to get really old. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you feel about these two having sexual intercourse on a regular basis? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe! &gt;&gt; ROB: Kendall, Kylie, tell her to stop. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Put your hand over your sister's mouth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Touch my face, I'll beat you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you want to do this yourself, don't you? Okay, do it yourself. There you go. Do it yourself. Come on, get it in there. Hey, that was pretty good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Masey Mase. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mase just had a meal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have a boogie? Do you have a boogie? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Run from her, run from her! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's almost out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Leave the poor child alone. This is child abuse! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not child abuse. It's a booger. Today we're having a family barbeque, and I've invited the BG5 girls over to meet the family. I have a really big decision to make about the possibility of me managing these girls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello, everybody. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Hi! &gt;&gt; GIRL: How are you? &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Welcome! Kendall and Kylie, why don't you get the girls something to drink. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get them a shot and a beer. &gt;&gt; GIRL: I like this guy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can hang with me, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; GIRL: Taking over the world. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What a coincidence, so 169 00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,301 am I! I know. What have you guys got going on, as far as, like, your hair and makeup glam team? &gt;&gt; GIRL: We are our own glam team. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Pretty much everything, styling, everything is... &gt;&gt; GIRL: Comes from our closets. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. We have to talk about getting a little look together, you know. Sooner or later, you know, you can mix it up. But at first, getting so where-- like, they know that's you and that's your look. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Yeah, that's where we... &gt;&gt; GIRL: Have trouble. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Yeah, because-- and would really trust you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to start thinking about that, and that's how you create your brand. Like, what's your look, what's gonna be your signature thing. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Right. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Who's out there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The baby. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: These girls are so sweet, and I love hanging out with them. But I have to figure out whether or not this is the right business decision for me. Thank you. And I'll talk to Kenneth. Kenneth, call me tomorrow morning. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Bye! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, have fun. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Thanks for having us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How much experience do you have in managing music groups? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a lot of experience managing girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, even if you bought CDs, doesn't mean that you know the music business. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: When was the last time you listened to a song? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You listen to the same tape-- Luther Vandross... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wasn't born in the Dark Ages. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe you should buy the... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I actually know what I'm talking about once in a while. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom has always had more on her plate than she can handle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. I'll do that for you right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: She books me on an audition and a photo shoot on the same day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Obviously, I made a mistake today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, yeah, you shouldn't take on too many responsibilities that you can't handle. I mean, she's managing our entire family, and now she wants to manage this band. What does she even know about the music business anyway? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you actually going to do this? You're working 18 hours a day, and you want to take on something else? Are you kidding me? That's just what we need. More girls around here. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hey, what are you doing, other than stuffing your face? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm trying to load the dishwasher. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Okay, Robert, what is wrong with your sister? &gt;&gt; ROB: She's insane. Look at her-- that evil little I'm really sick and tired of Khloe always embarrassing me about hooking up with Malika. There's got to be a way to get her to stop. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: If we really were, like, seeing each other... &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: ...she would her pants. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. So are you saying we're gonna start hooking up? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm not saying for real, Robert. Focus. &gt;&gt; ROB: Right. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: We need to make her think that we're, like, seriously dating, and she's got something to worry about. &gt;&gt; ROB: You are kind of like my sister, though. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: She'd be disgusted if we were really sleeping together. She really want this? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, she will lose it. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, she's not even gonna know what to do with herself, honestly. The best way to get back at Khloe for embarrassing us is to give her a taste of her own medicine. You want to see us date, we're gonna date. And you're gonna hate it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Two in the One in the steak. Two in the One in the steak. 244 00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,602 &gt;&gt; MALIKA: This guy is a sicko. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. How are you? Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; GIRL: I'll kiss you through the glass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is awesome. I'm stopping by the studio today to talk to the girls about working together. I've made my decision, and now I just hope it's the right one. I think that you guys are so amazing as a group. I know you guys have, um, asked me to be a part of your little family here. I'm gonna have to just, um, pass. Because I'm just overwhelmed with what's going on with my girls right now, and I wouldn't do something unless I could give it 150%. I wish I could take these girls on, because I adore them, but it's just not the right time, and it makes me really sad. Really, I'm getting choked up, because you're so adorable, and I want to see you guys do well. All right, give me a hug. Bye, you guys. &gt;&gt; WOMEN: Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ugh! That was hard. That was really, really hard. &gt;&gt; KENNETH: You know, let this pass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know why I'm so emotional. You've got a really good thing here, and I just wish you all the best. Bye, Kenneth. &gt;&gt; KENNETH: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; ROB: I love hickeys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. We're trying to watch a movie. Stop! Ew! &gt;&gt; SINGER: ♫ Take A little moment to live... ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel so bad. I just don't think I made the right decision. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Rob? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Malik. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm coming to pick up Rob. We're going to dinner. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you kidding, or being serious? Why don't you invite me? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's date night, and you can't come. Robert! Come on, let's go! You ready? &gt;&gt; ROB: Ooh, you look beautiful! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Thanks, Robby. Love a man in black. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I love a woman who's black. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is great. She is just going to go ape &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You'rewith me, right? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. We're going to dinner. Do you want anything? I'll bring it back for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I come? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. I need to get to know your friend a little better. Don't wait up for me, beautiful. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Queen Khloe, have you seen Rob? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's still on his date. Why? You want to play video games? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. Duh. It's either that, or lay down with my beautiful wife. So Rob went on a date with Malika. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I mean, they're definitely gonna get together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I can see her probably giving him a nice little tug. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob and Malika have been on this date for almost three hours. What the hell are they doing? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: She's not gonna tell you everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's Malika. She tells me everything all the time. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Malika. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Malik. Oh. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, are you guys going on another date, or...? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Um, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: We'll go on another date. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you are not. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Why not? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's incest. That is disgusting. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's not incest, yo. We should embrace this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, you know, I have to go. I can't... Love you. Got to go. Bye. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Holler. &gt;&gt; ROB: Click. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You encourage this. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's going to be serious. Malika can probably get him by the little &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is disgusting. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm just playing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. I'm in the office. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nothing. Just, um, dropped Mason off to hang out with Scott. What's going on? You seem like something's bothering you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel kind of down, and I turned down the BG5 Girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, it's a lot of work. And I think that you have so much going on right now. I mean, you're doing it for me, Kim, Khloe, Bruce, Kendall, Kylie, you know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It doesn't stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know my mom's upset about her decision to not manage BG5, but I honestly think it will be for the best in the long run. You have plenty going on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do have to show up at their showcase. So will go with me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I mean, you can always support them. So we'll go. It'll be fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, good. Let's shake on it. Whoo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you, doll. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hey, K.K. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, sugar. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: What are you doing? You organizing my mess? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. My phone cut out with Lauren, so... She'll probably call back. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: What's up? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Got it, got it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Why are you...? &gt;&gt; ROB: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I actually forgot you were here. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just-- I did cleaning, because your husband... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You're cleaning in your underwear. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I was just out of the shower and I almost slipped because Lamar spilled tea last night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, he made me tea. &gt;&gt; ROB: All over. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's sweet of him. &gt;&gt; ROB: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Good to see you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are so weird together. So do you, like, actually like Rob? Like, I'm confused. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Of course I like Rob. I've always liked Rob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Rob's a good kisser. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Malika, you are disgusting, seriously. So did you guys have sex? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: He looks great naked. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! Seriously, you are disgusting! Not only are they together, but now they're doing it in my 363 00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,179 house? This is a nightmare. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't watch this. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Give him-- like, really tongue it down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I was just kissing him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, watch the movie. This is, like, movie night, not kissing night. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, so let's all watch it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is disgusting, and my brain is gonna crumble 'cause I cannot take information like this. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; ROB: Guess where I'm touching Malika right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Who gets the first guess? &gt;&gt; ROB: If you know what kind of man I am, you would know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. &gt;&gt; ROB: I love hickeys on my neck. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, we're trying to watch a movie! Stop! I can't hear. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, I'm actually having a lot of fun playing with Khloe, messing with her mind. But getting a rubdown from Malika is an added bonus. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Who's the belly? Whose belly is this? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's my belly. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Whose belly is this? &gt;&gt; ROB: Now go a little bit lower. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, come on. Stop. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think my penis got a little hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I have that effect on people. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's crazy. That kid is funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Watching Khloe get this upset makes all this that much more rewarding. Payback's a bitch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just getting nauseous now. 399 00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,923 &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Did she really leave? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was disgusting! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it'll be fun for us, right? Hey, everybody. It's a little awkward being at the BG5 showcase, since I've turned them down. But this is the first time I've ever seen them perform live, so I'm really excited. Oh, my, girls. Look how cute they look. &gt;&gt; BG5: ♫ Take a little moment To leave all your tension ♫ If I scratch your back You need to scratch mine ♫ You need to get yours I need to get mine ♫ So scratch DJ, do it, DJ, DJ ♫ Just scratch Look around, ooh, ooh, ooh Scratch ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: These girls are amazing. I'm so loving this, but I just feel so sad that I can't be on board and help them reach their full potential. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good job, girls. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Bye, people. We're BG5. Thank you for coming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come outside with me for a minute. I'm just so emotional. I can't-- I just don't even know why I'm this emotional. I seriously feel so bad that I might not be a part of that. I just don't think I made the right decision. &gt;&gt; ROB: We were thinking of, uh, moving in, like, finding a place together. 425 00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,177 &gt;&gt; I can't-- I just don't even know why I'm this emotional. And I seriously feel so bad that I might not be a part of that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't laugh at me. I really feel this way. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm really trying not to. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't think I made the right decision. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Seeing how emotional my mom is getting makes me realize I was being a little bit selfish. I guess I just didn't realize these girls mean so much to her. I mean, I didn't know that you felt this way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't either. I mean, sitting in there watching them, it's like I kind of, like, discovered for the first time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And Kenneth, you. Little powwow. Kourtney, you want to come with me? Be my little support system. You guys are really amazing, and I get such a great feeling and a great energy. And I just got so emotional watching you guys perform. And I think, if you guys will still have me, I would love to be your co-manager with Kenneth. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Yes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: So exciting! I'm so happy that these girls have embraced me and believe in me, because I really believe in them. And this is gonna be a wonderful relationship. I'm so excited to be co-manager of the BG5 girls. Yay! I have a new job! &gt;&gt; ROB: Let's just tell her, like, we're gonna get-- I don't know, like, I got you pregnant or we're gonna move in together or some &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Okay, okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: Watching Khloe squirm all week and just be disturbed by Malika and I, um, has been wonderful, but I think it's time to take it to the next level. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: K.K. Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What now? Seriously. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You gonna tell her? &gt;&gt; ROB: We just-- I'm being serious right now. This is no We're thinking of, uh, moving in together. Okay, is that gonna weird you out? I mean, I thought you would like me to get out of your space... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, no, sounds like a good idea. &gt;&gt; ROB: You want me out of the house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this real? Like, you guys really are gonna go? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm in love with you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Joke's on you, chick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What, that you guys are moving in together? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe, we're kidding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: About what? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: About all of this. We've beenthe whole time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's just not funny. Say you'resorry! Who is the queenbitch? &gt;&gt; ROB: You and Malika. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Good answer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now you're afraid, huh? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe! I told you to stop! &gt;&gt; ROB:bitch! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so relieved that they really were just with me, because I realized I do not ever want them to hook up. Ow. &gt;&gt; ROB: Bye. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Never play with us again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where you going? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to go have a meeting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are they going? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I didn't tell you, when Mom made me go see the BG5 girls, she peed on herself. She's, like, running. She's, like, "Khloe, I really have to pee." Like, she was-- Bible-- like, holding her vagina. I'm like, "Well, that's not my problem." So I bought Depends earlier, 'cause I knew you guys... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So where are they? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait, can I open them? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think a small-medium's gonna fit her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you guys have to help me, like, make her do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, she's doing it. Even though my mom is the new manager for the BG5 girls, we're definitely not gonna let her forget who her real bosses are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have an announcement to make. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, gosh, what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, the other day, Mom peed on herself. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom peed on herself? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bible-- she peed on herself. So I made a deal. I said, "If you want to come back into this car, you're gonna have to wear one of these beautiful adult Depend diapers." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not going to wear a diaper. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, Mom, we shook on it. We made a deal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Put on the diaper! &gt;&gt; ALL: Diaper! Diaper! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not putting on a diaper! I'm not gonna do this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, um, actually, you are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm actually not. I don't want to wear a diaper! &gt;&gt; ROB: It's really on. You look crazy! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, stop it! You're cutting my leggings, Khloe! You're gonna cut my skin! Look at all of you, you're crazy. &gt;&gt; ROB: Look at you, you're wearing a diaper. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That does not look sexy, honey. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: We can't just have sex just to have sex. I need to get pregnant ASAP. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I spot Scott butt naked. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh... my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We have rules in this house. No boys up here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad, just leave! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom and Dad know 530 00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,266 you're here? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No.
