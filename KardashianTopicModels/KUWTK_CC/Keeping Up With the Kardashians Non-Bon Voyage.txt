- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are we gonna do about St. Barths? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, the perfect time for a family vacation. I think we all need it. I think we should just do all girls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is the craziest thing. What does that even mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe changed her number to have a clean start, and she gets a call from Lamar. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This whole thing shouldn't ever be happening. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tell me one reason why they should even communicate after she's finally had the balls to divorce him. Khloe has done everything in her power to try and save this relationship. Now that she's finally moved on, my mom just kind of set everything back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You and I need a major break from each other. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think we need to be separated. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys go on this vacation, I-I don't... I am just gonna stay home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Should I get a new deodorant? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: They have lavender and white tea. This is the kind of deodorant Mom uses. Do you think Mom smells? &gt;&gt; MASON: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: She doesn't? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just feel like, since I'm pregnant, my deodorant hasn't been working the way that I would like it to. Do you even know what deodorant is? &gt;&gt; MASON: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Deodorant is something... that you put on your underarms so that you don't really have to sweat, or if you do sweat, it doesn't smell bad. Okay, wait. You're gonna help me out, here. Should I try this one? Smell. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yes! &gt;&gt; KIM: That smells nice, right? Okay, you hold that, since that's a yes. ♫ ♫ Too strong? I think too strong. &gt;&gt; MASON: Too strong. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to smell. That's good. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think... okay. So this is gonna be good, so we just have two. That's all we need, right? &gt;&gt; MASON: Give me this. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we are good. Your mom will be so happy for me, that I'm trying an all-natural deodorant. Do you even understand what this means? &gt;&gt; MASON: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's go tell her. &gt;&gt; MASON: I don't understand anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Hello! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey. Oh, I love these chairs. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I know, I got all new furniture. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Where are these from? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Some designer had 'em. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wow. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: That's, actually, like... they're really pretty cool. Come here. Sit down. It's always interesting when you come over. You know why? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I want to see what color your hair is. That's the only reason I invite you over, you know that? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: How you been? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Good. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Kendall's been gone a lot. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Are you sad? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm used to it. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Not really? You haven't thought about it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I'm just used to it. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: How's that Ferrari working out? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's really good. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: It kind of scares me a little bit. I have not seen you drive it. To have a high-performance car like that, you kind of gotta know what you're doing. So here's my deal: driving school, at the racetrack. You can bring that car out and work it. What do you think? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm down. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: You're down? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Since my dad isn't going on the family trip to St. Barths, it will be really nice to spend time together. So I'm excited to go race with my dad. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: We'll go out, have some fun. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I like your ring. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Do you have enough rings? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: No? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, well, well. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. I just got those and those and those. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: You love to copy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not copying, Monica brought it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You left these at my house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, thank God. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, what was the text that you're not coming on the trip? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I just don't think I... that my heart can handle any more abuse from you guys, when you get mad... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When did I abuse you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you didn't. It was Khloe and Kim. Mostly Kim, and it's not even her ex-husband. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe was so upset, so I was sticking up for her. I don't think I said anything that was, like, crazy to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's the problem, is you don't realize how much you hurt people with your words. Kim can be super aggressive and super harsh. &gt;&gt; KIM: You make the worst decisions. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She doesn't tell me all the information. &gt;&gt; KIM: You sound so stupid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, then I'm stupid! She's way out of line to speak to me like this. I would never do anything to intentionally upset my kids, I just love Lamar. And she's got to respect that, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: You just have a sentimental thing with Lamar, and at some point, you have to get over it. Because what you did created... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...a bigger stream of problems. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, but you weren't going to give me the benefit of the doubt. I always want what's best for my daughter, absolutely. I want her... &gt;&gt; KIM: Her talking to Lamar and you saying, "Lamar deserves a second chance," that is so wrong and a... that's being a bad mother. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, what else do you want to call me? I would never speak to somebody the way you speak to anybody. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's the truth. And the truth hurts. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, your words hurt. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't hold accountability for thinking that Lamar deserves a second chance in Khloe's life? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't say he now deserves to be back as her husband, okay? I was just saying people in general... &gt;&gt; KIM: Even for them to speak... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...it's not healthy for Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's none of my business, I can't control that. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's moved on and now you're... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, she has. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...you, solely, are pulling her back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you're out of your mind. Kim, just stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: All we were looking for is for you to say, ", I up, I'm so sorry." &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's exactly why I don't want to go on the trip with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Then don't go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't want to be yelled at anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: There is nothing that bothers me more in life than someone that doesn't take accountability for their actions. We all just want to have a good time in St. Barths, so if my mom is just gonna sit and play the victim, let's leave her home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom said, "I'm done for the day. Get her out of my house. She will be moved out by the time she gets home; she can stay with Kourt." &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I'll gladly move out. What a nice mother she is. Putting out a pregnant woman and a child. I just don't even understand what my mom was thinking. Write her back and say, "Kim will gladly move out." &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: On the throttle, on the throttle, on the throttle. Nice. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Don'twith me. I woke up at 6:30. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I actually can't believe that Kylie's leaving right now. She doesn't have her priorities straight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're here! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: "Lamar Odom Speaks Out." In magazine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so confused. This is so out of character for him. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Lamar insists, 'That woman is my wife.'" ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, it's good to do something with my little girl. Are you excited, scared? What is it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm excited. &gt;&gt; CANDIS: So was your car taken out here for you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yay! You can go as fast as you want! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How is this legal, to go as fast as you want? &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, it's a racetrack. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Fun. I am so excited to race my car. I have always wanted to do it. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: We're gonna go pretty slow and you're gonna kind of get an idea of where the track is. First. Okay, second. Maybe that's a little fast. Slow it down. Wait, wait, wait, wait... Ah, you got a little wide on that one. Keep it... wah, wah, wah. Is this fun? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I want to go fast! &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Hit it now. On the throttle, on the throttle, on the throttle, on the throttle. Keep it in this gear. Stay to the outside. Nice. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That was a good one. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah, that was a good one. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yay! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hello. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: It's a playdate! Oh, there's Kylie. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Puppy! Let's go! Oh, my God! How are you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You need to give her some water. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think she might not be okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, she's okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's really hot. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right, I'm-a take her, I'm-a take her. Want to go? Yeah. All right, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you leaving? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Soon. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We've been here since 7:00 in the morning. So... don'twith me, I woke up at 6:30. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You should stay for a skidpad. It's really fun-- you learn how to do doughnuts. You literally get to learn how to do a doughnut, legally. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I've just been here... I've just been here a really long time. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: All right. All right, Kendall. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I actually can't believe that Kylie's leaving right now, just 'cause we never get to spend time with each other. I travel a ton for work, and even when I'm home in L.A., I feel like I don't even really get to see Kylie as often as I'd like to, and to have a moment to spend time with your dad and your sister, I would take it. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Now, what's the deal with Kylie? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She probably saw the opportunity that you were occupied and she could go home and do whatever she wants to do. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, don't-don't say stuff like that, 'cause it's not, it's... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But seriously, she prob... if I'm being honest, she was here for you, and then saw that I was here and felt it was her opportunity to leave and go back to being with her friends. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Well, that may be true, that may be true. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I mean, whatever... &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: 'Cause last night I tried to get her to go to dinner, and she... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She doesn't have her priorities straight. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I-I was just curious, I didn't think it was anything I had done. Or you had done. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. No, it's nothing that we had done. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Yeah, okay. All right, well, we're gonna do the skidpads and stuff. There you go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, babe. Do you want a glass of wine? &gt;&gt; COREY: I-I wanted some, but I'd rather have you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you can, uh, share mine. &gt;&gt; COREY: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Want some? &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah. Ah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um... good. I'm trying to decide... whether or not to go to St. Barths. &gt;&gt; COREY: Is that why you're looking all gloomy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just trying to make a decision, and it, like... I just, I feel like I shouldn't go. I feel like it's just gonna be a storm of... nonsense. You know? &gt;&gt; COREY: Not necessarily. I think you should just kind of be the queen you are and just know they're being kids and just go enjoy the family. What's the family without the mom, the boss lady? ♫ ♫ The founder. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But that-that's the problem is they... they're not kids, they just act like kids. &gt;&gt; COREY: Well, look at the glass half-full, you know? These are, um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do. &gt;&gt; COREY: ...young, uh, young women that really look up to you, so think about how you are. You can't get emotionally attached to their attitudes. They're gonna be what they're gonna be. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yep. I think that my decision is to go ahead and go on the family vacation. I didn't go on the last one, and I have great regrets over that because we make such amazing memories and I don't want to miss another trip, especially when my grandkids are coming. &gt;&gt; COREY: They learned it from the best. And keep it moving. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll keep it moving. &gt;&gt; COREY: Yeah, baby. Think about how many times you might have got under MJ's skin. I'm sure 200 million, billion times that you got up under MJ's skin. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, let's not get carried away. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One, two... three. Come on. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We just landed in St. Barths. I've always wanted to go to St. Barths. I've never been to Saint anything, so I'm super-excited. This landing strip is absolutely insane. I personally was not looking out the window, because I was told not to or else we would be terrified. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That is the craziest landing. Why wouldn't we come in from that side? That's what I don't get. &gt;&gt; KIM: They said it's a famous airport and people come just to watch that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We took a boat here. We had our own little yacht with Uncle Frank and Aunt Kathy... when you were three months... five months old. &gt;&gt; KIM: So my mom decided to come on the trip, and I am just gonna let it go. St. Barths is so beautiful. I've always wanted to come here. I want to have a great vacation with my sisters and my daughter, and I'm just not gonna pay any attention to her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So pretty. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm gonna spy on surfers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. I want to spy with you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: We are here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're here! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my goodness, look how pretty it is! &gt;&gt; KIM: So cute! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is beautiful. Oh, my God. I swear I thought that was Scott for a second. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, could you imagine? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought that was Scott for a second, this guy with the plaid shirt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; BENJAMIN: Hi, I'm Benjamin. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; BENJAMIN: My partner and I will welcome to Hotel La Banane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, this is so cute. &gt;&gt; BENJAMIN: Nice to meet you too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my goodness, sister, look where we are. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is so cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Want to go find your rooms, guys? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think I'm here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, you're right there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: They're so cute. I love it. Where's Kylie's room? I'm super-excited about this family trip. It's our first all-girls trip. Kylie's on her way, and I'm really excited to, like, do weird, random, adventurous things together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They said we're gonna see turtles. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God! There was, like, a iguana! It's giant! Oh, my God, that is the creepiest thing ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Lizard, Mase. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, how cool is this house? Really cool. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Look at the little puppy. Look at the little puppy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Want more water? Think the doggie wants some water. &gt;&gt; BENJAMIN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Why drink water? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's thirsty, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, this is cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So how did... 'cause I just don't get, like, how all this... and Mom ended up coming. Did you talk to her again? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I've seen her in the house, obviously. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How is she kicking you out for something she did? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, she thinks I'm just, like, mean. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She said, "Oh..." 'Cause I told you how she was like, "I don't... You don't know the whole story." &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to get, like, drawn back into it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I know, but then she, like, denies e-everything. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just like, "How am I getting in the middle of this?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: "I'm just sticking up for Khloe 'cause she was so upset." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am still pissed at my mom. Island life is supposed to be, like, calm; it's, like, more slow, laid back. So I have to stay away, keep my distance, because it will be better for the both of us, at the end of the day. We can't get back into it again, it's literally... &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to get back into it, it's, like, the longest flight ever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to enjoy this environment, but when I got on the plane, I saw her, I wanted to go, "Oh, you're coming." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, so cute. Beautiful. Mmm, it's amazing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: One, two, three! Okay, P. One, two, three! You have floaties on, you silly goose. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's fine. They do it every day. Like, they've literally done it so... it's, like, how they land the planes here. Like, they're kind of famous for it, but it's... uh, it's fine. They've never had an accident where anyone's ever been hurt. It's literally a ten-minute flight, and the process is two minutes long. You'll be fine. Hello? ♫ ♫ Once I got on the plane and I was terrified, I knew Kylie would be even more scared, 'cause she is just in general scared of flying. &gt;&gt; FEMALE VOICE: Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I hate her so much sometimes. I really wish Kylie would get on this plane, 'cause then she would just get here quicker and we could hang out. It's a little annoying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He said they're in a hotel or something. People keep telling me that Scott has gone out of town. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You'll die when you hear this story. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How could you not call? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey! &gt;&gt; KIM: You know Tyga's coming. So he's, like, joining the family vacay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, no, Kylie, you could have taken this time to be with your family. What were you thinking? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WAITER: Here you go. Pasta salad with, uh, mushroom, garlic and basil. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Chinese chicken salad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What kind of accent is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing till shopping and dinner? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. I haven't really thought about it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We should start planning activities. No, literally, I can't sit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, yeah, we didn't come here-- &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I enjoyed chilling out for a little bit, but then I want to, like, do something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agree. I don't want to sit here all day, but I'm also pissed the paparazzi knows where we are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can't let it ruin your, don't let it kill your vibe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just don't want to be in a bathing suit, and then-- fuego body. Who gives a flyingif you are even fat and like--? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, Kourtney, yes! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You got to live your life; this is your life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, ladies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have white wine? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Yeah, I do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want white wine? &gt;&gt; WAITER: I'll go bring some over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would love a glass of wine. You can just pour, it's okay. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm, thank you. I know that it tastes fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And if it didn't taste good, you would-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You would still drink it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You got that right. So, wait-- is there any update on Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, Joe just said, "Oh, my God, you'll die when you hear this story." And then I, he said, "Call me." But I called and he didn't answer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was gonna say, "How could you not call?" I would be like, "Dahling..." I would be calling and calling. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He said they're in a hotel or something. People keep telling me that Scott has gone out of town, but, like, at this point, there's really nothing that I could hear that's worse than anything else I've heard. So I just want to enjoy my vacation, and not spend it thinking about what Scott's up to, because at this point it just doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who wanted white wine? Is it legal to drink here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What, now you're gonna step in? Now you have something to say? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall and Kylie are, can legally drink right now on this island? That's the scariest thing I've ever heard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ten, nine, eight... I only got down to eight. Pretty good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To talk me out of, like, being crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Screaming at me and going, "That's your infomercial voice." No, but seriously... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do you want to go ride on the things while they're getting ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Go put clothes on. I'm gonna go put my pants on. Squad meet up in ten. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's okay. I'm good. No need to worry about me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you so much for food. &gt;&gt; KRIS:fabulous. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Sister? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! ♫ ♫ We all came to St. Barths to get away, I think, from all of our problems and just kind of have a release of life and enjoy and step away. I cannot hear the moaning and the groaning and the complaining. And thank God Kendall's here. And thank God I have a partner in crime. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, it's coming right here! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is so scary. : Khloe! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Right-- Oh, my God! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What a beautiful restaurant. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Who's going paragliding? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I truly think you're gonna pussy out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm not! First of all, have more faith in your sister. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, 'cause I know you're terrified of the ocean, so I think you're gonna get out there-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it's clear ocean! So if it's clear, I'm not gonna be scared! You guys always take me to dark waters. Why would I want to swim where it's black? Where the black monster is. There's a big sea lion under me or whatever they are, a sea monster. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Since when have you ever been afraid of a big, black snake? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not afraid of a big, black snake. I'm afraid of a big, black, big I'm going. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall, you know Tyga's coming. Kylie invited Tyga. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When is he coming? &gt;&gt; KIM: Tomorrow. So he's, like, joining the family vacay. Um, I think it's just weird that she wouldn't ask any of us, especially since we made it a point to have it be a girls' trip. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally, like... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You could've taken this time to be with your family. I'm sure we all had someone we wanted to bring. Mom, Khloe... So that's a little annoying. I was really looking forward to being with Kylie on this trip. And not that I don't love Tyga, but having him around kind of takes Kylie away from me. I don't think spending time with me is very important to her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think she's doing anything maliciously. I think you guys are a little hard on her, because you guys forget that you all went through the same thing. I could bring up some memories of some real doozies where you guys have brought your boyfriends and really didn't ask anybody, just said this one's coming or that one's coming. I don't think Kylie knew that it was all-girls trip, because I told Kylie it was okay to bring Tyga. She just turned 18, and this is the first time that she's really been able to go on a family trip with a boyfriend. And we all had your boyfriends on our trips. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, I get it. I'd rather be with a man, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: I actually would. I would love to be here with my family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I understand where you're coming from. I'm just saying try to be understanding. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, I just found this girl's Instagram. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. So, Scott's with two girls? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is the first trip without Scott. He's still causing a problem. I just hope it doesn't ruin the trip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is why God made treadmills. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're such a downer. Yeah, seriously. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm feeling like the fifth wheel. Maybe coming on this trip was a mistake. I'm exhausted. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, stop complaining. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ky! Kylie? You, oh, you need to wake up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's daytime? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie ended up taking the ferry, which made her get in last night, and she went straight to sleep, so I don't really get to spend any time with her before Tyga gets here. &gt;&gt; MASON: And then me and P have new, big hands. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is how Kylie gets woken up. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are these to, like, wake me up, these tools? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shake her hand with your new hand. Say nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I had boat rides and it took three planes to get to St. Barths, so I'm a little jet-lagged. Sorry, guys, I just need more sleep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Come on, out the room. Say bye to Kylie. &gt;&gt; MASON: Bye, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! P, say bye. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye, P. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: P doesn't want to talk, let's go. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; LOiC: Good morning. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good morning. Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good, how are you? &gt;&gt; LOiC: I'm good, thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello, nice to see you. I'm Kris. What's your name? &gt;&gt; LOiC: Loic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Loic? &gt;&gt; LOiC: Loic, yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; LOiC: How are you? Loic. So you are ready to work out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Kourtney has joined my therapy system in working out. She has fallen in love with working out, just as I have. And so, we have planned to have a trainer in St. Barths; someone local. We want to be active, be outside. Like, explore St. Barths. &gt;&gt; LOiC: We're gonna do the hike. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The hike we're really excited about. It's gonna be beautiful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, I just found this girl's Instagram. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. So, Scott's with two girls? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I guess. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're having drama. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're just Instagram-stalking some people. Let me see. People keep sending me screen grabs of different Instagrams and pictures of Scott here and there, and it's like, I don't even want to know, but then, you know, it's, like, how can you not look? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's that chick? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. One of the people tagged. Oh, it's... yeah, she was there. And, like, on this... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Not cute at all. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott's in Mexico. This is the first trip without him. He's still causing a problem. I think Kourtney needs to just not really worry about what everyone's texting. I feel bad that she's, you know, paying attention to it. I just hope it doesn't ruin the trip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, guys. Get off your e-mail. It's time to work out. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so proud of all of you guys. You guys are in such good shape. You really take this seriously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was, and then I fell off. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, you did not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I kind of did, and then I told people after the Hamptons, "Never bring Nilla cookies around me again," and they were in that room last night, and Kylie and I were in there for a good seven minutes. And a lot of damage could be done in seven minutes. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think I see a shiny thing in the sky. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, there's a plane right there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What was that?! I am so excited to see Tyga. I love having T around. I feel like he just keeps me sane and he always wants to do everything that I want to do and we love going on adventures. Yay! &gt;&gt; TYGA: Yo, that was the craziest landing ever. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No way. &gt;&gt; TYGA: That was. You wouldn't believe; I was scared. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I watched a little bit of it, like, I saw your plane coming in. &gt;&gt; TYGA: And that runway was so short, it was just like... You would've freaked out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is the first time I'm bringing a guy on a family trip, so I'm a little nervous about how it's gonna go. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; LOiC: Here we are. Let's go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, this is pretty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: I swear, I could look totally not pregnant in photos. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to go all the way back? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is why God made treadmills. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? This is so much nicer than being inside. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, what are you even talking about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm kidding. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're such a downer to work out with. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's be positive. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, seriously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To hear someone in the back of me saying, "That's why God created treadmills"? No. God created Mother Nature, this mountain, this beautiful beach that we're hiking on. Like, when are we gonna do this again? Let's enjoy it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Girls, get over here. We all need a selfie. Kourtney, get over here. Look at this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is happening? &gt;&gt; KIM: How pretty is that selfie? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom wants to be in it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Will you get out? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whatever. Forget it. One day, when I'm gone, you guys are gonna try to find a picture of me and you're gonna go, "I remember the time we were in this city," and then you're gonna look and go, "Nope, she's not in it." &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I have so many pictures to remember. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hate to be a baby, but I'm feeling like the fifth wheel. It's my vacation, too. I want to have fun and I want to bond with my kids and when they're angry, I feel... not right. Maybe coming on this trip was a mistake. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Debbie Downer's coming, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need a raft and a drink. I'm exhausted. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, stop complaining. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. You guys are a tough crowd today. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was, like, specifically a girls' trip and had said that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She has to, like, make an effort to be with us. And bringing your boyfriend on a vacation is not making an effort at all. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. "Lamar insists, 'That woman is my wife.'" &gt;&gt; KRIS: We also have to consider... &gt;&gt; KIM: He did an interview, Mom. He sat down with them. Stop protecting him. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...I only have it to look. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Got a new member. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: New member! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Welcome. &gt;&gt; TYGA: How you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Welcome to Hotel La Banane. &gt;&gt; TYGA: You guys take that flight out here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scary. &gt;&gt; KIM: I literally have whiplash; I have whiplash. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, for sure. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where did the name "Tyga" come from? &gt;&gt; TYGA: You really want to know? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I really want to know. &gt;&gt; TYGA: From, like, my mom. She said that, um, I looked like Tiger Woods when I was little. So she used to call me that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She used to call you "Tiger Woods"? &gt;&gt; TYGA: No, no, no, like, it was "Tiger." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; TYGA: And then I just switched the spelling. T-Y-G-A. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TYGA: Which means, "Thank You God, Always." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh. &gt;&gt; TYGA: So put, like, a little swing on it, you know, like a meaning, you know? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. Oh, cool. &gt;&gt; TYGA: That's how I came up with my rap name. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Fun story. Tell it again. So, like, what's going on today? Are we done with our activity for the day? Do you want to go on that hike later? There's this natural pool in rocks. We should do that. And you can go swim in it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was so worth it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Sunset hike? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: At this point, I can't do anything about Kylie inviting Tyga on the trip, so I'm just gonna make the best of it and hope that we can kind of all do things together? &gt;&gt; TYGA: Is it a long hike? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, 30 minutes. We did it this morning. Like, we jumped in... it was, like, a lagoon. It was like, there was no waves. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't think I'm just gonna want to be ready. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's here. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Why are we going back and forth, KoKo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, back and forth like rocking? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: But why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause there's waves in the ocean. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I may not use that. I might just stay on... oh, yeah, I'll have it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Want to come, T? &gt;&gt; TYGA: What if we flip over? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We won't. Come on. You just swam. &gt;&gt; TYGA: Want to do this? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I actually really like Tyga and I enjoy that he's here, but I really thought Kylie would do this with me, 'cause we really love to do adventurous stuff together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mason, are you driving? That's so cute. Have fun, Mase. Tyga and Kylie...? Does anyone care that Kylie and T are just doing the damn thing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She has to, like, make an effort to be with us. And bringing your boyfriend on a vacation is not making an effort at all to hang out with us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, right now, her and Tyga are downstairs sleeping. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was, like, specifically a girls' trip and we had said that. And I don't know if that memo got to Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's also not Tyga's job. It's more Kylie's job to, like, you know, like, balance it all. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar had a sit-down In Touch. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I saw something about him saying... him admitting he's still in love with you and that you're still in love with him. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you have purple veins. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I... &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that what you were talking about? You talk to me about your veins all day long and now, when I say, "Oh, I see what you were talking about..." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I never even... This one? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, that one, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought you could get those lasered. It's like, I'm sorry, after seeing that Caitlyn could go from a man to a woman, you could do anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. I don't know if you want to hear this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just got an e-mail. This is so sad. "Lamar Odom Speaks Out, Calls Khloe 'My Wife' and 'Soul Mate.' 'We'll never be parted.' During the lengthy interview magazine..." In magazine. "...Lamar insists 'That woman is my wife. Without the ring on my finger. Even with her picture being taken with another man, this woman is still my wife. She's my soul mate,' Lamar told the mag." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't get why Lamar is saying this and making things so public right now. I think it's so out of character for him. I'm so confused. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Lamar also said, 'We'll never be apart. I will never consider myself serious with another woman. To sum it up, if a man is attempting to court Khloe, he's probably wasting his time. Seeing Khloe with another man is weird, because I really know how she feels about me.'" Why is he meeting with these people, day after day? &gt;&gt; KRIS: But we also have to magazine is taking stuff from the... &gt;&gt; KIM: He did an interview, Mom. He sat down with them. Stop protecting him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not protecting him. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are. You are. We're not going to get into this whole fight all over again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How pretty. We got the good seats, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We get the ocean. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is so pretty. &gt;&gt; TYGA: Think I'm gonna get a black light tattoo on my face. It's gonna be, like, almost clear. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, in the dark--? &gt;&gt; TYGA: So, like, if I had it on-- &gt;&gt; KENDALL: But even on your skin tone? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't risk it. You better find out. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, you should test it on your skin somewhere else first, 'cause if you, if that happens and then you can see it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Yay! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They have arrived. You look good, everyone. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo, does that bother you or no? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, not in a bad-- I mean, it just makes me sad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know why he's, I've never known him to be that whatsoever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar had a sit-down In Touch. &gt;&gt; KIM: In the interview, he's like, "I know Khloe still tells me she's in love with me--" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He said he didn't want anyone to date me again. But why would it be two and a half years later are you now gonna say this? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think he's making it seem like Khloe is still in love with him, so it's harder for another guy to want to, like, jump in. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel bad for Khloe, because I know she's just trying to move on with her life. And what's being written makes it hard to do that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like you can't respond. You can't put up a quote. You can't do any of that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I wasn't online. And now that I am, it's, like, everywhere, that story. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I saw something about him saying, him admitting he's still in love with you and that you're still in love with him, but that's all I saw. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everything Lamar's saying is true. Like, I do love Lamar. That's never been a question if we love each other. But Lamar is all talk and no action. For two years, I've wanted Lamar to try. For two years, I've wanted Lamar to show me some effort. But nothing ever changes. It definitely makes me sad, because I still believe he is my soul mate. But sometimes we lose our soul mates and it's okay. You know, right now, I have to do what's best for me. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Anything that's dirty, what do you do with? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's inside out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Socks, bras, T-shirts-- anything. So I know when I'm home what's dirty and what's clean. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are so smart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So everything stays inside out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You should write an organizational book. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do feel bad that I am so hard on my mom. When we date someone, it's, like, my mom's dating them, too, in the best way. She's always supportive. And that's a beautiful trait that she has. But sometimes, she is too involved. I do forgive her for giving out my phone number. It was a mistake. I know her intentions were good. At the end of the day, we both love Lamar, and I love that love that she has for him. And I wouldn't want to change that for anything in the world. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'd like to borrow it for something after you wear it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you could borrow it. See, I'm not like your other daughters. I actually share my clothes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You do. You made me look really good in the south of France. That's cute. All right, now you're making me feel like I should go get organized. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna paint my nails on Saturday. What color should I paint them? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Pink. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Pink? Okay. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Because I want your nails to be pink. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I'll paint pink nails on Saturday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So do you. &gt;&gt; MASON: KoKo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, who said that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Merman. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is there a merman in...? Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's a merman. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I see you. I had no idea who said that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I've never had one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that chicken? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is so good. I cannot wait, guys, for the crepes. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Remember that crepe place we used to go to in Mammoth, Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Um, I've never had a crepe until, like, this year. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where's Tyga? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Over there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Where is he, Mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's like, "I cannot sit with these crazy people anymore." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm gonna bring this to T right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just saying it's a lot to handle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, wait, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What day are you moving out? &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this for real? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just kidding. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, tell me. I would just go to a hotel. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When I was hotel hopping, it was so fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do not egg her on. I just wanted to see what she would say. &gt;&gt; KIM: Till December. &gt;&gt; KRIS: To being roommates for a really long time. &gt;&gt; KIM: You love it. You get all your fashion inspiration. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. You're kind of like a dream come true. And I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Although Khloe is being so strong, I know that she is hurting inside. I can now see Kim's point of view a little bit about giving Lamar Khloe's number. Because it does open up all those wounds again. And so I'm just gonna do the best I can to be there for her and not overstep my boundaries. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We were talking at lunch-- you weren't there-- about who would survive on a deserted island out of all of us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who would? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We said you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They said me and you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would bow out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm right behind her. I'm gonna carry her bags. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You guys don't understand-- I'm a survivor. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think Kylie would be the first down, and actually, Ken, I may have to say you may not be a survivor. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, really? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Her boobs are like two pillows... right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim's? They're huge. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, they're huge. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, they're literally, they're bigger than my little pillows that I have. &gt;&gt; KIM: But what can I do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nothing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're ginormous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously, what can I do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How do your clothes even fit? &gt;&gt; KIM: They don't. That's the problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ken, look. I did investigating this morning and then I found this... and this person and then they tagged all these people, so it was, like, such a good investigating morning. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? I know, like, once you start cyber-stalking someone, constantly checking someone's page, seeing if they posted something new, you become addicted. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This guy we know. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then we were looking-- &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She did, she did tag herself? &gt;&gt; MASON: Mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Yes, Mace? That random girl and then all these people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So for Kourtney to just get so wrapped up in that, I understand it. We've all been there. But I want Kourtney to disconnect from that world for a little bit, 'cause it becomes so unhealthy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna go change so I'll be ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I read something on Kourtney and Scott, so I threw it away. She's just really insecure right now. We have to be a little more sensitive, because she is sensitive, you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's just kind of living on her phone. She keeps, like, looking for stuff, like-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, it becomes, like, obsessive. &gt;&gt; KIM: I see it happen all too much. When so many people post things on social media, I mean, you just know people are gonna send it to Kourtney. So I think Scott kind of knows what he's doing. Every time Kourtney makes a move to just, you know, kind of better herself, he does something to get her attention. And that just makes me sad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then you get fed up, and you're, it's, then you realize how toxic it is. &gt;&gt; KIM: On the next episode... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney can't be the only hot girl here. That's amazing! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you see yourself with somebody else? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not really. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think the one is Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You say, "Oh, I don't have a family," and then we give you one. Why do you, like, destroy it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just been a really hard time going from, like, having all of you guys to having nobody.
