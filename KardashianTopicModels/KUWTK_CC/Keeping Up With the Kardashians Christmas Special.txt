- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, you little elf. Are you ready to decorate for Christmas? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah! Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's decorate the gingerbread house... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then we can put things on it. &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to try! &gt;&gt; KIM: Welcome everyone to our Christmas special. Christmas is a huge deal in our family, and I think this year, so much is going on, so much is changing. But the one thing that stays the same is family and the love that we have for each other. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're eating that. So first, we are going to have our intimate Christmas party where we watch old videos. &gt;&gt; MAN: Come on, Kimberly. This is Christmas Eve. Hi, Kourt. Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fire...! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're gonna open up presents, and do a white elephant gift exchange. Yes! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who bought this? It's a bracelet with "wild" on it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Or open a new one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm stealing a gift, guys. Who's scared? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm scared. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who's scared? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's scared? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm pretty scared, to be honest. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who's scared? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, you are so artistic. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really, like, the least artistic ever, and it really bothers me. Um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You really are. Another family tradition of ours is our Christmas card. &gt;&gt; KIM: The photographer for our Christmas card this year is David LaChapelle. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Beautiful! Right there, don't move. Face towards me. Good. Look at me for one. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've heard that he's, like, so amazing. Kanye shot with him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People think that all of his stuff is on, like, on a green screen, and they're not... That's how elaborate his sets are. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I'm really excited to see the concept, and just to try new things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The same tradition. We're just spicing it up a little bit. And I hope everybody enjoys our Christmas special. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are so excited to share all these memories with you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hope you have a Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was cute, Mase. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love this time of the year. It's my favorite time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ♫ Oh, hello, Mama Jo. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, look who's here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The three divas have arrived, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Merry Christmas, you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sit next to me, darling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you look gorgeous, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, the Jew is here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Scotty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Happy Hanukkah, everybody. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's that time of year. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mazel. Mazel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The Jew's here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it's the Jenner! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ♫ Jingle bells! Jingle bells! ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey! Batman smells. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ♫ Jingle all the way. ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, sing it, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm the last here? I've never been last to anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guess what? There's a first for everything. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: How's your nose? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My nose is better, thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce, what happened? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I actually get the stitches out tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't touch it! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They removed that little red spot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, this Christmas, we have a lot to be thankful for. Only one of us has stitches. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you pop some rosé over there in the corner? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, I'm popping it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, I'm so excited, because I want to be able to have, like, a moment, where we can all share some of our Christmas memories. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Holy! Let'sdo this! &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's a lot of video here from the '80s, the '90s and the 2000's, and I think it'd be really cute for Kendall and Kylie to see some of the past years of these four kids and what their Christmases are like. 85 00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,166 &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do it! &gt;&gt; MAN: What is that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at you. &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's Kim with the pigtails. Every year, the pigtails. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Pretty Khloe. &gt;&gt; MAN: Look at these presents Santa Claus brought. Look at those scooters. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe. This is Khloe's. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Kim, you're so nice to me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I pointed to it. &gt;&gt; MAN: Khloe, a bicycle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: Boy! &gt;&gt; KIM: For our room. Because it's pink. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, did you get an ironing board? She's ironing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Always the cleaner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was so excited for you guys to come downstairs that I don't... I barely slept. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's what Christmas is all about. It's gets fun when you have kids that are getting to that age where they really, really enjoy it, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. The more kids I had, the more exciting it got, and it was just magical. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Year 2002 Christmas. You got to say hi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, wait, wait, wait, no, don't jump around. Kylie, come in here, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw. Kendall and Kylie are so cute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How old are you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm seven. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How old are you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Five for now. I'm five! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall, you're so animated as a kid. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, you girls had more personality back then. ♫ Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way ♫ Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh. ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I find it weird that Christian and Catholic people just lie to their kids about Christmas. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what Santa's all about-- lies. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's for both of you guys. That's for both of you guys. Wait, Christmas morning-- this is the best. Oh, my, goodness! Kylie, oh, my gosh! 125 00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:57,333 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice butt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Merry Christmas! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was cute. You guys were so young. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And they had so much personality back then. You especially, just all this personality. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so, I asked you guys to all bring your sort of secret gift, and everyone's gonna draw a number. You start over here. Rob, you pick one first. And whoever has number one, you get to pick any gift on the table, and then you open it in front of all of us. This is my favorite number! Two! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's a bad one! You're supposed to get the highest number. &gt;&gt; OTHERS: Why? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Because once everybody opens the present, you can go and pick anybody's present. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that's so depressing! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What number? That's good! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's Lamar's number. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a sign. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's good luck. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got four. Take one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have six. That's the number of kids I have. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo-hoo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, who has number one? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, Kylie has number one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You get to pick any gift that you want, and you open it in front of all of us. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think this one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She picks that one! All right! Shoes? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What is this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A windshield mount. For your car. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And a battery pack for your iPhone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It mounts on your windshield with an extension for your iPhone. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ah, Bruce looks like he gift. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, Kourtney, do you want to take hers, or do you want a new one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want that. Ish. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, Kourtney's going no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think I'm gonna do this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right! Hey, we have a decision. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes! It's a double chin... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What is it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a double chin exercise... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys, I wanted it so badly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What is it? It's, like, a pogo stick for double chins. And you go like this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I see, you exercise like this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Don't get too excited, because people... anyone could steal it from you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nobody... nobody 175 00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:02,058 even think about stealing it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, I need that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to show you some videos about Santa. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My bells are ringing already. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He was a little inappropriate. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's good to be Santa. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I won $10,000! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She won $10,000 on a lottery ticket! &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Have you heard about the Christmas card? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What about the Christmas card? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's just gonna be the girls. 186 00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,454 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think that is a terrible decision. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, I'm so excited that you brought your pictures in. You actually followed through with that. Because I want to share Christmas past and have you guys remember some of the good times. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You guys, I want to see all the photos. So can we just share? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so, I want to share mine first. Oh, my God, look at this one, you guys. We're all in the same Dalmatian-- no, wait, Scottie dogs? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, that was the Dalmatian party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scottie dogs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Remember those? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And we wore them that year because Scott and I were broken up. So we wanted to bring Scott into the scene... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So you did care about me when we were broken up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good way to transition that, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What have you got, Kim? 205 00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,901 &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I have got me blowing a kiss to everyone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's the typical Kim shot, blowing the kiss. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yep. And, then, this was just another... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you kidding that they're all of you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that more kisses? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: This was one with my dad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's a great one. And the dog, Paris. &gt;&gt; ROB: That was the first night Khloe and I slept together. Seriously. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, Kylie, whatcha got? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is me and Rob sharing a moment... while we made some cookies. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What about me? I'm in the picture, too. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall, well, you're just observing us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I think this might have been Scott, drinking away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, Scott is pouring champagne in your mouth. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's trying to get me drunk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you got drunk. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I never... I haven't been drunk my entire life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, I was there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You've never been drunk? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: My turn? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go for it, Kendall. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall's turn. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: All right, this one is beautiful. Little Mase. Look at Mase. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mason was so little. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The next generation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mason was so armo back then. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, the other side of the room. What do we got? &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, this is our, uh... 234 00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:21,464 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my gosh, the leopard-lovin' family. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why would you guys ever make me wear a leopard top? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I think it was Khloe's top. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel bad for what they've done to you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, whatever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, these turn. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wanted to fit in, in the family, so I wanted to look as Middle-Eastern as possible. So that was this picture. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This looks like you guys just went to the prom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, yeah. In Glendale. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, guys, it's my turn. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is a picture of Bruce, Lam and Santa. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is really cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney when she broke up with Scott, so she was about 15 pounds underweight, and looking to impress. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And trying to hook up with Santa, get him drunk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. Even though he's a fake Santa. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And, then, this is Mom with Papa Harry and a guy that I have no idea who he is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's this guy named... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That you dated? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you sleep with him? You slept with him? &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's an animal! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, when Kendall and Kylie were little, and when you guys were little, we would make it look like Santa had eaten the milk and cookies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's so weird-- in normal households across the country, they let the real Santa eat the cookies. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Look. Daddy. Papa! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Santa ate his cookies! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, isn't that nice. You left cookies for him, huh? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And carrots. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Look at how early we woke up. It was, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys used to literally wake up at, like, 4:30 a.m. and wake all of us up. &gt;&gt; KIM: We would start Christmas at 6:00 a.m., no later. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hi, Kourt. Hi, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Daddy. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hi, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: I told Kourtney that we'll get a computer or video art, and I was right. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hey, look what Santa brought you. Look! What is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do not believe in Santa. &gt;&gt; KIM: I still believe in Santa. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I want to show you guys some videos, um, 280 00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:31,160 about Santa. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The same old Santa. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my gosh, who's with Santa? &gt;&gt; SANTA: My bells are ringing already. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He was a little inappropriate from time to time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa, Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is this gonna be on Access Hollywood? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that double-decker? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Double-decker bus. &gt;&gt; SANTA: My bells are ringing. I've seen Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What can I tell you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe Santa got lucky that night, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my goodness! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got to open your mouth. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can we do, like, one more gift, please? Who's number three? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I am. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ow! Come on, mate... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Either steal a gift or get a new one. Oh, it's heavy! &gt;&gt; ROB: ...it's a rock. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if it was a rock? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: A tent! : A tent. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A tent? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who would ever buy someone a tent? A hundred percent that's a Bruce gift. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, who's next? &gt;&gt; KIM: Who's number four? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm number four. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do you want the tent? Dad, do you want the tent? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want the tent? You could steal the tent. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You could take it... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, but if I take the tent, then I'm stuck with the tent. I'm going with the littlest one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Palm Beach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Palm Beach? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Palm Beach? &gt;&gt; KRIS: For sure that's from Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if it's from Kylie? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who bought this? It's a bracelet with "Wild" on it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who the heck would give that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that's got to be Rob! &gt;&gt; ROB: It is not from me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm stealing a gift, guys-- I'm scared. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm scared. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm pretty scared. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You should be scared. Today is our Christmas card shoot, and I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, you can bring 'em in. We're gonna do the reveal now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot wait to see what the set is gonna look like. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if it's from Kylie? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who the heck would give that? "Wild." It's a bracelet with "Wild" on it. Who bought this? &gt;&gt; ROB: It says "Wild"? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, no, no, it's says, "What would..." It's a "What would Jesus do" thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob! &gt;&gt; ROB: "WWJD" does not convert to "Wild." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it's me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who is number five? Five is Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Scott picked his fast. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you're not gonna take my bracelet? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott! That is so nasty and mean and-and disrespectful of Christmas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was mean. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kind of mean. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like I don't get enough scrutiny in this family, I open my gift wrong? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, he's Jewish, he didn't know about the nutcracker. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that's very cool. The Apple TV... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, that is such a good present. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is over a hundred dollars. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's from Kourtney. I can tell, 'cause look, she went like this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And then she's, like, yes, at least Scott got it. We can keep it in the family, and I'll return it when we get home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you're number six. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like anything that says "Naughty" on it. : It's a lightbulb. This is so exciting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Personal wireless lighting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've seen this in Kendall's room, and she just pushes a button on her iPhone and it changes all the colors in her room to any color she wants. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is like a light show. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is light-changing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think Kendall did this one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think this is Kenny's gift. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at Kenny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, so you guys know how when you guys were little kids, you always had matching outfits and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. We're not going into that, are we? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I just think that we've been so fashionable through the years, and I wanted to show you guys all the outfits that we've been wearing, and hairstyles, decade after decade. Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Merry Christmas. Sing a song for me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't sing when I'm pregnant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Those shoulder pads were like a football player's shoulder pads. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They were bigger than a football player. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aren't those shoulder pads coming back in? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Absolutely not. Look at Kourtney's outfit. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God! It looks like a portobello mushroom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When's dinnertime? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You hungry? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My God. &gt;&gt; KIM: This... is devastating. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I cannot watch that. Why would you do that to your kid? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. He hated her. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Come on, Kimberly, you look good. This is Christmas Eve.

Thank you. &gt;&gt; ROB: My dad's, like, "Beautiful, Khloe." Khloe, that's not funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you guys think that the sentimental gifts are the best gifts? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For sure. I don't think anyone's gotten me a sentimental gift. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, are you insane in the membrane? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got you two kids! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall's horse for Christmas was good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was, like, one of my favorite Christmases, watching her cry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just her crying and everything, it was so cute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go out in the driveway. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, Kendall, wait! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, that is so dope. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Merry Christmas, everybody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My favorite gift was when I got Harley the puppy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I remember that. &gt;&gt; KIM: How cute was that? That was the same year that Bruce got a real Harley. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's why I named my dog Harley, because you got a Harley-Davidson. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's Harley and Harley. dos! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Harley squared. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my gosh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: For Khloe! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's Khloe's dog! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh...! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh... &gt;&gt; KIM: How cute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, that's a good one. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I want a puppy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're getting Mase a puppy for Christmas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think next year. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come here. You can't open your eyes. Nobody say anything. Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, can I ride this! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My fat boy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your "fat boy"? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Play on it... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Barefoot. &gt;&gt; ROB: Is that the first Christmas that you were... that we were all together, that you spent with us? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It would be the first one after we got married, yes. Yeah, the first one... Christmas, we weren't married yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE &amp; KOURTNEY: You were living in sin! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know what that's like. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, baby! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I lived in sin for five and a half months. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wowzers! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm, like, five, six years in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim has lived in sin her entire life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You were such a great dad to these girls. &gt;&gt; ROB: He was a great dad to all of us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. I worked hard at it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But it doesn't mean you've never made any mistakes. Oh, honey, it's beautiful. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's a dope ring right there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it's so cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's way, way, way too small. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Mom! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, what a pain! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Christmas 1996, and Santa's been here, as you can see. &gt;&gt; KIM: So cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What'd you get, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Fuzzy coat and skirt and sweater. How dope. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You guys said "dope" back then? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She was before her time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, we made it up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was like "dope on a rope," that was, like, my phrase. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you got so far, Khloe? What is that, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, look, Barbie overalls. And Barbie even signed them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It says: "With love, Barbie." They get, like, designer clothes, and I get Barbie overalls that are, like, for a size 25, and I'm, like, "They're signed by Barbie!" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Go paint the house, kid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go scrub the floors, you little fella." &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, do you guys want to see, does anybody else have a favorite, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is our call. Hoo! Night owls! Kendall, hoo! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hoo! &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...emotional time... Okay, Kendall and Kylie, we're gonna go back to when you two were really small. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is Christmas 1998, Jenner style. Well, let's put it this way-- Kris style. And she does do a wonderful job, I have to admit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, you're such a host. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's Kylie Jenner. She's the cutest little thing. That's Kylie right there. Little nose is running, 'cause she always has a cold. I know, you want stuff over there. Oh, is it the baby's turn? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. There's the baby. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: The baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're the best. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did Santa come last night? Did Santa come? Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall Jenner, you got a car! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who is that in there? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kendall. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that Kendall? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, look at Kylie. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Look at Kylie. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, let's see you make a basket. Oh, come on, Kylie! Yay...! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you look like Penelope? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my gosh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're like P. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you girls having fun? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, that's not funny. No, wait, wait, you got to... you're gonna hit, you're gonna hit. Stop, stop, stop, stop! Hold it. Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's how Kylie drives now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I put makeup on by myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You put your makeup on by yourself? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm gonna go downstairs and-and... I'm gonna do more makeup, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at how cute you were back then-- &gt;&gt; KRIS: You were such a great dad to these girls. &gt;&gt; ROB: He was a great dad to all of us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All of us-- not just these girls. &gt;&gt; ROB: We got you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. I worked hard at it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All of you guys. But it doesn't mean you've never made any mistakes. &gt;&gt; ROB: Is that box number nine? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, it's beautiful. Is this the Christmas one? &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Doesn't say "Merry Christmas". This isn't the Christmas one. This is the 1998 one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, of course mom has to point that out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love this. Oh, honey, it's beautiful. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's a dope ring right there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, it's so cool. And way, way, way too small. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, what a pain. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that's a nice gift there! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, way, way, way too small. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I sound like, Kim. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wow! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, let's do seven. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm seven. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Number seven. Go, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to steal a gift? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm stealing a gift, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Or open a new one? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're stealing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm stealing a gift. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you want it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to know what gift I'm stealing? Who's scared? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm scared. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's scared? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm pretty scared, to be honest. &gt;&gt; ROB: She's grabbing my penis! Look at her. Look at her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you're such a bitch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's do a couple shots with the kids. &gt;&gt; MAN: I'm a safety freak. This wasn't a set built for kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's for our family 543 00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:03,285 Christmas card, and I want my kids to be in it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're stealing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm stealing a gift. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you want it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's scared? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm scared. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's scared? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm pretty scared, to be honest. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You should be scared. Give me the double-decker chin. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes! &gt;&gt; ALL: Oh! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, damn. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop! That was my life come true. So does that mean I have to pick a gift? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now you get to open up a gift. By the way, you guys, I just stole the gift that I bought. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Lucky for life lottery tickets". &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, get out of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, wow, what a good gift. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It says here that this is only worth ten dollars. So someone cheated. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think each one. This is ten. That's ten. In America, you add those. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, you do? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, here's ten, 20, 30. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine, fine, I don't feel so gypped. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just saying, the whole, you know, addition does work. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's you. &gt;&gt; KIM: That could come in handy for some other things. If you get lazy, it'll prop you up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, this is the best gift I've bought myself ever. I can not believe I... &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I see that thing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're not sharing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go, Kim, go. Go, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's stretching my skin, you guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Shut up. It's skin, it stretches. &gt;&gt; KIM: It stretches your skin. &gt;&gt; KIM: Open your mouth. Kim, you're supposed to open your mouth. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I'm not gonna do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, my neck is tired. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want that, and I'm pissed. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who's number eight? Rob, go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Number eight. Go for it, Rob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, do you want this with me? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What'd you get? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes. A helicopter. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who would ever buy that? &gt;&gt; ROB: This is perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll give you a hundred bucks, if in two weeks from now, you can kick that thing, take it off... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...fly it through a door, and then come back with it. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, this is, I'm good on this. I'll just keep this, and we'll just forget whatever bet you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I feel kind of bad for Rob, because he's the only boy. So I lumped all of your videos together, in the same little section so we can enjoy you 150%. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, this has got to be good. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What Robert? What is it? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, can I open it? Can I open it? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Sure you can. &gt;&gt; ROB: Can I open this? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Sure. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hello! Watch me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's Rob. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: "Hello, watch me"? What is it Rob? This is the exact one I wanted. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know. Santa's good, I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You were so cute, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: I know. No tattoos. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The sweet, innocent little Rob. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Before you spent time in jail. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What I thought was interesting, Rob, about that video, was you're over there going, "look at me, look at me, look at me." The guys in this family have always had a hard time trying to get, our, you know, a little attention. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's all about us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love the fact that when you guys were little, you always had those electric cars. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got a car for Christmas, one year, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's a little collection of you guys and your family cars. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love when you make that QVC face. "Family cars." &gt;&gt; ROB: Want to ride in my car? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hey, hey, hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe and Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: We're chilling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I'm holding him. Look how nice I am. Lookit... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Look, she's grabbing my penis. Look at her. Kim, you're such a bitch. She's pushing him away. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're a sicko. I won't stop freaking out. Look at Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ghost ride the wind, man. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh! Ghost riding the wind. &gt;&gt; ROB: Who does that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fire! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Take it easy. You're running over the other cars. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim was in the Mercedes having somebody push her car for her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm surprised she wasn't sitting in the back seat of it, and having someone drive her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, so I know you guys always make fun of me for being so emotional. So look at some of these videos of how mushy I can really be. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw, the musha. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This was so nice. 645 00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:29,584 Is it really a watch? Look at this. Oh, I love this. I love this. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is it? What is that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just this rack to hang the pots and pans from. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A pots and pans rack. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really... Stop. I'm embarrassed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't believe you cried over the pots and pans. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There weren't even pots and pans. It was the rack that the pots and pans hung on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really wanted that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm convinced you're an actress. There's no way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: See how nice she was then? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You were so sweet then. What happened? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I won $10,000. Give it to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I am the one that got you this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't care. 665 00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:21,202 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It stays in the family. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He fell asleep during your little... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You fell asleep. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you just take a nap, and we'll watch the rest? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. '91, Christmas. It's a pretty dress, huh? Isn't that pretty? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love that dress. That's the hot dress. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Say "Hi, Daddy." Oh... and there's your beautiful elf mommy. When will Santa be here? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, I'm thinking in like, about six hours. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No, more than that. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: All right! &gt;&gt; KIM: We had one hot mom. No, seriously, that's what I want to be. Like, how she like, jumped in, and she had all these kids, and they were so cute running around, and she looked so hot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But even with, like, her apron on, I thought she looked so hot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney. She is playing the lottery already, and we're not done. How do you know if someone doesn't want your gift? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They might, but I'm saying... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They're going to definitely want it if she wins. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, but you're gonna know if someone... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, see if you win first. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is kind of addicting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How did she get a quarter, all of a sudden? &gt;&gt; KIM: I still have to do mine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's do that. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I'm gonna swap. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't swap it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall, I don't want yours. But Scott... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You-you are not... &gt;&gt; KIM: I do want yours. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you joking? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're the richest person here. Why do you got to take my electronics? &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott, this one is mine that I personally got, and I know you will like it. You might. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, do I open this now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited. Apple TV. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, you could buy like, every kid's movie on there, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, good. But wait, I could... I hook it up to the TV, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's why it's called Apple TV. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh! You got me a rub and tug? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, I did. I actually should've kept that for myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A good gift certificate. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Gift card to Four Seasons. &gt;&gt; KIM: For a massage. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look, I won $10,000. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? It has to go that way. Match three like amounts. I won $10,000. You guys, I won. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She won $10,000 on a lottery ticket. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I won $10,000. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She won $10,000 on a lottery ticket! &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It just says "match three." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me see. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, let the momager see. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do I get ten percent? &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Winning prizes of one dollar, five dollar, $25 and $50 may be claimed wherever lottery tickets are sold. Winning tickets, oh, of a $100 or more must be sent by mail, to the money fairy." "123 Nowhere Drive, in Make-Believe Land". &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, are you listening? &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Valid only in your dreams." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is so mean. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "This ticket is for entertainment purposes only." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, we are in the entertainment business. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're so cheap. That's so mean. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, you guys. Well, would you guys pay attention? Even when you know they're fake, you're gonna still play with them? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Her boobs are fake, and I still play with those. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can not do that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to talk to you guys about all the people that have been in our lives through the years that aren't here anymore, and I think that we should give them a little respect and a bit of love. So look at this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here's my dad in April, 1992. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, surround your daddy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh! Oh! Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney! &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. Who's the father of these love... Oh, my God, that is so cute. Right here, right here, right here, Robert. Robert. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's my Sweet 16, guys. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm thankful for my children. Especially Kimberly, I'm thankful for. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoo-hoo... I'm his favorite, too. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm just thankful for everybody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm tellin' you here. Harry just finally got up. &gt;&gt; HARRY: Got up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Early to sleep, and late to rise. &gt;&gt; HARRY: That's right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My gosh. &gt;&gt; ROB: He's tease... Bruce, you're teasing him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Merry Christmas. I like your sweatshirt. I like your sweatshirt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at your dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, right. Dad drives the bike. &gt;&gt; WILLIAM: ...and a priest by night, huh? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He was such a nice guy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Too bad, especially Kendall and Kylie, you know, he passed away really before you guys were very big. It's too bad that you didn't really get to know him that much. You know? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: So what do you want for Christmas? &gt;&gt; NANA: I'm trying to... I'm trying to get my pilaf back in shape. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah, I smell its burn. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Papa, what do you want for Christmas? &gt;&gt; PAPA: I want my people to be happy and make a lot of money. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Well, they already are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She just loves Papa. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Papa! Papa, Papa... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Merry Christmas, Papa. &gt;&gt; PAPA: Merry Christmas, Kimberly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not Kimberly. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. That was the best. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney-- "I'm not Kimberly." So, like, calm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, you guys. There's so many special things about the holidays. And just watching all these videos really reminds me how blessed I am. And, you know, what makes it so amazing is you guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We see my kids-- very, very young age. But now we're starting the next generation. And we make Christmas special for them. And, kind of, life goes on. And I'm very proud of everybody. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm just super thankful that I get to have all of you guys around me, and have such a big family. And that we're all so involved with each other. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you guys. &gt;&gt; ROB: I love you guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Love is in the air. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, so who wants to open their stocking? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who doesn't? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? Come on. This is for Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is Kourtney. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. I got the new comb that just came out? &gt;&gt; ROB: Ooh... Slim Jim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Godiva chocolates. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can always use golf balls. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Break yourself! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my goodness. Santa likes me the best. I got some panties. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, guys. Well, for everybody who didn't think any of my children were talented, check this out. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: ♫ Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way... ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at your girlfriend. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: ♫ Oh what fun... ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney's playing it. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: ♫ It is to ride ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's Kourtney Kardashian. Kourtney... &gt;&gt; GIRLS: ♫ In a one-horse open sleigh... ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Merry Christmas, everybody! &gt;&gt; ROB: Bruce, you want a Slim Jim? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow, this is actually 828 00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,580 pretty good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. We need to make sure we don't have a double chin. Our Christmas presents are coming up... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, we all have to use this. The fact that I stole this from you... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, stop taking it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You really were scammed. First, I jacked this from you. And then you got the lotto tickets that were all fake. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was, like, the best. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KIM: But, like, who are... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but she was scammed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but, how-how excited was I when I won $10,000? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was so sad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you know it was a scam? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, guys, so stay tuned, because we're going to show you everything from our Christmas card shoot with David LaChapelle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yep. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who else needs a little work on their chin? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Go for it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Give it to Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm not going to use it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, why not? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because you guys have, like, germs. I need, like, a... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What a "beach." My butt is shoved in here so tightly. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Can you lay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't literally, like, move in this. 859 00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,544 &gt;&gt; DAVID: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just wrecked. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't believe it's Christmastime already. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's always Christmas around our house, Scott. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I don't need anything, but, you know, we were... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my... You broke the custom-made chair? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just broke the chair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You just broke the chair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, get your together! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll get... I'll get blamed for it. No, I just want everybody to know. You know, 'cause it's Christmastime. We're seeing all the stuff in the stupid tabloids, and... &gt;&gt; ALL: No! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sorry. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You did it wrong. Sorry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You never say the word "tabloid"... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...as long as you live. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This has been a crazy year. Kim and Kanye got engaged and just had a baby. Khloe and Lamar have been having some issues. And because my mom and Bruce are now separated, we just need to figure out what Christmas is gonna be like. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that you guys need to know that it's always going to be the same. Like, you guys never have to worry that we're not gonna have a holiday together. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nothing has changed. We're still family. The relationship has changed, and this, and that... It doesn't make any difference. &gt;&gt; KIM: Since my mom and Bruce have come to the realization that they want to be separated, they get along just so much better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't wait until Christmas Eve. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Being that over the top, because it's a Kris Jenner party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's been so many changes within our family over the past few months. But Bruce is still our dad. He's been in our lives for 25 years. And I'm very relieved that Bruce is gonna be just as involved in our traditions as he's always been. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Family will always be first. The whole holiday season is... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. Let's discuss. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY :So, on Christmas Eve, are you gonna sleep over? Or do you go home... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's my Christmas present. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and come back in the morning? 906 00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:47,294 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, get excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look how old you looked. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was 14. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 14? Kim is hoochin' it up. Those were the good old days. We've been doing our Christmas cards for... as long as I can remember. That was Kourtney and Kim's best look. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. It was mine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Through any big obstacle in our family, this is something that we've never broken. And we've never missed a year. It's the biggest tradition, I would say, within our family. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This was Kendall's worst card. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't it funny that someone with the worst smile ended up having the best and being a model? 'Member, she didn't know how? You'd be like "Smile," she'd go... Our good friend and photographer, Nick Saglimbeni, has always taken our Christmas card photos. We've always loved the photos that Nick has taken for us. 927 00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,450 But we're just gonna change it up a little bit this year. David LaChapelle's a photographer I've always wanted to work with. His vibe of how he makes these, like, wild themes. It is like you've stepped into a movie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KIM: We're looking at, like, old photos, so that we can come to this meeting with a couple ideas. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is our theme for this year? Like, what do you want? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, why don't we talk to the photographer, and not have a preconceived notion of what we want to do. You know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We want to have input too, 'cause... &gt;&gt; KRIS:Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...it's so personal and sentimental. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I think that, you know, he has such a strong vision that we just have to go with the flow. I mean, obviously, if it's something that we don't like, it's our card. We won't use it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sure he'll have amazing ideas. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Getting David LaChapelle to photograph our Christmas card is huge for us. He has his photographs in museums and galleries all over the world. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm excited. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have a real serious question to ask all of you. I leave tomorrow morning... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do I get my nails done tonight? I need my cuticles cut. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is your big, serious question? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. Seriously, I can't stop thinking about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that's it? Oh! &gt;&gt; DAVID: Hey, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; DAVID: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Good to see you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you so much for coming. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I'm Khloe. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I'm David. Nice to meet you. This is Robert. &gt;&gt; TAYLOR: Hi, I'm Robert. How you doin'? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, nice to meet you. You guys smell so good. Who knew? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Yeah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so excited to meet David LaChapelle. My only concern is that I just have seen a lot of of his work where most people are nude. He does them in an artistic way, but this is still a Christmas card shoot, so I just hope that this is, like, a PG version. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Over the years, we've done these family Christmas cards. &gt;&gt; KIM: Should we show...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, go get it. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I've seen them. I've seen them. This'll be a little different from that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good, good. &gt;&gt; DAVID: It's not gonna be Christmassy. It'll-it'll have... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're not gonna be wearing hats with red balls? &gt;&gt; DAVID: No, no, no, no, no. It's not gonna be, like, red and green or anything... ...like that, but it will definitely be something really unexpected. It's almost like opening this surprise... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you ideas? 'Cause you have such crazy, amazing ideas. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Yeah, I love taking higher art and sort of mixing it with contemporary pop culture and, you know, I want to make it visually just interesting and beautiful and then you get drawn in, but on a deeper level, it says something about the time and place where we live, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I... You know, I am not this artsy-fartsy brain. I really don't know what he's talking about in this meeting. &gt;&gt; DAVID: You know, like, it'll be an experience, for sure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But what I did take from this is that this is not your typical Christmas card. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Well, I started with this idea... There's, like, this futuristic kind of messy world... You guys are behind these windows and there's a street outside. Wind keeps blowing and there's a lot of electricity, there's a lot of smoke, there's water... &gt;&gt; TAYLOR: It'll be like an action film set. &gt;&gt; DAVID: It's an action film set. &gt;&gt; TAYLOR: Literally. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Almost on fire. And there's gonna be an upside-down vehicle on the road, like, spun out, and... it's nuts. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What about my kids? &gt;&gt; DAVID: When you add the kids, it becomes a little bit more complicated. The lights and the cords... You know, it's just gonna add a level of stress and I won't be able to focus. And maybe it's better to leave, um, the kids out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: David would feel more comfortable shooting if my kids weren't in the Christmas card. But I really think my kids should be a part of it. &gt;&gt; DAVID: It'd be cool with just you girls. You represent the matriarchs of the family, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DAVID: It's the women. &gt;&gt; KIM: I actually really liked his idea of having it just the girls. Considering what's going on in the family, I think it would just be easy to show up like a regular photo shoot. Kanye's on tour, Lamar, um, is busy. Um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's a lot of moving parts in our family right now. So when David suggests just doing the Christmas card with the girls, it seems to be a pretty good idea. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Then there's none of that, um, guessing game, you know, "Where's so and so?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's interesting, too, because there's a lot of anticipation for this Christmas card every year. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Oh, yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like, "What's the theme? Who's gonna leak it?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And my mom just whores us out to all the press, so it gets picked up everywhere. So, you know, you'll be so excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're twisted, 1037 00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:16,323 you're twisted. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on in! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh! &gt;&gt; KIM: Whee-pee! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've had too much sugar! Never making a gingerbread house with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! Leave me alone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is anyone else confused about what our Christmas card theme is this year? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What's the deal with it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's kind of no guys. So it's just us girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Visually speaking, it would be better without the guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This bitch is tripping, boo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob is just not feeling his best right now. physically, so he doesn't want to be in the Christmas card. Kanye is gonna be on tour, so, you know, we want to talk to Scott and see how Scott's feeling about not being in the Christmas card. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob does not want to be in it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Neither do I, frankly. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I do feel bad, though, 'cause I want Dad to be a part of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do, too, and I think he should be. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I think, like, there's too many changes already. We can't have that much shock therapy. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And Christmas cards are about family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Exac-a-ta-ly. The last one on our list to see if he wants to be in our Christmas card is Bruce. And you know, we haven't really talked to him about this yet. Does he want to be in it? Does he not care? Should this be an all-girl shoot? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No kids, too? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You want your kids in your card 'cause I look back at our past Christmas cards to see me as, like, a kid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The cards, and that's what stands out, too, is the kids. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know David LaChapelle is an artist and he has a strong vision of what he wants this photograph to be like, but it's still our family Christmas card, and I want my kids to be in it, so they will be in it. I'm, like, excited about the high concept of it, so let's just all be open-minded. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is anybody thinking about a Hanukkah card? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here you go! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good girl. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She misses me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why don't you take her with you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not at the house very much. I'm always running around, you know? All right! Ready? Go! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Have you heard about the Christmas card? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What about the Christmas card? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Since Lamar and Kanye can't do it and Scott and Rob don't care, I think it's just gonna be the girls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well... first of all, I think that is a terrible decision. Whose idea is this? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. I think the photographer. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it's not the photographer. My God, he'll shoot anything. It's not his decision on how my Christmas card goes. It's not the girls' Christmas card. It's our family Christmas card. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I agree. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We've done it for 23 years. And now, all of a sudden, they want to change it? You know, maybe Mom and I, our relationship is a little different, but we're still married and we're still a family and all that kind of stuff, so... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I agree. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, it's just, it's your mom's and my Christmas card. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I heard that your feelings were hurt. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've never in the past had to be invited to our Christmas card. &gt;&gt; KIM: My understanding was just the two kids were gonna come at the end. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kourtney's kid. &gt;&gt; DAVID: There can't be kids running around. 1110 00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:33,387 There's glass. It's not gonna work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what pisses me off? Is that those windows are not tinted, and when we shower... Wasn't there a paparazzi over there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They can take pictures right in there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Guys, that's not the bathroom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is the bathroom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's the bedroom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's the bedroom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, then it doesn't bother me as much. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, Kendall told us that Bruce is upset. &gt;&gt; KIM: "It's your mom and my Christmas card for over 20 years." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He goes, "Yeah, of course. Why would I not want to be in it?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For Bruce to go and tell Kendall that he wants to be in this, I think she's expecting him to be in it. Kendall called me saying that she's really upset because Bruce is really upset that he wasn't asked to be in the Christmas card. I feel really bad because we just haven't had the chance to ask him yet. We were kind of making our rounds with all the guys. So now we kinda have to do damage control. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't realize that he felt this way at all. The last thing I want to do is hurt anybody's feelings, and I don't want to make Kendall and Kylie feel bad. And the "No guys" theme is just something that I felt like maybe it was something to go with when the photographer suggested it, because it keeps it so clean. There's so much drama going on in our family right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know my mom is trying to protest everybody else's feelings, but I feel like it's doing the complete opposite. It's turning into a stressful train wreck that I don't want to happen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just really want to explain my whole thought process to Bruce so he doesn't have his feelings hurt. This will always be our family. And I want our family to be happy. Let's just fix it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I ask you a question? Who's thisguy in you backyard? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's called the pool man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who cleans at this hour? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's my new boyfriend. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, what a shocker. Now what brings you all the way up here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I heard that your feelings were hurt because we 1157 00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:55,095 didn't invite you to be in the Christmas card shoot. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Christmas is about family. With this Christmas card and just the girls doing it, first of all, I think it's a stupid idea; it's not just about the girls. But somebody would have at least communicated with me. And the person that should have done that was Kris. I've never in the past had to be invited to our Christmas card. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think what you have to realize is we had the opportunity to work with this really great photographer. He said, "Why don't we just do no kids and all girls?" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But then it's not a Christmas card. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just kind of the way that it was evolving. It wasn't a diss on you or anybody else. I just want you to know that I'm really sorry, and I want you to be in the Christmas card if you want to be in the Christmas card. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I appreciate you telling me that; kind of what went down. I'm in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm really glad that Bruce and I are able to communicate, and that's why we're gonna have an amazing relationship. We're best friends. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So what's our theme? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's nothing traditional. It's wild, with wild clothes, crazy hair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My hair's long enough now. I can go crazy hair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Out and everything. It'd be great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, you do that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get your hairbrush out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And come on over to the Christmas card shoot, okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. I'll be there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The more the merrier. 1189 00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:13,740 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Merry Christmas. Ho-ho-ho. &gt;&gt; JOHNNY WUJEK: Hey, hot stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; JOHNNY: We got some bangin' looks. It's kind of like this kind of '60s glam. Just super chic. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're at our wardrobe fitting for our Christmas card shoot with Johnny Wujek, who is Katy Perry's stylist. I love that. &gt;&gt; JOHNNY: This is amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: He is super creative, and I am so excited to see all of these clothes. &gt;&gt; JOHNNY: Hey, D. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Hey, guy. Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! &gt;&gt; DAVID: Hey. Good. How you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; JOHNNY: This is pretty sexy, hot vixen. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I like it. &gt;&gt; JOHNNY: Love it. Everybody, look here. &gt;&gt; KIM: The clothes are, like, outrageous. The whole theme just is so perfect for what we want to do, and kind of step outside the box. Love it. &gt;&gt; DAVID: This is exactly what I wanted. Still, seeing you blonde, it's really hard to get used to. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. It's weird for me. I only look good when I have makeup on with blonde hair. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Can we spray it black for the shoot? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I kind of want blonde hair. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I'm thinking we'll go with the classic black-haired beauty 'cause you're gonna go black eventually. I know that 'cause I'm psychic. &gt;&gt; KIM: But not for a while. I'm gonna stick this one through. I'm gonna get a spray tan the night before, and I'm gonna be a golden goddess. &gt;&gt; JOHNNY: You're killing him right now. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey, Dad. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I'm so glad you're doing this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. They finally let me in. It was a battle, but I got in. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Bruce, I'm really good with that. Can you put your arms out to the side? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're still 17, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Only for three days, Dad. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I wish I had all these dresses in my closet. &gt;&gt; DAVID: High heels are dope with that shoe. &gt;&gt; JOHNNY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DAVID: That's the one. Wait-- did your hair go lighter, too? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My hair's been light. Everyone just jumped on my bandwagon. &gt;&gt; JOHNNY: Yeah. This is bangin', though &gt;&gt; DAVID: Oh, my God. Turn around. Jesus. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney's sick right now, so she, we're pulling for her, so we pulled, like, the lace pieces, all the glam. And she's the easiest, clothes-wise. Um, the kids. My understanding was just the two kids were gonna come at the end. &gt;&gt; JOHNNY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And get in a couple shots? &gt;&gt; DAVID: I wasn't told... I don't know anything about kids. &gt;&gt; JOHNNY: Yeah, the little, um, Kourtney's kids. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Nobody told me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney... &gt;&gt; DAVID: But wait a minute. But there's, like, fire and all kind... We talked about that at the meeting, Like, I mean, kids is just... There can't be kids running around. Like, seriously, there's glass. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think she was gonna, like, just try at the end, have them brought in. &gt;&gt; DAVID: In the group photo? 1253 00:53:55,568 --> 00:53:58,605 &gt;&gt; KIM: I think so. &gt;&gt; DAVID: It's not gonna work. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Today is our Christmas card shoot. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Beautiful! Right there! Don't move! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now I have the perfect opportunity just to let David know that I am gonna have my kids in the Christmas card. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Oh, my God, there's children here! I don't have a place to put 'em. &gt;&gt; MAN: Have you guys seen how amazing the set looks? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They won't let us see until... &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh, you're gonna gag. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really? &gt;&gt; MAN: It's so unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today is the day of our Christmas card shoot, and David is insisting that we can't see the set. He wants it to be this big surprise. Hi! &gt;&gt; DAVID: How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We heard the set is incredible. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just cannot wait to see the set. I am going to have the kids come in towards the end of the photo shoot, so we can get rid of anything hazardous or dangerous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I actually like this. Somebody flew that headpiece all the way from Paris. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you look like a Christmas ornament. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is... I am a Christmas ornament. You can hang me on the tree. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's incredibly hands-on and has a very specific vision for hair and makeup. It's insane. Only you could wear something like that, Kourt. Because you have a small head. My head is way too big. 1282 00:55:21,254 --> 00:55:24,390 That's why I wear wigs on wigs on wigs. My butt is shoved in here so tightly. How do you look so normal, and I have to look like this? &gt;&gt; DAVID: I think you should have a slit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How high do you want it? &gt;&gt; DAVID: As high as-as you feel comfortable. I mean, I-I would like it... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; DAVID: I am really into slit. Where does it go-- here? &gt;&gt; JOHNNY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I haven't had this much action in months. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does anyone think that it's odd? &gt;&gt; MAKEUP ARTIST: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That he thinks my hair should be bigger? &gt;&gt; MAKEUP ARTIST: No, it's... You got to be larger than life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, look at my hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, did you... do you see how big my hair is right now? &gt;&gt; MAKEUP ARTIST: Have you seen David LaChapelle's pictures? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, you look so cute! I can't move my arms. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sorry. We're not waiting on Kim, are we? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Kim's hair is like... You're giving me nothing. I wantsex machine! It just looks so normal. &gt;&gt; KIM: Would you rather it out? &gt;&gt; DAVID: I want to bring it up. &gt;&gt; KIM: David is really unhappy with my hair, and I thought it looked great, but obviously David knows what he's doing, and, you know, I just have to trust his vision. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Everyone's got these beautiful hairdos and Kim shows up with this kind of like... &gt;&gt; HAIRDRESSER: Yeah, but you didn't see... &gt;&gt; DAVID: It's pretty. You got to do something major. You got to reallyit up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are these people? &gt;&gt; DAVID: It needs an edge. Yeah, here we go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really can't go down there, though. I mean, Gorgerella! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kim, we have a first. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your hair is bigger than your ass. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: From the back. &gt;&gt; MAN: So, we're gonna do the reveal now. Is everybody good? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so dramatic. I love it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I cannot wait to see what the set is gonna look like. He is known for his elaborate, crazy sets. &gt;&gt; MAN: You guys ready? In three, two, one. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. This is amazing! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. This set is insane. Oh, geez! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is amazing! David LaChapelle has created a post-apocalyptic, futuristic world. It's very pop culture-- the 1331 00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:55,441 Olympics, the tabloids. I am just blown away. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is so insane. I can't believe he hand-sketched and stenciled in all of these images of us. It is so intense, and I can't wait to shoot. &gt;&gt; DAVID: So, we ready, guys? Let's get everybody in their spots. Kim, on the stairs. Kris, you're here. You're gonna be lounging here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who? &gt;&gt; DAVID: You, you're like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't literally, like, move in this. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Okay, can you lay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How-how do you want me to lay? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Basically just like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me... I could try. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kind of like you're letting her freefall, but catching her. 1347 00:58:35,214 --> 00:58:39,619 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just ripped. &gt;&gt; DAVID: That's okay. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mom! Mommy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey! I am so happy to see my children. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mom! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi! I love looking at our past Christmas cards, and just seeing how we grow every year and change. It's really important to me to have my kids in the Christmas card. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Look straight at me. Straight at me. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mommy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; MASON: I don't like your hair. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; DAVID: They're mostly down like that, huh? &gt;&gt; MASON: You're crazy. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Mm-hmm. Oh, my God, there's children. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason? &gt;&gt; MASON: Mom! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, do you want to come with me to look at your clothes? You guys are gonna get dressed. &gt;&gt; MASON: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Where should I put the kids? &gt;&gt; DAVID: I'm not putting kids. 1368 00:59:31,938 --> 00:59:34,774 I don't... I don't have a place to put them. Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH &gt;&gt; MASON: Mom! &gt;&gt; DAVID: Oh, my God, there's children. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys are gonna get dressed. You want to look at your clothes that you're gonna wear? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Where should I put the kids? &gt;&gt; DAVID: They're toddlers, like, they're babies. I don't have a place to put them. Kourtney, I guess there was, like, a lot of confusion about the kids coming. I don't know... like, I didn't plan on the... the kids being shot, I didn't make it for the set. I'm really scared of toddlers being here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, it's a Christmas card. If we want this to be our Christmas card, then I think we want them in the shoot, 'cause I think that's what people care to look at is, like, the kids over the years. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I get that, I just didn't baby-proof the set. Like, I'm a, I'm a safety freak. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: David LaChapelle is still worried about the safety issues but I feel, like, everything will be perfectly safe for them, and so I feel really comfortable with having them in the shoot. &gt;&gt; DAVID: There's glass. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The glass is nowhere around here. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I'm just not comfortable... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Penelope I would be holding. Mason could even be sitting next to Khloe. I think we should do a-- if you're okay with it-- couple shots with them in it. I promise they'll be fine. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're not gonna start running around. Could we just not have the fire on while they're in here? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Okay, I don't want to, like, ruin the Christmas card. I don't want to be the Grinch that stole Christmas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are. I'm just kidding. Let's just do a couple shots, and see how it goes. &gt;&gt; DAVID: You guys are really used to getting your own way, aren't you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No! &gt;&gt; DAVID: One's a toddler, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason, he's almost four-- here he is. He's the most handsome boy in the world. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here, you're gonna have to be... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Oh, my God. He's in a tux. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here, why don't you sit right here? &gt;&gt; MASON: Mousey, mousey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not real. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Ready, guys? Here we go. Lights. We'll start right here. Energy! Here we go. Beautiful, right here. Good. Just go for it. Hold it, please. A little more light on Kylie. Good, beautiful. Look for those lights. Long neck! Beautiful! Right there. Don't move! &gt;&gt; KIM: When David LaChapelle says that he wants this photo shoot to be an experience, he was not lying. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Face toward me, Bruce! Bruce! There, there, there, no, no, there! &gt;&gt; KIM: It is so crazy, there is so much going on. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Look at the light. Yes, good! Mason, look over here. Look at your mom. Beautiful. Wow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is truly a once in a lifetime experience. And to do this with my kids, I really couldn't imagine it any other way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She doesn't like the headband. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Right here. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's such an amazing day today. It's been the best experience all the way around. And the icing on the cake is that Bruce is here, so I cannot wait to see the finished photo. It's a wrap! &gt;&gt; DAVID: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you so much. It's gonna be amazing. The Christmas card grows two sizes at the end. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I don't want to be... 1443 01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:41,427 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! Boop. Oh! This is so heavy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That doesn't go on this tree, actually. &gt;&gt; KIM: That shoot was so much fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I had so much fun. It was doing something out of the box, Chapelle was phenomenal, just the whole, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Amazing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What an experience. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! I was just searching for that word. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You were searching high and low. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: High and low. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys were the ones that were so crazy about the Christmas card. I knew it was gonna turn out amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shh! Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're controlling, and you are, too. But, you know, being a little controlling-- ooh-- never hurt anyone. I feel really blessed that we all love and cherish traditions like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And we hope that everyone has a merry Christmas and happy holidays. &gt;&gt; KIM: Now, the moment everyone's been waiting for-- here's our Christmas card 2013. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Merry Christmas! Are you leaving me, too? Keeping Up with the Kardashians... This is gonna be Kanye's music studio. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to learn to rap. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It won't be ready till they say about June. That's a year! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim has been doing her makeup in my bathroom for about three hours. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, it's Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, it's Kris Jenner, and I want to talk to somebody really loud because my daughter's taking all of her calls here like this is her office... We're better as friends than we are the other way. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So then why are you still married? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Our feelings are our feelings. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Khloe! &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZO: Did you do this to Lamar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been in hiding because I'm afraid of people. I have major anxiety. 1481 01:04:25,097 --> 01:04:29,568 I have to move on with my life, and that means changing a lot. &gt;&gt; BRODY: How is Lamar? Poor guy. Poor you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I would do anything to get accepted back by you guys. You guys are all I got. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are a ride or die family-- no matter what happens, we're always here to support you. We can't control other people. All we can control is ourselves. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Family united. I agree. Let it out, sister. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's bringing sexy back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Our family has never 1493 01:04:59,432 --> 01:05:02,568 been stronger. And nothing will tear us apart. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're having a wedding, everybody!
