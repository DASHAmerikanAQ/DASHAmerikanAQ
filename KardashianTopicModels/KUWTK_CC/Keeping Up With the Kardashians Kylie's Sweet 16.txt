- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is Lamar coming to my party? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, God only knows. Lamar is a very depressed person which is sad but understandable for everything he's been through in his life. &gt;&gt; ROB: What happened with the security camera? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He wants me to watch them right now. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why, to show you what he's doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't, I don't... : I don't know what's happening. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's so much going on at the Odom household that nobody really understands, nor should they at this point. I just happen to live there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, um, now he is, um, M.I.A.? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one in my family but Rob really knows what's going on with Lamar. 17 00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,275 And it's really scary when someone's in such a deep low. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know what I've been thinking about? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Biodegradable foods. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Organic vegetables. Moving to a farm changing your name. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Anything else? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mostly all that. But I was thinking it's so weird that Lamar's never been to our house. I do find it odd that Lamar doesn't like to hang out for whatever reason and I feel like we are not as close as before. Do you find it odd? Me, you, Khloe and Lamar, have never gone out to dinner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Obviously. They, you can't make plans with them. Me and Lamar were supposed to hang out the other day. He called me, he's like, "Yo, no matter what goes down, me and you are getting up tomorrow. We are chilling all day." Next day I never heard from him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna call her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like they live in, like, North California. And they live ten minutes down the road. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Do you guys want to go out to dinner tonight? Me, you, and Lamar and Scott? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, where would you like to go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's go to Kushiyu, it's right down the street from you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, you've been to that sushi restaurant, Kushiyu. Remember, you liked that joint? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't remember. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He doesn't remember. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What time? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm, whatever time you want, Princess Diana. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 6:30? Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, is that, is that acceptable? Can you still go to dinner? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I don't get why you're being such a bitch all of a sudden. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not, I want to come over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fine, well, we never prevent you from coming over here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, dudette. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, are we really gonna go to sushi tonight, though? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I had plans with Malika, but if we go earlier... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So why did you tell us that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure she won't care if I move it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, dinner tonight? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's talk when you guys get here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, such a joke at this point. Every time we try to make plans with Khloe and Lamar they always fall through. It's just so confusing, I don't know what's going on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, it'll never happen. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, we'll see you at 6:30? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What a freak. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She will not hang out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How do I get over? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, go, go, go. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can I take... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, go, go, go. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can I take a right here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you're gonna go. You're gonna go. Quicker, quicker. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, you want me to go fast. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go faster. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go faster, go fast... Oh... Kylie... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, we're good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a tricky... Okay, stay in this lane. For real, God, I think you're 78 00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,539 gonna give me a heart attack. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Geez. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This feels like home. Hi, everybody. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, come on in. Let's tell Sharon all of your great ideas for a sweet 16. So, Kylie's personality is edgy and fun. She's really adventurous. I was even thinking we could all go on a train. Like, rent a train? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, go-carting? We take over the whole place? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Or go to Disneyland, and... &gt;&gt; SHARON: Do you like that? No, okay, you're not into it... KYLIE: I don't want to, like, ride rides or anything like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't want to ride rides and play games? Like, it doesn't get any better than that. KYLIE: My mom throws a lot of parties, and she's great at it. But I really want this to be my organic thoughts, and all... me. I've just dreamed, like, ever since I was little, of doing... I've never had a party, but doing an Alice in Wonderland theme. &gt;&gt; SHARON: There's a building, it's downtown. The top floor, it's not open, windows. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; SHARON: You got, like, a 360 degree view of the city. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; SHARON: And it's a very awesome place. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's really cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you do a New York club. A club scene. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Maybe Kendall wouldn't mind my mom deciding every detail of her sweet 16, but I am definitely not okay with where this is going. I kind of want her to take two steps back. I got this under control. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What if we did a Moulin Rouge party? I could wear a garter belt. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's very Dolce &amp; Gabbana meets Twisted Sister. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It would be nice if this back yard ever got done. &gt;&gt; ROB: What happened in the...? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah... It ain't there now, though, it ain't nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How's it hanging? &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, mine's a little... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How do you feel about our new rosemary out here? &gt;&gt; ROB: I like the, um, the vanilla smell better. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you guys gonna talk like this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause I can't. &gt;&gt; ROB: All day, all day, all... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yup, all day every day in the rut. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you find it so odd, you know, Lamar has never been here. &gt;&gt; ROB: You kind of got to go through Khloe. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We tried, and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What, to make plans? &gt;&gt; ROB: Just, scheduling, period, with him. What, are you trying to hang out with him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel, like, a connection to him. 'Cause he's, you know, married to my sister. But I don't know what goes on in that house with all you three. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nobody does. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would totally reach out to Lamar and see what's going on, but I feel like we don't really have that relationship. And there's just always, like, weird stuff going on at the house. They kind of live in their own world and... I don't know. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, to be honest, we kind of all do our own thing. Like, I, sometimes, never will see him or Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. You just got to set up, uh, "Let's go... dinner, let's go watch a movie at the house, let's... go to Mexico, let's..." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just, like, want to get to know him better. What if I just hop in the house when I know he's gonna be there? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You could pop off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Instead of make plans? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, that's the best way. Just message me and I'll let you know, you just tell me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and then it gets awkward. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what to do. Kylie's a fricking hoarder. I mean, 75 pairs of pajamas. &gt;&gt; JACLYN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And what else did you find? &gt;&gt; JACLYN: About 42 cell phone cases. &gt;&gt; MAN: Does she know you're doing all this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; JACLYN: No, she's gonna die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie is 16 years old and she's got to learn to be neat and tidy. So I figure I could help her out a little. I feel like all that crap in there is just getting into her lungs. Gah! This isn't even touching her closet, I mean... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Did you do this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have no idea what's going on in here. These are all things she hasn't looked at, Kendall, in a year. You should've seen what we found under her bed. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's gonna murder you. I know my mom has issues with seeing us grow up and kind of becoming women. So I feel like that's maybe the reason why she's just randomly freaking out about nothing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think what we're gonna do is she doesn't get a 170 00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,560 driver's license until she gets it all organized. Hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What's up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, how are you? Hi, guys. How are you? Okay, wait. I have to tell you something. And I don't want you to get mad at me... for real. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Did you go through my room? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, here's the thing. I was gonna surprise you... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's all my new clothes, so if you touch them, I swear to God... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, well, wait, 'cause I love you. Hold on, hold on, come here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie? Kylie. I didn't touch anything, and I didn't throw anything away. That's the good news. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just came home from a trip, so no one's coming in my room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but wait, hold on. space. I'm not six years old. I don't need you to go through my room, stay out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, just come here for a minute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, I'll do it later, Mom, I want to leave. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, just come here. I want to show you... something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh! Robbie just texted me and said Lamar left me two really long messages this morning. I'm so mad at this guy. &gt;&gt; ROB: You've tried so many times. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What am I supposed to do? I've-I've done everything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't want to admit that you're just sloppy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She treats Kylie like she's a little baby when she's not. She's growing into a young 201 00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,909 woman. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, just come here for a minute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'll do it later, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, just come here. I want to show you something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo...! Gave me a little face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can you just go, can you just go get her and tell her to come here for one second so I can show her what my plan is to help her in her life? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie? Kyles? What's wrong? Huh? Why? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She just comes into my room and she ruins everything. I want to move out so bad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's crying, and I feel really bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm trying to help her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ask her first before you get rid of her stuff. It's just not your business to go in there and do it. It's rude. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It kind of is my business as a parent to take care of my child. You know, Kim and Kourtney constantly berate me for putting up with too much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you remember Kourtney and Kim as teenagers? horrible. But they didn't have older siblings to play judgy-wudgy. Now Kourtney wants to go green all of a sudden and act like she never did anything bad. I get Kylie lives in my mom's house. But I definitely don't think it's cool that my mom went through Kylie's room. Everyone needs a little bit of their privacy. And Kylie is a great kid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe? I mean... Khloe. Kylie, can I talk to you for one s... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's naked! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, she needs to come out here and talk to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have no power in this house. Hey, Liz. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; LIZ: So this is the pig that is Kendall's friend that you said could come stay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The pig? &gt;&gt; LIZ: Remember when you said he could come stay here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: &gt;&gt; LIZ: I'm reading over all the information, 'cause now Kendall's not here, and I don't know what to do with it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean, "Kendall's not here"? Where's Kendall? &gt;&gt; LIZ: She's on that photo shoot in New York. Jana went with her, you had me book the whole thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So who's taking care of the ... pig? "Thanks so much, again, for watching Snow White. Don't know who else I would trust to do it for me. Have fun." &gt;&gt; LIZ: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, why aren't you here with your pig that you said you would take care of? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm coming home tomorrow. You told me I could take this pig on for a week. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, then you should have reminded me you were going out of town! You tricked me into this. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm sorry. It's not that big of a deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It is a big deal, Kendall, who's supposed to take care of the pig?! Uh, she hung up. &gt;&gt; LIZ: I mean, do you... It's supposed to go out on the grass and graze twice a day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What, is it a cow? &gt;&gt; LIZ: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does it bite? &gt;&gt; LIZ: Wrap it up on the sides and pick it up, sort of from the bottom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. It's okay. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Oh, rock-a-bye. Ooh! Snow White, Snow White, oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is what I have to listen to for ten days? &gt;&gt; LIZ: Oh! Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Don't get near the edge. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, okay. Ah! Okay, graze. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Oh, my goodness. It's really cute, though. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, let's not get that excited. &gt;&gt; LIZ: I do, I really like it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not that cute, yet. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: This is for the UK. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now how would that do? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: This one? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me try it on. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It would do well. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think it's fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What if you just take off... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: What if you just take off the dailies and keep the connecting? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...the tassel? Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, let's do that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie keeps texting texting me. She wants to move out of Mom's. Mom moved all of her ... and was like, "You have to clean your... you're a hoarder." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They took all the clothes out of her closet? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, all of her bed, all of her drawers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Or just clothes she thought were junk? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. My point is, if you were 15 and she does it to you, how pissed would you be? Kylie is still so mad at my mom for going through her room and going through all of her stuff and basically telling her what's trash and putting that in the hallway. I would be just as pissed. It's, like, a violation of your your space. It's rude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How does she have time to even do that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She had Jaclyn do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I cannot wait to change out of this hideous outfit. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: And then...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look so ugly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was just debating if I should do my workout at 8:30 or 9:00. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tonight or tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KIM: Tonight I have a 7:00 p.m. Seriously, if you're not doing anything and you want to stay for one... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who, me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I don't have workout clothes here. I should have brought them. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom does. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We don't have the same size shoe, I'm a size ten. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kendall does. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: True. Does she have skinny feet? &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hold on. What the ... was that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, ... Look at you! Oh, my God, oh, my God! Oh, my God! Let's go get your blanket. Okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay! Aw... I know. I'm the worst babysitter in the world. Oh! I'm sorry. Don't cry, don't cry. Poor little pig, jumping in the water. 319 00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:08,147 You're like Wilbur. Look how cute you are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Kylie's Weekly Schedule." You are so cool. "Tuesday, August 13th. Eyebrows at the house." And you have a nail appointment, and you get a tan. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I can't wait till these die. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love dead flowers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I heard you're not talking to the M-O-M. You're still mad. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. This is, like, the one space I have that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I like, it's my room, it's my stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm down for having privacy, and I tried to tell her that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just want to show her what it feels like to have your personal space invaded. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, so what do you want to do? You want to go into Mom's room stuff in garbage bags and leave it in the hallway like she did to you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I still don't think my mom fully understands what it feels like to have everything out of your room. I just want to be annoying and show her what it feels like, pretty much. All her Birkins need to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think we need five pairs of black Uggs? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's let the games begin. Oh, look, do you think we need six pairs, this many of the same slippers? All these rain boots, we live in California. Like, it doesn't rain. Kylie, help me. Let's get rid of all of these makeup brushes. She's gonna do her own makeup. All those bags. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? What's in the bags? And why are you in my room? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There's this Web site that has pigs. And I want to get Mom one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He left. I'm supposed to get word when he comes back. As many times as I've protected Lamar, lately, I'm getting 357 00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,165 bombarded with questions, and I don't know what to say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's in the bags? And why are you in my room? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's your stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's my stuff? First of all, you have no business in my room, because I am the mom. Second of all, I go out of my way to make things happen all the time. And it gets me crazy because I've been spending the last month figuring out what to do for your sweet 16. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: If this is what that's about, I don't need your help. I appreciate it, but if you're gonna throw it in my face like this, then I'd rather come in and just do it by myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna plan your whole sweet 16? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, good luck with that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All rightie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to change your attitude a little bit in that you need to respect... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, are you...? Don't even get me started. Seriously? There's a bottle of ranch dressing, salad, everything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't want to admit that you're just sloppy. &gt;&gt; KIM: You and Kendall are so sloppy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Both of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom is, like, such a hypocrite. She treats Kylie like she is a little baby when she's not. She's growing into a young woman. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm done. I'm just gonna plan on my own. But thanks, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's she gonna plan her own sweet 16? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, bye, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sayonara, sucka. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If Kylie thinks that she can plan her sweet 16 all by herself, then this will be her coming-to-Jesus moment, because she has no idea how hard I work for all of you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I get an amen? Can I get an amen?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I get an amen?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Amen. I want to brush you. Come here. It's okay. It's like a massage. Doesn't that feel good? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What're you doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: A little pig massage. She's so cute. Wilbur, say hi to Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why'd you name her Wilbur, Mom? She's not your pig. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Didn't you read the Charlotte's Web? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, but she's not your pig, Mom. You can't rename her. All right, thank you for watching her. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, wait, first of all, you're not gonna take her. Second of all, help me decide which, um, collar she should wear. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We have this collar, the gold. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, no. I'm gonna take her now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, Kendall, I want to play with her. Stop, she's very happy here. So what do you think about the collars? The black or the gold? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Uh, do what you want. I'll see you in the morning. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why did you make a face? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Maybe I should read as your 413 00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,599 bedtime story. Would you like that? &gt;&gt; GPS VOICE: After 300 feet, turn left at the end of the road, and then turn left at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want me to drive? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; GPS VOICE: Turn left. Turn left. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Help me figure out how theto turn this off. That's great. &gt;&gt; GPS VOICE: After 700 feet, turn left, turn left. Turn left. Turn left. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cancel guidance. Jesus Christ. Jeff. Hello? Yeah, he left. Uh, I'm supposed to get word when he comes back. He said he would be back within, like, an hour or two. 429 00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:51,557 He's just gonna go drive around. Yeah, he left. As many times as I've, like, protected Lamar or dodged a bullet for him, lately, everything is getting more than what I can protect or control. Yeah. Okay. No, of course. Of course. Okay, bye. I'm getting bombarded with 437 00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,885 questions, and I don't know what to say. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Happy birthday, Kylie! &gt;&gt; DJ: Make some noise! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you guys so much! &gt;&gt; ROB: I just don't want to be places, man. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why, though? You never used to be like that. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, well, obviously changed. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why has it changed? I'm starting to get worried. You know, I think that he's depressed. &gt;&gt; ROB: Like, I got myself into this position. I want to get myself back to where I was good. &gt;&gt; BRODY: But sometimes, you need help, Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so let's take this and put it... Get a Chanel bag for it, and then put this in Eric's pile. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, yeah. All right. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, mother. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Has she been grazed today, the pig? Do you know? Have we grazed her? Okay. Say hi to Wilbur. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you bringing her to my party? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I'm invited. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, I wanted to come here, 'cause I wanted to give you an invitation personally. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. But on a serious note, I definitely realized how much went into planning a party when I planned it myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a lot of work, right? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes, I would've loved your help. I'm really glad I planned this sweet 16 by myself. I think we should do white, and even if you just literally take red paint and put them all over... We can have the stage, you know, there. It really shows my mom I'm independent. I'm growing up. I can do things on my own now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so pretty. I am very, very proud of you, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I appreciate you as a mother. Thank you for letting this all happen. I accept my mom 100% for who she is, and I'm just hoping that she will accept me for who I am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm very sorry that I was a little aggressive with going through all of your stuff. Okay, 'cause I do... Give me a kiss. Let me kiss you. ...respect your space. I do. It won't happen again, okay? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, too. We're going to a party, Wilbur. 481 00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:36,055 Look, we get to go to the party. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't think we need that. What are you guys wearing to Kylie's sweet 16? Alice theme? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, not at all. I'm wearing a black, like, long dress with my black spiky Louboutins. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm, very chic. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom supposedly wants to be, like, the queen, and the queen has a pig or sits on a pig or something, so she wants to bring the pig to Kylie's birthday party. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There is not a pig in the movie. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, there is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh, look. She's holding it here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, there's this Web site that has pigs for sale, and I want to see... We should maybe get Mom one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is it called? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Posh Pigs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're thinking about getting your mom a pig as a pet? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She'll never take care of it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: This is it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's got too much going on; the last thing she needs is a pig in the house. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: True that. I mean, Scott's right. Buying my mom her own pig is not that great of an idea. She has so much going on already. I feel like she wouldn't really have time to take care of it, but I need to figure out a way to get it away from her so I can give it back to my friend. It's wearing a necklace. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh! Holy guacamole! Nice, one more... Oh! You almost went into the pool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's go give this little brat her car. Me and Rob and Kylie's best friend, Stass, are going to meet Kylie at her driver's test. You know, I took my driver's test at this same place? &gt;&gt; ROB: I did, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You did? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but... &gt;&gt; STASS: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; STASS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you guys excited for Saturday night? &gt;&gt; STASS: Yeah, so excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's gonna be crazy. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kylie and I are super close. You know, her sweet 16 is coming up, and I constantly remind her how sorry I am that I can't be there mentally and, like, physically, just 'cause I'm not happy with myself, and I don't want to go over my situation to every person at that party and just keep bringing that negative energy into my head. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to make her nervous. &gt;&gt; ROB: Me, neither. I'm very against that. Where should we park? But I just really want her to know that I'm always there for her, so, you know, I'm glad that I can support her on the day of her driver's test. &gt;&gt; STASS: That's her in the car. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is? &gt;&gt; STASS: Yeah, the driver's ed car. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, she's using the 535 00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,642 driver's ed car? &gt;&gt; STASS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I passed! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You passed? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hug me! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're not like Kendall then. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I passed, and it's just crazy that I passed my first time. I was so nervous. So excited, guys. It's so nice that Rob and Kourtney and my best friend came to give me my car and support me. Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so proud of you. 547 00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,579 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoa. &gt;&gt; BRODY: My man. Finally. I feel like... I haven't seen you. Oh, hey, I haven't seen you in so long, buddy. You smell all nice, too, for this hike. &gt;&gt; ROB: Really? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, what are you using? &gt;&gt; ROB: Soap. Anti-bacterial. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Stairs are good. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I ran these before, but I like to do every step. I don't like to skip. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, it's better to do every step. Upper, get the upper. Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, geez. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You all right? You're good. You have to do something that, you know, create something in your mind that motivates you. Put a picture of just some big, fake-ass booty right on your wall, like some chick just bent over, and say, "Damn, if I was all yoked up, I'd be rubbing my face in that thing." Do you like to slap it and watch it jiggle? &gt;&gt; ROB: Little bit. I like to just, like, go like that. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Like a pat to the bottom of it? Pop, pop, pop, pop. Like, that should bounce in your hands. &gt;&gt; ROB: But to be honest with you, just like they want to be with somebody, like... just like I want somebody who's attractive and good-looking and in good shape... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; ROB: ...they want the same, so... &gt;&gt; BRODY: If you're really that bummed out on it... &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm? &gt;&gt; BRODY: ...the only thing you can do is actually lose the weight. &gt;&gt; ROB: I know. And it's-it's just taking a little while, and now I'm kind of... This week, I've been in the work-out mode, so... &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know, but I've heard that. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You-you been saying that for a while. You know that. I'm starting to get worried, because Rob is kind of pushing us away a little bit, which I don't really know why. You know, I think that he's depressed, and the fact that he feels that way, it's a bummer. It makes me sad, because Rob is an incredible, incredible person. Hopefully he'll snap out of it, and I'm gonna try my best to get him to snap out of it, and I hope he does. And I don't want you to think that everybody's like, "Rob, you need to get back into shape." &gt;&gt; ROB: Right, right. &gt;&gt; BRODY: The only reason people are saying that is because it's affecting your personality... &gt;&gt; ROB: Right. &gt;&gt; BRODY: ...and you as a person, and... 'cause you're not like that. &gt;&gt; ROB: Right. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You're not like that unsocial, you know, "I don't want to go to lunch 'cause I don't want to be seen" type of guy. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just don't want to be places, man. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why, though? You never used to be like that. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, well... obviously changed. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why has it changed? &gt;&gt; ROB: Brody always wants to just kind of bond with me. He wants to know what's going on, and he wants... he's part of our family. And I do appreciate that, but there's certain things I... I can't even tell my own sisters. I'm just so big on, like, doing everything yourself. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know, I know. &gt;&gt; ROB: Like, I got myself into this position, I want to get myself back to where I was good. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I know, but sometimes you need help, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: I've been holding inside of me a lot of issues, not just with, you know, Lamar and Khloe but with myself and it just isn't healthy for me, you know. And it's hard when you have everybody looking in and assuming whatever's going on when they don't even know... half the story. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Sometimes you have to be able to accept help. And you're at a stage where it's not getting any better. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's definitely time for me to get my own house and focus on just myself, my health and my fitness and my business. And that's really it. &gt;&gt; KID: You stole his shirt. &gt;&gt; KID 2: You took my shirt, &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You think I took your shirt? I got ten little kids bothering me, trying to see if I'll flip out. &gt;&gt; KID 1: I bet you think I'm a douche bag. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think you're a douche bag. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott has definitely gotten a few drinks in there. Are you wasted? Relax, relax, relax. We're at a sweet 16. 631 00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,818 Like, get it together. You're disgusting. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; EMCEE: So we have our first person. Are we all good up there to, uh, let some guests up? Perfect, thank you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, Wilbur. Hey, guys. I just pulled up to Kylie's sweet 16, and I'm so excited to see it, because Kylie's worked really hard to make this party something special. Hi, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you look so pretty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, thank you. 643 00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,234 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Kylie in Wonderland"! Hi! Kylie is so creative. Looking at these amazing decorations that Kylie pulled together. Did you see the chair over there? It's so cute! This is the first time I'm seeing it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, do you approve? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah! Everything is so fantastic and beautiful. It's just remarkable. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait. Where's the pig? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The pig is in the playpen. In the back. In a really quiet little room. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know my mom really likes this pig, but this is just not the proper place for a pig at all. Come here, sweetheart. I'm sorry. So I decided while my mom is really focused on seeing what Kylie's done with this party, I'll grab the pig, sneak it away and give it back to my friend, and everybody's happy and good. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. Here you go. See you later. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I missed her so much. Thanks. Bye, Ken. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can I just get a white wine? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can I get a champagne? &gt;&gt; BARTENDER: There's no champagne. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY:! Hi. I'm gonna have some white wine, then. &gt;&gt; BARTENDER: White wine? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey! Where are we going? Throwing the party was very difficult, but it's done and I'm excited and it's time to party. 675 00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:30,122 ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You guys gonna dance? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad! Love you! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bring me, like, a tall glass of white wine. &gt;&gt; DJ: If you're having a good time, make some noise! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie Jenner, we want to wish you a happy birthday. I love you, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you guys so much! Thank you for coming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Happy birthday, Kylie. Maybe there's a part of me that wants to hang on to the fact baby-- but I am so impressed with the way that she has put this party together, and I have to give her more credit, because she's all grown up. So proud of you! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have fun! &gt;&gt; DJ: If you came out to party tonight, make some noise! Come on! Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you wasted? Relax, relax, relax. I know when Scott's been drinking-- it's very easy to tell on him. I mean, he's not, like, out of control, but he's definitely gotten a few drinks in there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Tell somebody to get 700 00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:51,636 us a cocktail waitress. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where the is Scott? &gt;&gt; KID 1: Do you know this guy? &gt;&gt; KID 2: Why did you move to L.A.? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Because, I guess, I had enough money... &gt;&gt; KID 2: You met the women and... &gt;&gt; KID 1: Scott, you're a pimp, dude. &gt;&gt; KID 2: I mean, you met the women. &gt;&gt; KID 1: Pimp on three. One, two, three... &gt;&gt; KIDS: Pimp! Pimp! &gt;&gt; KID 1: You're supposed to put your hand in, dude. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just trying to mind my own business and I'm not trying to get into any trouble. &gt;&gt; KID 2: You stole his shirt. &gt;&gt; KID 1: You took my shirt, &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You think I took your shirt? I got ten little kids bothering me, antagonizing me, trying to see if I'll flip out, like everybody thinks. &gt;&gt; KID 1: He can't use our lingo. You can't use our crew's lingo, dude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you guys know where Scott is? &gt;&gt; KID 2: What kind of jacket is that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Tom Ford. &gt;&gt; KID 1: I bet you think I'm a douche bag. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think you're a douche bag. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KID 1: I'll see you around. Let's all go outside. Let's all go outside. Let's go. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where have you been? We've been looking for you for, like, an hour. What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Some little kids were, like, trying to fight me in the bathroom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not going home with you. You're disgusting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? These little kids werewith me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't care. I have to go. Stay here. I'm going. You're disgusting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: These kids were trying to fight me in the bathroom. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm in desperate need of fixing myself, so I'm a hundred percent moving out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think it's good timing? Like, why do you choose to do this, like, now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is so annoying. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: What happened? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's being a drunk slob kabob. Scott's been drinking, and he tells me that there was, like, some sort of altercation or something. I'm just, like, what is going on? We're at a sweet 16-- like, get it together. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh! I see a bunny! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I realize that they're all in the girls' bathroom, but... I didn't do anything wrong, and they should know that. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Scott, why are you in the women's room? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, why are you in here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bible. These kids circled around me. They were, like, you think you're a big shot, like... just 'cause of a reality show? The kid took his shirt off and was like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't care about the kids! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is like a bad high school after school special. Like, I don't even know what's happening. Why are you fighting at a 16- year-old's party? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're, like, out of control. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott is not fighting with any 16-year-old in the bathroom, and if he has a drink, who cares? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott was trying to kiss Mom! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I doubt he tried to kiss Mom, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, he was sucking on her face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bible, he tried to kiss Mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like I care, but I'm saying. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna be honest with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-oh, Kourt. He's been good lately, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He deals with real from everyone every single day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, I have a really hard day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, I'm fine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me tell you something-- if there is anything you want me to do out there, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Out where? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Out in the street. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want you to do anything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just relax and be normal. Maybe I just am more sensitive because I've been through different situations with Scott in the past. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are not posing! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, it's also been a really long time since Scott and I have even been out together, and been having fun. And maybe I just need to loosen up so we can enjoy Kylie's sweet 16. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I never tried to kiss your mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did I? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom told me you were sucking in her face. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Everyone head to the screen, please. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So gorgeous! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, here we are. It's August 11, and Kendall's looking at her new baby sister for the first time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall made this beautiful video for Kylie and it is really, really sweet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Happy birthday, buddy. I hope your fours are gonna be good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie has grown up so fast. One minute ago, she's three years old, and the next minute she's a mature adult. 801 00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:26,144 It feels like time and life is going by at lightning speed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you have a fun time? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Say good-bye to the camera. Say good-bye. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: All right, make some noise for that video, please. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is easily the best night of my life. All of my friends are here, my family, which I'm so grateful for. Seeing everyone else have a good time is, like, what I wanted, and it was just a plus that I had a great time, too. I love you guys. Thank you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? Lamar? Honestly, I came here to escape and have a nice time tonight, and now Lamar won't, like, stop calling me. I cannot deal with all the drama. It's too much for me. Should we just go? 822 00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,577 &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. ♫ ♫ Rob. Did you, like, really do all this? Oh. Are we on a date? &gt;&gt; ROB: I guess. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so crazy. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is the place where I, um, bring girls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robbie just texted me and said, "Lamar left me two really long messages this morning. 832 00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,674 I'm so mad at this guy. So sorry I'm venting." &gt;&gt; ROB: That's sad. But still, it's, like, you've tried so many times. It's not like it was a week of this, a month of this, and, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but no one knows that but you because you've lived there. A lot has been going on, um, the past couple years just with me and Lamar, and I've made that choice myself to just keep that within my marriage, but lately, it's getting bigger than me. It's scary, and... &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...there's a lot going on, and there's, like, paparazzi. There are just, like, hundreds that just wait outside my gates. &gt;&gt; ROB: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, it's not easy. &gt;&gt; ROB: No. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sometimes things are bigger than yourself, and I don't have, like, a plan. I don't know what the next step is. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know. Like, he's so lovable, liked by everybody, and he's a great 851 00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:57,028 athlete, and it sucks. It's just never been this way. All you can do is pray and just keep trying if you want to try. If not, you know... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What am I supposed to do? I've done everything. &gt;&gt; ROB: I know, so, you have to let him figure it out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If someone, God forbid, gets their legs cut off, or you get breast cancer, whatever, like, do you just leave someone because they're, like, slowing down your life? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, but you... no, but it's-it's, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was trying to help and save, but there's nothing more... &gt;&gt; ROB: It's worse than that, 'cause he's, like... he's really hurting you. It's not even a win situation for anybody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, well, let's not talk about all the bad energy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm. &gt;&gt; ROB: But do you want me to tell you why I brought you here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; ROB: Do you want me to tell you why I brought you here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: I really just brought you here because I wanted you to know in, like, the proper way this time, compared to last time, that, um, you know, I've found a place. I'm 100%, like, committed to moving out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But do you think it's, like, good timing? &gt;&gt; ROB: For me, it's necessary because... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, why do you choose to do this, like, now? &gt;&gt; ROB: 'Cause I'm in desperate need of, like, fixing myself. Like, I need to be healthy, I 882 00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:37,895 need to work out, I need to get out of that bad energy. I hate to see my sister hurt, and it's just sad to see someone who is my best friend and my brother going through just a hard little situation, because he's part of our family. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Roberto! You like 'em? &gt;&gt; ROB: Not with those jeans. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Listen... &gt;&gt; ROB: Those are... What?! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Keep it real. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's definitely time for me to get out of that house, because I've been holding in so much, and as much as I love and respect my sister Khloe and want to be there for her, I really need to fix myself. It's just not good energy. 896 00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:17,468 You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, Rob... &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, maybe it's time for a change for everybody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Even though I understand why Rob wants to move out, you know, I wish him and I could live together forever. I mean, that's me being selfish. But I get it. You know, it's not the best environment right now to be in. &gt;&gt; ROB: Obviously, you're more than welcome to stay at my place, or if anything you need, I'm right down the street. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Lamar is my husband, and I fell in love with him instantly. I mean, I got married to him in 30 days. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Would you marry me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Please welcome to the floor, Mrs. Khloe Odom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've done so many things on my own, and tried to put the pieces back together all on my own. Obviously, I would love to help him and let him live his life, but I don't know what else to do. &gt;&gt; ROB: But you also have to live your own life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm at war with myself. Like, I want to help them, but then, maybe sometimes, the best help is maybe stepping away? And I just feel like I might need some more help. 919 00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:41,085 So I have to kind of tell my family.
