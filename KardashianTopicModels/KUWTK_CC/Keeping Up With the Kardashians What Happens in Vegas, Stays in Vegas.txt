- &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just wanted to make sure you guys are both ready to witness the man, myth, the icon, critique other people. Are you ready? I'm just asking a question! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not if you talk like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, if you talk like that, I can't. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sorry, babe, that's how I'm doing it. If you can't handle the truth, you can't handle anything. And now the icon at work. &gt;&gt; JOAN RIVERS: Tonight on Fashion Police... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at the gentleman. Nobody dresses better than me. &gt;&gt; JOAN: ...we are thrilled to have a man who my gay friends call "The prettiest Kardashian sister," Scott Disick. &gt;&gt; COHOST: And the number one must-see look of the week, one of your friends, Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; JOAN: Now what do you think, Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's a little crazy having nothing in the middle. It'd be like if I came with my suit and had my, like, crotch open. &gt;&gt; JOAN: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not funny. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's funny. Everybody thought it was funny. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, everyone else is being nice to me, and the closest person to me in that room is being a &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was being nice. I just said I wouldn't walk around with my crotch open. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tone it down. Take it down a notch. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't. That wouldn't be me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, you're a total &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna say what's on my mind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You super &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Watch yourself 'cause 31 00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,238 Daddy's in the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, you've reached Kardashian Communications. I pretty much work 24/7. Hello? Saturday you all have the Sears meeting. Are you guys shooting outside? Good job, Kourt. I have a ton of work to do, and you're wasting my time. Just hang in there, and I'll be right over. There's so much going on, it leaves very little personal time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How was your day at school, guys? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? Like, tell me what's going on at school. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I started track. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When did you do that? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I do track every year. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Cheer just ended. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you like it, Kendall? Do you love it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love it. Yep. My tumbling-- the have it right down the street. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys took a tumbling class? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a trampoline place where they can go and jump on trampolines. They got a whole bunch of trampolines. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When did you go there? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know how to do a backflip off the wall. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? When did you do this? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you drunk? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. This is scaring me right now. Like, how can I not know this stuff? I feel kinda dumb. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There's this girl that's pregnant. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Pregnant? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. In my grade. She's 13. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, 13 years old? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm being serious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She's pregnant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 13? For real? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She said 13. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're drunk. It's, like, listen to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, there's a sleeping baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sorry. I brought you leftovers. So, last night I learned Kylie joined track. She joined the track team, and I didn't even know she joined track. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're too busy, and you need to make time before you lose them and they get too old. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I actually know something about my kids, just not their social life right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So if you know them so well, I'll give you a pop quiz. What are the names of Kylie's three best friends? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Zoey... Zoey and Zoey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. You failed. You need to stay, like, super involved. I know Bruce does that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have 17 different hats that I wear. And I have about 32 jobs. Aside from that... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, well, you need to make your mom hat the biggest hat and, like, wear that at all times. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really feel like Kourtney needs to be a little more accepting of me and what my situation is today. It's so much different than when I was a mom 30 years ago. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Before you know it, they're gonna be in college, and then you're gonna not know what to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I get it. I get what you're saying. I'm not stupid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. 92 00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:44,157 I'm over this convo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Whatever. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; ERICA JAFFE: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Things have been awfully good. I can't really complain. Things have been pretty good in my life. You know, I'm going to Vegas this weekend. A friend of mine owns this new club, so he asked me to host. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: By no means do I want to be irresponsible while I'm actually so-called working. I have a great opportunity to host a big party in Vegas where I get paid to go to a nightclub and have some drinks and be social. I'm hoping my therapist can give me some advice, then I'll speak to Kourtney and let her know what I'm thinking. &gt;&gt; ERICA: It sounds like it's challenging. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It is. &gt;&gt; ERICA: What does that mean for you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A part of me feels like the whole drinking thing, I needed to give up to kinda get my life in order. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I like to be able drink, maybe two drinks. You know, I like to feel normal and I like to be able to fit in. &gt;&gt; ERICA: You know, I think that for yourself having alcohol in your life is really dangerous... for you, for your family. And if we're talking about being an alcoholic, then sobriety is the only way to go. There isn't a choice. Is there anything else that you want to talk about today? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think we covered quite a bit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cook up that chicken potpie, I think. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, we have a chef. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not tonight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's right. Well, here, get a cookie sheet. I'm so annoyed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God, what is it now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney was saying to me I'm not as good of a mother to Kendall and Kylie as I was to Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloe and Robert when they were growing up, you know? And I'm, like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I agree with her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I agree with her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You agree with her? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-huh. When was the last time you carpooled one of the kids? You haven't carpooled them in years, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you're gonna sit here and give me a list of everything I didn't do? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You had to hire a chef because you didn't have enough time to even cook for them. You spend all day in the office. If you're not in the office, you're totally distracted by your little BlackBerry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was the room mother, I was the Brownie leader, I was the soccer coach. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not saying you're not a good mom! But to compare the girls' growing up... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...with their mother and compare Kendall and Kylie growing up with their mother, it's two different worlds. That's all it is. You're not a bad person. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, all right, fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do I preheat the oven at?! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We haven't been out to dinner in a while. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We haven't. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, it's weird. Maybe that's why you were bitchy last night. You actually put me down for leaving a light on. Imagine if I got after you for every single little thing. What about when you let your bush grow out 'cause you just didn't care anymore? Did I get after you for that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it actually was really cool. I should bring it back again. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Boo, I gotta tell ya. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got a great offer to do an appearance at Chateau in Vegas, Stevie's new place. So? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When are you thinking of doing it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Saturday night. We'll just go together? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have a work thing on both days-- that day and the next day-- so I couldn't, like, go at night and come back. Have you been thinking about drinking lately? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not really. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really don't feel comfortable knowing Scott's previous issues that he's had going to Vegas... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I might end up doing some bad things tonight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What theis going on in here? &gt;&gt; WAITER: I can't get you... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's been on such a good path that I really don't want anything to damage that. I just don't know if going to Vegas alone without me is the best idea. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Man, you know, for once, I really trust myself in this situation. And I really think you should trust me. Nothing's gonna happen, okay? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are the lights working? Not yet, huh? The Taj MaKris is coming together. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Pretend we're swimming. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you ready? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Swim, ready, go! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Another victory! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce is so good with Kendall and Kylie, and spends so much time with them while I'm working. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Can I get on your back? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like life is passing me by, because I'm always so busy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When I raised Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloe, and Rob, I was the soccer coach, and the Brownie leader. Every single thing I did was wrapped around those kids' lives. So I've decided to start really getting involved with both of my girls, and spend more time with them. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Five, six, seven, eight... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, girls. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know that dance. Do you go, like... : Hey... Ho... Ha, ha-ha... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. Let's go upstairs, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have a boyfriend, Maddie? &gt;&gt; MADDIE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have a boyfriend, Spencer? &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Nope. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have a boyfriend, Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nope. Do you have a boyfriend, Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Nope. Okay, Mom, we're not here to talk about boyfriends, but thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you guys love Justin Bieber? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom. Go away. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We were actually having fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I think I'll go downstairs and order you guys some pizza. Okay? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good. Close the door and lock it, please. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Lock the door. &gt;&gt; MADDIE: Does your mom hang out with you guys a lot? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know what's up with her. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Mid-life crisis? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, she is going through menopause. 219 00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,214 &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm ready for Vegas, baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't think you should go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? At 8:00 in the morning you're going to tell me you don't think I should go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that you should stay here, you're safe here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna show you that I'm gonna be fine, and I have a million people counting on me. I can't just say no because you don't want me to. I would love to say no, for you, and just not go and stay home with you and Mason. But that's just not in the cards right now. I gotta go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't want anyone to be, like, pressuring you to drink. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I mean, like I said, I'm not there to get drunk. You look pretty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just don't feel good about this. There's obviously nothing I can do to stop Scott going to Vegas, but I'm going to try to do my best to not think about it, and hope that everything goes okay. &gt;&gt; FRANKEL: It's about time! Yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, this is what you gotta hang out with. No riling up Scott. &gt;&gt; FRANKEL: What are you talking about? He doesn't even drink. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's right. 246 00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,224 &gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Oh! Here we go. Now we're talking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Seeing Scott and all of his guy friends there, with bottles of champagne, in front of me, definitely is not reassuring. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go! Vegas! Bye, doll. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Call him and see what he's doing. &gt;&gt; RECORDING: Your call has been forwarded... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott sends me to voice mail, which definitely makes me nervous. I'm not going to be able to stop thinking about it until I hear from him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt... &gt;&gt; MAN: You're in Las Vegas, bitches! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's drinks everywhere. 261 00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:06,733 What do you want from me? It's Vegas. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: We're going ice-skating, we're going ice-skating, we're going ice-skating... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going ice-skating... I'm driving the girls to go ice-skating. It's the perfect time for me to get some bonding time in with the girls. ...we're going ice-skating. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, stop. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going ice... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We should play Chinese fire drill. I'm being serious, let's play it right now, Chinese fire drill, go! Go! &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Lock her out, lock her out, lock her out! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is ridiculous. Who wants to go ice-skating? &gt;&gt; MADDIE: I do! &gt;&gt; GIRLS: I do! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I remember this place. I want to go skating. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I come with you guys? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Um, sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My mom is always working and never wants to hang out. 284 00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,397 I don't know what's going on, and this is just awkward. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Can you pull me, Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Pull you? &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Oh, just like when we were running. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My mom has gone crazy. Who does she think she is? This is so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; MADDIE: I would probably die if my mom did that. 293 00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,582 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's just like, plain embarrassing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing, fella. I've never really been sober in this place. &gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Hey, welcome to Las Vegas. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So I just got to Vegas. Definitely brings back some old memories, but, you know, I'm confident I can keep it together. Oh, man. &gt;&gt; J.J.: This is going to get sexy. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Scott, we're getting shots. They're called a duck fart. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys are crazy. How you doing? &gt;&gt; J.J.: Hi, Candace. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Scott. &gt;&gt; CANDACE: Anything I can get you guys started off with...? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can we just have like a bucket of ice and just waters, for now, and stuff like that? &gt;&gt; CANDACE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; J.J.: Is there like a vodka lemonade? And like a bunch of... like a bucket of beers. &gt;&gt; CANDACE: Okay. &gt;&gt; J.J.: This is... oh, look at that guy! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that guy is the best! We need theGooch down here. &gt;&gt; J.J.: What an idiot! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's a typical Vegas atmosphere. Every single person is drinking 317 00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:23,736 and all I really want is to feel normal and fit in. Vegas is definitely not an easy place to stay grounded, but you know, I've had my life under control for over a year. I mean, having one drink at the pool is not going to hurt anybody. All right, cheers to a responsible one drink for the day. &gt;&gt; J.J.: All right, I'm glad. One, and we'll keep... we'll cut you off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Cheers, Vegas, baby. Having this vodka and lemonade, by the pool, with all my friends, was pretty nice. Cheers, Vegas, baby. &gt;&gt; MAN: Cheers. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Gooch! &gt;&gt; J.J.: The Gooch. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My friend. &gt;&gt; J.J.: Everyone's gotta have a Gooch. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can we get a round of beers? You know what? Can I just have a vodka lemonade? I mean, what do you want from me? It's Vegas. &gt;&gt; J.J.: Atta boy. 336 00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,625 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to get the chicken sandwich. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Then I'll take the same thing. &gt;&gt; WAITER: How simple. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How simple are we? How do you know this place? I've never eaten here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We used to go here. It's the place that Kendall likes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, it's really good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls came into the kitchen, and, uh, they said they wanted me to talk to you. They love you to death, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, brother. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're driving them crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm driving them crazy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, you're driving them crazy. I guess you were at the ice- skating rink and wouldn't leave them alone, and this and that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was just trying to find ways that I could actually bond with them and share some stuff with them that I used to share with all the other kids. I don't want to drive them crazy. I just feel really guilty and I feel like a very bad mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're a great mom, but... What you have to learn is, you can leave the office behind and then spend time with the family, but don't force yourself on them. Just enjoy the time that you 360 00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,254 have with them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm excited to do what I came to do, and that's a work appearance. And, you know, what's better than getting paid to party? You know what, give me a Johnnie Walker on the rocks, Black. A little ice, a little water. &gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Johnnie Walker? You're not really drinking that, are you? 369 00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,151 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll have one cocktail at dinner. &gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Salud. &gt;&gt; MAN: Salud. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Gooch, get up and show them a dance. Get up and sing them a song. &gt;&gt; GOOCH: No, no, no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Gooch, you're going to get up, you're going to sing them a Keith, tell him yes. &gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT:no. Gooch. &gt;&gt; GOOCH: No, we can sing in a little while, when everybody sits down. &gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Now you're going to behave, right? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'm going to behave. I'm a gentleman now. &gt;&gt; FRANKEL: You're a gentleman. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't you get it? &gt;&gt; FRANKEL: I get it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's everything I could have dreamed of and more. I love all my friends. Thank you for being here. &gt;&gt; MAN: Cheers. &gt;&gt; J.J.: Cheers... &gt;&gt; FRANKEL: You slap me one more time though, I'm going to kick theout of you all over theStrip. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, hey, oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is Mason asleep? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He just went down. Scott is in Vegas. I hate sleeping at home alone. So I brought Mason over to Khloe's house and we're going to sleep over here tonight. Since Scott still hasn't called... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you tried calling him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I don't want to be like a stalker, where he's like, "Why don't you trust me? You're calling me all the time." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just say if it's bothering you, call him. Why do you care? Like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I'm just saying he's in Vegas and it's been this thing and he's with his friends. I don't want to be, like, calling every second. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But if it makes you feel weird, call him and see what he's doing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think it's a big deal. Seriously. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, shh. &gt;&gt; RECORDING: Your call has been forwarded... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was going to say, does he have a voice mail? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott sends me to voice mail, which definitely makes me nervous. I just hope that he hasn't come this far just to go back to the way that he used to be. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know how loud Vegas is. He could be doing anything-- taking a shower... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's not taking a shower. It's late at night. Like, he went to dinner and then they were going to the club. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Then perfect. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's hosting at the club. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, then that's where he is. &gt;&gt; MAN: You're in Las Vegas, 418 00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,775 bitches! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know what I got myself into. There's drinks everywhere. 422 00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,384 (man speaks indistinctly over speakers) &gt;&gt; MAN: Shout out for my man, Scott Disick... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Text me and say, "I can't hear. It's loud. I'll call you later." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agree, he probably should have done that, but maybe he'll send you a text in a minute. You need to, like, relax a little. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not going to be able to stop thinking about it until I hear from him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt... &gt;&gt; J.J.: Are we cool? &gt;&gt; 435 00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,941 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's everyone doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nothing crazy, but, you know, they're here to Vegas to, like, party, where, you know, I'm here to make money and work and go home, and they're here acting as if it's, like, Mardi Gras, you know, what I mean? I'm taking it easy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, good. You promised? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I'm good, doll, I promise. Okay, love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; MAN: You're in Las Vegas, bitches! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, Kylie, can I talk to you guys for a second? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're not going to talk about boys again, are we? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we're not going to talk about boys, but, um... No, this is serious. I realize how much more time I spent with Kourtney and Kimberly and Khloe and Robert when they were little than I've really been spending with you guys right now. And it really makes me sad that I work so hard, and I feel like I don't want to miss anything. : And it's hard, like, as a mom, it really is, to feel like you're missing moments. And we're all going in so many different directions. I don't want to wake up in, like, five years and you guys are in college and you don't live here anymore. I love you so much, and I don't want to embarrass you in front of your friends. But I am crazy in love with you guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, you know we love you, like, but we're teenagers. We like to go out and hang out with our friends. I mean, you were a teenager once. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's not like we don't want to hang out with you. It's just that it was... unexpected. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I will hang out with the two of you as much as you'll let me hang out with you. Do we have a deal here, guys? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, oh, oh. I love you guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ow, my ear. Leave me alone! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not going to leave you alone. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You know I'm really ticklish! Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I missed you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Missed you, too. I am glad to be home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me, too. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You look pretty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So how was it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, I knew I would be fine and be responsible, even though you thought I wouldn't be. And I'm happy that I was good, and it was easy.
