- &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. This is Kris. &gt;&gt; Hey, Kris, this is Michele, calling from <i>Playboy.</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Michele. &gt;&gt; MICHELE: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Fine, thank you. &gt;&gt; MICHELE: Listen, we would really love for Kim to pose for our celebrity issue, the one that comes out in December. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my. So I get a call from <i>Playboy,</i> asking if Kim will do a celebrity pictorial for the December cover. I just don't know how she's gonna react. &gt;&gt; KIM: How does this look on? Have we sold any of these? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. So cute. Lily, the windows look so cute today. &gt;&gt; LILY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Darling. Okay, so listen. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just got off the phone with <i>Playboy,</i> and they want you to be the model to do a celebrity pictorial. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They really, really, really, really, really want to do it. Wouldn't that be fun? &gt;&gt; KIM: Fun for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't have to take anything off. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I don't have to take anything off? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's <i>Playboy.</i> Ever since the sex tape scandal, I have to be really careful at how I'm perceived. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it would be an awesome experience for you if nothing else. On top of all of that, it's a ton of money. &gt;&gt; KIM: People are going to say, like, oh, you know, all she's good for is taking her clothes off. Does she do anything else? Can you guarantee that I'm not going to have to take my clothes off? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what she's saying. &gt;&gt; KIM: it's really going to be something that I'm going to have to think about it. The whole tape issue, I think that if that never came out, then I would be more inclined to do <i>Playboy.</i> I really have mixed feelings about it. &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, no, no. You're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys. Is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, good. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm going to need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. Jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; Nice, guys. That's it. We're done. &gt;&gt; Money. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; Okay guys. I want to tell you something. I really want to talk to my family and see how they all kind of react to it and help me make the decision. I'm just going to do like a sexy celebrity pictorial. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what they all say. They all say it's going to be really classy and fabulous. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it is really classy. It's the December cover. Like, that's a huge deal. You know, and this decision is, like, really hard for me. I don't want to upset Bruce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you told Bruce? &gt;&gt; KIM: Not exactly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We don't care what Bruce thinks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We do care. We know what Bruce thinks. He's very conservative. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's going to think you're being a whore. &gt;&gt; KIM: He was on the cover of <i>Playgirl.</i> Okay, so he can't really talk. Bruce was on the cover of <i>Playgirl</i> back when he had that Olympic body. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is sickenin'. &gt;&gt; That is sickenin'. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He wasn't posing naked. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He just did it for the articles. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, what do you think she should do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think she should do it. I think it'll be really great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Of course you want her to do it with your ten- percent manager commission. I know about you. Hey, Brucey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So when would you be doing this deed? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The what deed? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim's thinking about doing <i>Playboy.</i> &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It'll be a gorgeous pictorial and she doesn't have to show anything that she doesn't want to show. She doesn't have to take anything crazy off. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So I guess no matter what I say, you're gonna do it anyway, huh? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I think Kim values your opinion. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, here's my opinion on it: Um, it is on the edge; you're kind of taking a big risk here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I say step it up to <i>Penthouse.</i> Go for it if you're really gonna go. Do it with class, but undress that ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That'll be your slogan. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm doing it with class 'cause I got a big ass. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so, I've decided. I told you I'd make my decision. I've decided I'm gonna do <i>Playboy.</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are? &gt;&gt; KIM: But... but you have to make sure that I'm not nude, all the way nude. Has to be like set in stone in my contract that I'm not all the way naked. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, no problem. I think, I think that we can, you know, that's a done deal. I'll take care of it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now get out there and run around the block. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm gonna go to the store. &gt;&gt; KIM: Cardio. Cardio, cardio, cardio. I'll see you in a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Pretty scary when I'm the only one to vote no on Kimberly doing <i>Playboy.</i> I mean, she's got a sex tape out, now she's doing <i>Playboy?</i> Please, this is your daughter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The whole point of doing it is because it's something she doesn't have to get naked for. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, she's not showing her... &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's not... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...nipple. All right, she's showing everything else. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's not gonna be a Playmate. When you do a celebrity spread, it's a much different thing than doing, um, a centerfold. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, nothing wrong with being a Playmate. It's just that I don't think Kimberly should be one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I agree with you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, but do you think her father would say, "Oh, boy"? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, can we not get into all of that? Just, let's do this. This is getting way too heavy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She doesn't need <i>Playboy.</i> <i>Playboy</i> needs her more than she needs them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just think you're really conservative and really over the top and I think that you... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Over the top? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, in your mind... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not the one in <i>Playboy.</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you were in <i>Playgirl,</i> you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So before you judge somebody, you always... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not judging her. I'm just saying it's probably not the right thing to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You always judge people for doing the same thing you've already done and that's not cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have not done! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did Playgirl. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You were on the cover of <i>Playgirl.</i> &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, an article about me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, well, okay, maybe it's an article about her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I wasn't in there, you know... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why do you not judge it, you know? She's in lingerie... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's no reason why I should even bring this stuff up because it doesn't make any difference. You guys are gonna do what you want to do, you know? And if you think it's good to sell Kimberly in <i>Playboy,</i> sell. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Guys, let's go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce is showing Kim how to work out? I'm definitely not missing this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You sit in the corner and you don't make a comment. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whatever you say, Hitler. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kim's made a decision to do <i>Playboy.</i> I don't agree with it, but I do support her. It's time to get her in shape. &gt;&gt; KIM: How many calories do I need to burn to lose a pound? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, I don't know. I don't worry about calories. I worry about sweat. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't really sweat that much. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, the thing is if you ain't sweatin', you ain't working. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's so not true. I love that there's mirrors behind me so I can see my ass melting away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce takes working out so seriously. This is the perfect time to mess with him. Do you know what a Kegel exercise is? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't? I really want someone to teach me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...15. At the end, I'm gonna squirt a surprise on your face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can we get tans while Kim's working out? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, Khloe, come on. We're working out. Just go, go. Leave, leave. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't talk? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, not to us. She's working out. You can go have a ball doing something else. &gt;&gt; Come here. I want to show you this bus. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take the stick out of your ass, dude. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm on my way to go shoot for <i>Playboy.</i> So I'm really excited. I'm nervous, but I'm really excited. I'm Kim. &gt;&gt; ROB: Nice to meet you. I'm Rob. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Welcome to <i>Playboy.</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: This is so cool. &gt;&gt; HOLLY MADISON: You're gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; HOLLY: I'm sure everybody tells you that, but I'm really happy that you're posing because you're phenomenal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I haven't even gotten dressed today 'cause I've been running around doing stuff for you. So I come running in here... &gt;&gt; KIM: You're really getting your hair done? That's so for me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just relax and try and take to take a deep breath, okay? Steven, I'll be right back. I need to get my makeup done. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Who gets her makeup done on the set of my photo shoot? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a little embarrassed to say this, but it's always been a life-long dream of mine to pose for <i>Playboy.</i> Maybe we could do like a mother-daughter issue. &gt;&gt; Right there. Bring the face to me. Very nice. There you go. Let your hands move a little bit. Bring the breasts to me, to me. There you go. That's very nice. How much nudity are you prepared for? If you were like that without the top-- can I show you what it would look like? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but I... &gt;&gt; You don't want to do that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just like, I just don't want be... so... &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: For any of the shots. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not comfortable taking my top off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you mean taking your top off? Kim, from the get-go, this was a... what they call a celebrity photo shoot, and you don't have to take your clothes off at all. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What they want you to do is take all your clothes off so they can cover you with stuff. And make you feel comfortable. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not what they were doing before. They were saying, "Take it off, take it off. They're getting upset, they're getting upset. Take it off." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need someone to be like, no, she's not taking it off. She'll write you a check for double the money and say you, and walk out of here. &gt;&gt; ROB: Last night in talking to Hef, Hef is very serious about trying to get this pumped up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can just tell that they're all uncomfortable that we're not going to get these shots for Hef, that he's going to like because I'm not taking it off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim has no desire to do, you know, any kind of a shot, judging from the problems that she's had, you know, in the past. &gt;&gt; ROB: We want you to be comfortable. &gt;&gt; KIM: In the end, I'm sticking to, you know, what I believe in and not showing too much. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. The shots are amazing. And I'm so glad I did it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Great job, Kim. Hey, I just got a call from <i>Playboy,</i> and they want some more... showing a little more skin, actually. Does she have to take her clothes off? &gt;&gt; HUGH HEFNER: Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like the pearls. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Can I look, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good shoes. Look how cute those shoes are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're staring at her shoes when her ass is out? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: That's really hot, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you think? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is so cute. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Your bod... You look like a playmate or something. That's weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, I said you're not to look at them. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Oh, my God. We can't look at this stuff. &gt;&gt; No. Huh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, look at this one, you guys. Mom is like, "It looks great. It looks great. Take it off." I'm like, "I don't want my boobs out, you know." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, all you got to do is lay there and look gorgeous. It's fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, why don't <i>you</i> do it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: A naked photo shoot? I would let somebody see me naked, like a photographer? &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's set that up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bring it on. &gt;&gt; KEVIN: All right, good. We're setting that up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Try. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm dead serious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For what? To embarrass me? &gt;&gt; KIM: I've decided to kind of turn the tables on her. It's her turn to take it off. Don't worry, I'll make sure that it's done totally professionally. There'll be all the right people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The manager, manager. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm going to play manager for the day and give my mom a taste of her own medicine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I can bitch at you all day long. &gt;&gt; KIM: We need to... &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Where? What's this? Why didn't you do that? Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!" &gt;&gt; KIM: My job is easy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, that's what you do to me all day long. I would love for you to be my manager for the day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ready or not, here we come. Oh, I got these for you, Mom. So I want to kind of give her a taste of what it's like to be uncomfortable naked. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: What do you think? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I look sad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Me. What do you think I look like? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, oh, sorry. You look pretty sexual. I think you should be like that. But let me show you your first look. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. That's my first look? &gt;&gt; KIM: That is your first look. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do I get to wear the robe? &gt;&gt; KIM: You can wear the jewelry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, that's a gold thong and a gold medal and some gold loops. You want me to wear a curtain? &gt;&gt; KIM: Show the ass. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like I'm at the gynecologist's office. How do you do this? &gt;&gt; Off this picture. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Manager. Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's going for the gold. You're digging for gold. You should be used to that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shut up you.. &gt;&gt; KIM: Now that's fab. Can we just do one with the boobs exposed? It's amazing. Push 'em up so they don't look like Star Jones. &gt;&gt; We have a clamp? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's perfect, Mom. &gt;&gt; Right there. &gt;&gt; That's nice. Oh, that's good. &gt;&gt; Have fun with this. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe my mom's so comfortable being naked. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love this process. Kim, I don't know what you're complaining about. This is great. I could do this all day long. I'm loving it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously? &gt;&gt; MELODY THORTON: Hello. Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; MELODY: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; MELODY: Yay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so hungry. What are we going to get, the usual? &gt;&gt; MELODY: Crispy rice is like the first thing I think about, like every day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, I just got a call from <i>Playboy.</i> And they want you to actually do some more photos. What they said was that Hef was really excited about the photo shoot. He loved the pictures. They said that Hef really wants to meet with you. He want to talk to you himself, and he's asked you and I to come to the Playboy Mansion. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. And they want some more... a little... showing a little more skin, actually. &gt;&gt; KIM: I knew it. I knew that they wanted more nude. They want more skin. They want me to take a little more off, and I just thought that I had an amazing shoot. Why do more? Bye. I knew they want... I was like, I'm not taking my top off, I'm not doing this, I'm not doing that. I'm just not that comfortable being nude. &gt;&gt; MELODY: Don't show goodies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I wouldn't. I'm not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian to see Mr. Hefner. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, why are you wearing a push-up bra? This is like not about you trying to get into the magazine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going to the Playboy Mansion. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim and Kris to see Hef. Where's the powder room? Right here? &gt;&gt; Right to your left. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Thank you so much. Go in there and see if there's any soap or anything with "Playboy" on it. It's a souvenir. Take the water bottle. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are practically naked. Pull your top up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sorry. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: Well... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: Hello. What a pleasure. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: My pleasure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. I'm Kris Jenner. How are you? &gt;&gt; HEFNER: It's a pleasure to meet you as well. And this is Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: Well, I know that by reputation. Welcome to the Playboy mansion, and I'm very excited about having you in the December issue. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm very excited. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: Very excited. The great face, the hair, the booty-- I think it will all do very well. &gt;&gt; KIM: Booty. Got it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have one little question. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does she have to take her clothes off? &gt;&gt; HEFNER: Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But no, like... We're not going to show the twins, right? &gt;&gt; HEFNER: That's part of it, but discreetly and in very good taste. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm really conflicted. They want me to show more skin for this new shoot, and I just don't know if this is something I want to do. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: It will not be explicit. That is what sets <i>Playboy</i> apart from the other magazines. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. The best. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: Always... classy. It's for the December issue. We always have a celebrity on the cover, and inside that issue. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that your favorite issue? &gt;&gt; HEFNER: It has to be. I started the magazine with the December 1953 issue... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: And I happened to have Marilyn Monroe on the cover, and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't know that. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: ...inside as the first Playmate of the Month. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow. Knowing that Marilyn Monroe has done it, I feel a little bit more comfortable with it, and I know that I'm going to be taken care of 'cause the <i>Playboy</i> team is so amazing, but it is going to be nerve-racking. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Very nice meeting you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; HEFNER: My pleasure. See you soon. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Oh,! There you go, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, what is this about Kimberly? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I heard that someone from <i>Playboy</i> called her. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I heard they want a little more of something something. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I haven't seen the first photos. I wouldn't know. You know, Kimberly's got to clean up her act. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so nervous. I just want everything to go perfectly. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I just know there wasn't any nudity. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know. Yeah. That was the whole idea of doing the shoot. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm assuming it's <i>Playboy,</i> and they might want to show a little more nudity. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No nudity? Hah! Is that what they told you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, it's one thing I'm her stepdad. It's your sister. How do you feel about all of this? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Whoa, I don't know. It's her decision. I support her whatever she does. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are doing amazing, sweetie. Hot! You are going to die when you see these. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have a lot of diamond fake necklaces? We could bring these. Wait. We could bring these. &gt;&gt; KIM: I come up with this idea that I am totally comfortable being nude if I'm draped in diamonds and pearls. &gt;&gt; Here we go. You want to lean to me. There's what you want to be, like that, like that. That's beautiful, huh? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I'm sure she's not just standing there with her boobs out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's probably posing, and going like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The pose is always like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes! The armpits. That's her dance. &gt;&gt; Let 'em hang, let 'em hang! Yes, yes. There, there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If she sticks her butt out, I bet her stomach goes in more, and her mouth is always open like... Why is her mouth open in every picture? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you're doing amazing, sweetie. &gt;&gt; Push this knee out. Push, push, push, push! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like a cat. Kourtney, take it off! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take your clothes off! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's a good pose! Take it! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Leave me alone! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take it off! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God, Kim, they're beautiful! &gt;&gt; KENDRA: Yeah, they're hot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're really, really cool. &gt;&gt; KENDRA: Hot. That was the one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you're going to die when you see these. &gt;&gt; KIM: Incredible, isn't it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like the shoes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Posing for <i>Playboy</i> was a huge challenge for me, but in the end, I'm so extremely happy that I did it. Hef and his whole team just really were so gracious to me and so welcoming, and I just can't wait to see it. Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you love it? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so gorgeous, you'll die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll get everybody inside. Everybody in here? Okay, Kim has a big surprise. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, no. Is she blonde? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on in, Kim! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's a picture of Kimberly! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What a sexy bi-ahtch! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce loves it. Look at Bruce. He's dying. You like it, honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's really great. It's really great. Very creative. Nicely done. Maybe we should go check it out in the bedroom, see how it works. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Gold medal night. Next time, on <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>with the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm stressed out. I cannot work this much all the time! &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe's acting like a monster. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The anniversary of Daddy's death. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to turn into an alcoholic tonight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to go to jail.
