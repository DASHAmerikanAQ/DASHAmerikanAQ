- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall! Tonight on Keeping Up With the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is gonna be Kanye's music studio? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know you got money when your plans actually have you in them. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye likes to have us in there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is amazing. I got to learn to rap. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was trying to warn Lamar about this paparazzi thing. &gt;&gt; FEMALE VOICE: You're call has been forwarded to an... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been in hiding, 'cause I'm afraid of people, and I'm not even the one who did anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to start packing up, 'cause the lease is up in, like, ten days. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ten days? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ten days. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We both have to admit that the energy between us seems to be better when we're apart. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We need you to understand this, and be okay with it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why are you still married? 21 00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:52,811 If you want to be friends, get a divorce. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited to go blonde. I feel like people go blonde when they want a change. Like, I... Remember when I went blonde when Reggie and I broke up? To be, like, "Uh, I just need a fresh start." You know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just, like, looking at... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Comments? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't look at them. They're gonna be mean people. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, they're all nice. Do you look at your Twitter comments? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not really. Not right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause of Lamar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, all those rumors about him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, who cares? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I was looking at comments about the baby, like, 'cause she's trending, so, I went to her thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: She is? I love... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And everything is positive. People are, like, "The queen is back." Northwest is trending longer than the royal baby or something. : Like, it's like so funny. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love that they've been calling me the queen lately. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, but what am I, your servant? &gt;&gt; KIM: When I was pregnant, I would honestly say, I was so scared, but, now, I love being a mom, and it's just such an undescribable feeling. Oh, my God, George, this looks so good. Like, seriously... Hold on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim and I are into new vibes these days. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's all about new beginnings. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: New beginnings. You should get rid of that bathing suit. It's just not a good look. That crochet-- what year are you in? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's just say, 58 00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:34,528 we're bringing sexy back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh... yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, look who shows up. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What is that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you bring cake? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love the beach hair look. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, man. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're turning into, like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. I'm in Malibu. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you...? What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Arts and crafts? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we have to start packing up, like, your-your really personal stuff, 'cause the lease is up in, like, ten days. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ten days? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ten days. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's kind of sad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's sad? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I have to leave this place. You know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know you like living here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's been kind of... kind of nice. How time flies. My lease is already up on the beach house. It has been such a great getaway. I mean, it's peaceful, no drama. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't like it when people start rumors that are a little crazy. The longer we live apart, the more reason they have to speculate. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Somebody's speculating about our family? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shocking. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Never. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To be honest with you, I-I don't... care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't need any of our friends or family members speculating. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that there is so much speculation about what our relationship is, and I think it might be a good idea to put everybody back under one roof so that we can all just connect again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, if the lease is up, the lease is up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And, uh... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And your ponytail's only getting longer. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can take the, uh, man out of Malibu, but you can't take the Malibu... &gt;&gt; KYLIE &amp; BRUCE: The Malibu out of the man. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm keeping the ponytail. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think it looks hard. The ponytail, ponytail. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You like it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It looks so hard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can go with "hard." Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you're hard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm hard. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Holy What was the point of even buying this place? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For real. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You should have built your own home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what I've said. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I... We liked this actual property, so... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dude, let's spend $20 million on a property. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is crazy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, you literally ripped this whole thing apart like a two-bit whore in Guam. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. I told you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love whores in Guam. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, they're good girls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Boys. &gt;&gt; KIM: We actually are building this all out so that this grass will go out as far as it can go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's sick. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then the pool is gonna be a 70-foot pool this way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Course it is. &gt;&gt; KIM: This... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, so when are you moving in, because this looks like... Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You-you could've built this place, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye and I are still living at my mom's house with the baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I guess you don't have to baby proof-anymore, right? You didn't know how to do that anyway. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She'll be three by the time this thing's working. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it'll be done in June. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's a year. &gt;&gt; KIM: Our house is a huge project, and everyone always says, you know, when you start a project, it'll be double the price, and double the time than what you anticipate, and it honestly is... couldn't be more true of a statement. This is gonna be Kanye's music studio. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know you got money when your plans actually have you in them. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye likes to have us in there, so we, you know... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is amazing. He's about to pee. You're chilling again. You're not cooking, but you're make... pretending you are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yesus and Jesus is over there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, that's normal, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: That is Rick Rubin. That's his studio. This is what his studio's gonna look like. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that looks good. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's his studio. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was trying to warn Lamar about this paparazzi thing, but I did... I don't want to call him, but should I try to call? Why not? &gt;&gt; FEMALE VOICE: Your call has been forwarded to an... &gt;&gt; KIM: You wouldn't wish anyone to be going through what Khloe's going through. She's just, you know, a different person, and I just want her to be happy, and find peace of mind. 157 00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:41,092 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got to learn to rap. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There you go, Your Majesty. Certainly, the driveway's looking a little full. Where the heck is all my stuff gonna go? It's kind of ridiculous, isn't it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's absolutely no room in the garage anymore. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, there's a lot going on here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, there you are. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm fine. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, good, good. Now... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I'm kind of looking at the garage. If I brought my stuff back here, where the heck would it go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a good question. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Excellent question. Thank you. You know, they're working on Kim's house. I know, but they're not doing anything to the garage. They couldn't maybe, like, put the Lamborghini in the garage? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The garage is their work station. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, there's nowhere to put anything. That's why it's all here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Boy, when I moved out, they moved me out. Everybody else has kind of taken that space over with. Honestly, it looks like there's no room for me to come back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I don't know what to say. It's like, I'm a little overwhelmed, too. There's just a lot going on here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everybody's... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And everybody's got cars and motorcycles and strollers and... 189 00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:10,324 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Gotcha. We'll figure it out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh. Want a piece of gum? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, thanks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye, Kim. &gt;&gt; TEAMMATE: Ladies, how are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh... Hi. Kourtney. &gt;&gt; TEAMMATE: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you met Kourt? &gt;&gt; TEAMMATE: Yes, I have before. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; TEAMMATE: I'm well. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, so call me later. &gt;&gt; TEAMMATE: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; TEAMMATE: All right... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That made me so uncomfortable, 'cause I'm, like, friends with him. Like, how fast he just bailed. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Weird? &gt;&gt; KIM: That wasn't weird. The... I think he was just uncomfortable, and didn't want you to feel like he was gonna ask you any Lamar questions. It was... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, I'm friends with him. He bare... He shook my hand, and barely even looked at me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, don't feel weird. I swear, they just probably don't know what to say. And the first run-in, like, had to happen with people like that. You haven't seen anyone, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but that was so weird. Anyway, okay. I love you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That made me so uncomfortable. This whole thing is very uncomfortable. I don't like being around people, 'cause, I know what they're thinking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, so let's make sure there's no people in Dash. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know what the employees are thinking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, why don't you just wait in the car? I'll literally run inside. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's okay. I mean, it's like I... like I have to be around people one day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Is Roya here today? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, she is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, okay, good. &gt;&gt; EMPLOYEES: Hi, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. &gt;&gt; ROYA: So I want to talk to you about the fitting room drapes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROYA: So I ordered a new set. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROYA: Because they cannot be cleaned. And, then, the floor, we're having an issue with. Obviously, you can see. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. What else? We're thinking of opening an office. So like, Roya could do the buying from there. And then, I don't know if you guys know, but we're having a new girl, Dakota, come in, and kind of do the job that Roya's doing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need to re-interview her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should we iChat with her? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. One more time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right now? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? Let's put her on the spot. &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're at Dash. You can see the sign behind us. Are you excited for your two-week trial? &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: Yes. Very excited. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have just hired a retail director for Dash. What were, like, your day-to-day responsibilities? &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: I was there to support the team. And, making sure that they reached their store goals. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're so excited. We've been looking for someone for this position for years, who is going to take over and help run all three stores. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All right. I appreciate you getting on with us so quickly. &gt;&gt; DAKOTA: Very, absolutely. Sorry I look like crap, as I'm on a boat today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think you look cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY &amp; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; ROYA: Bye, you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. 260 00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:23,642 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get ready for some fab... changes. &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZI: Are you going to pick Lamar up from Skid Row tonight, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sweet, right? &gt;&gt; PAPARAZZI: Are you going to Skid Row? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So sweet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whatholes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what happens. I've been in hiding 'cause I'm afraid of people. uncomfortable. I can't look people in the eyes. 269 00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:51,583 And I'm not even the one who did anything. My priority is Lamar's health and well being. And, I don't feel like it's my place to address a lot of things, 'cause it's not. It is part of my job to protect him, and to keep him as safe as possible. And by keeping him safe it's by... keeping me quiet. I've been putting myself aside, to save-- hopefully save-- somebody else's life. And now that I've come to terms that I can't... I have to move on with my life, and... that means, like, changing a lot. Has Lamar tried calling you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He doesn't even probably know Rob's newest number. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah... I definitely think you should move out of that house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have a seat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-oh. I don't if I like, "have a seat". &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think it's important we discuss what's going on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People think I'm like... And I shouldn't care what people think. But I don't like that now I'm affiliated... It's so like, so weird that everyone just expects me... Like, I haven't even had one week off. KOURTNEY: Why don't you tell someone you need two weeks off, at least? KHLOE: It's not two weeks. Like, I need to get my life in order. But then I'm like, I love to work 'cause it distracts me. But then as soon as I go home 297 00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:52,862 I'm like a shattered person. Like, I'm just wasting time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like you don't need to decide everything at once, too. Like about your house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. But, like, what am I supposed to do until then? 303 00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,612 Like, where am I supposed to live? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you and Lamar have that conversation? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't have a conversation with him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know that this is a really intense and sad time for Khloe. And I feel so bad. I just really don't know what to do. Have you not been talking to him? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-uh. What-What is there to say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I guess he called Malika to say, "please tell Kris and Bruce I'm sorry." Oh, shut up. 315 00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:42,569 Tell Khloe you'resorry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Robbie. I like your place. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where'd you get all the CÄĹ˝roc from? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Buffy. 320 00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:07,305 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob moved out of Khloe and Lamar's house. I'm actually really proud of Rob, that he's getting his own place and just having a little bit more responsibility and just doing things on his own. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm. I miss you. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you wearing? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Um... Unbreakable. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you wearing Unbreakable? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Well, I just got all these... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It makes me so sad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are Skittles on your diet? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No. Actually, I need to throw those out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know I cried? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You picked everything out? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, I cried yesterday. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I still had to... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know I cried yesterday, 'cause I went in your room, and you were gone. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I told you, you can sleep in one of the rooms. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have no one at my house. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You can sleep here. house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I couldn't be happier for Rob getting his own place and, you know, just growing up. I definitely feel bad that my brother had to live in an environment that he would describe as toxic. So I'm happy he is doing his own thing, and in a healthier environment. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, that's cool. Dad's things that he wrote you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've never seen that? It used to be hanging at my house. Has Lamar tried calling you? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No. I heard he changed his number, didn't he? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, he has prepaid phones 'cause he's convinced all the other ones are... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but he doesn't even probably know Rob's newest number. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He gets a prepaid one and he gets, he only gets it prepaid for a few hours, and then he gets a new one. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah... I definitely 356 00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:41,344 think you should move out of that house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on, honey? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom, I was just gonna ask you if you were helping with the kids one day? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I-I thought I was doing Sunday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. We're home Sunday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll ask Khloe first. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you too, honey. Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hm? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have a seat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-oh. I don't know if I like "have a seat." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think it's important, that uh... we discuss what's going on. We both have to admit that the energy between us seems to be, you know, better when we're apart right now. We've been together for 23 years. It seems to be, now, we're doing, you know, we're doing better being apart. And seeing each other here and there. I already called the real estate agent, and, uh, extended the lease. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you think we should have talked about that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Um... yeah, I just did it. I just... To be honest with you, 381 00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:06,837 at this point, I just can't see going back. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, the other day, I overheard mom at 4:00 in the morning, talking about Khloe and Lamar. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel bad if she can't talk to us. &gt;&gt; KIM: It, like, really breaks my heart. If I think about it long enough, I could cry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's, like, six people living in the house. I've got no space whatsoever. You know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What is this? 391 00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:33,676 Are we divorced parents' kids, now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just... To be honest with you, at this point, I just can't see going back. We just both seem to be doing better with our space. I'm not looking to get divorced or anything. But having our space is kind of nice. 'Cause you look at marriage today. I mean, it's... Kourtney and Scott, they're not even married-- they got two kids, you know? You look... Kim, got a baby, you know? And why should we feel pressure from the media and public opinion to define our marriage? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think Kris is happier being in the other house with me not being there. I-I seem to be happier staying in the Malibu house. If everybody's happy, why not go that direction? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to define our marriage the way we want it to be. You know, I thought about this for a long time and wondered where this is all going. And I think we just both need to be happy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really do. I mean... Isn't that the bottom line? Like, life is so short. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yep. I'm turning 64. You know? I'm playing in the fourth quarter. You know? Of life and... Yeah. I-I just... All I want, you know? We've been very blessed in our lives. Kids and family and all that kind of stuff. I don't want to blow it because the two of us are at each other's throat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: As long as it's a good thing and it's healthy for the family and Bruce is happy and the kids are happy, then this is gonna work out. Do you know that, like, 60 people a year die from getting this thing, like, popped in their head or their eye? : So don't aim it at me. 'Cause I don't want to die... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...from drinking a bottle... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I get everything? All right, are you ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This freaks me out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To the Malibu house. Oh, we-we got to shoot it. Here it goes. Boom. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How'd you shoot it like that? That was pretty good, Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, thank you. Obviously, my biggest concern is Kendall and Kylie. That's, like, my next conversation. I don't want to rush it, you know I mean? I want to... give me a little time. I'm gonna figure out... I want to make sure I do it right, 439 00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,961 because, you know, they're my only concern. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, hello, Gorgina. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just wanted to get away and just... relax for a little bit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I haven't watched in so long. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You haven't? This is the best episode. The grape episode. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She looks like a Dolce &amp; Gabbana ad. Scoot over. I wonder how many years they filmed this show. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you okay? Do you want to talk about anything? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Since Rob moved out, Khloe's been staying at my mom's a little bit. And I've told her that she could come stay at my house whenever she wants to. You know, I just feel bad that she's carrying around so much stress. Isn't it crazy that you stomp grapes like that and then people drink it? Like, what if... How do you clean your feet? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm sure they have ways. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at all this. Good job on bringing the sushi, Kylie. Got anything to drink? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What's that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie's. Thank you. I've really enjoyed it, being out here, with all the commotion that's going on at the other house. Every time I go back, it's like... I mean, there's, like, six people living in the house. I've got no space whatsoever. I get a little corner in the garage. I think I've been partially happier out here, kind of out of that house. And I just want you guys to be comfortable with that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dude, what is this? Are we divorced parents' kids now? Like, I'm so, like, confused. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. Mom and I are doing just great. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, but I don't want to live like I'm... have divorced parents. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, we're not getting divorced. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why do you care about being alone out here so much, when your wife and kids, 481 00:23:27,543 --> 00:23:31,315 who are still growing up, are in Hidden Hills. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Over the years, I haven't been treated that well over there. I get up in the morning-- I'm scrutinized what I wear, what I do this, what I say. And you've seen it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I agree. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You would agree? Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think if you're happier for yourself out here, then you should be out here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think it sucks that my dad wants to live in Malibu because I love to see him every day. But I feel like if he's happier there, then I'm definitely happier. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The bottom line is, is Mom and I are doing just fine. We seem to be doing better and both of us happier with some distance. We love each other. I love you guys. We're still the family. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Even though my dad says him and my mom are fine, I'm still kind of having my doubts, wondering if that's true or not, and I can kind of assume what's gonna happen, and I'm not really looking forward to it. Do what you want. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris and I are kind of deciding what we want to do in the future and where we want to go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Then why are you still married? If you want to be friends, get a divorce. running a huge story on Bruce and I tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Saying what? Gossip stories are now gonna pin my mom and Bruce against each other, and that's just what's so hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dinner looks so good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, you're actually hitting her. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom! Mom! Help me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What-what are we all doing? Something's happening. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're just gonna go have a family meeting. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, let's go in the den, everybody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm getting scared. I don't really know what's happening. Seeing that Bruce is here was alarming because Bruce hasn't been here in a while. Oh, my God, Scott's here, too? We're definitely... Something is happening. What is happening? And then for Rob to be here, too? 'Cause Rob, like, never does anything we tell him to do. This is just, like, getting weird, and I'm getting very paranoid and I just am freaked out. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You want to start this off? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you can. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the hell's going on here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, we brought the family meeting together, kind of go through the status of your mother and I and kind of where we're at. Kris and I are kind of deciding what we want to do in the future and where we want to go, and both Mom and I seem to be very happy with the arrangement that we have right now. 537 00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:36,755 So, for the time being, we're gonna keep the, uh, beach house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where does that stand for you two? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nobody's getting a divorce, nobody's doing anything right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just think we both decided we just always want to be, first and foremost, family and friends. &gt;&gt; KIM: But don't you think that living apart too long will make you guys really enjoy that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I said that way before they even did this. Upstairs in Mom's closet, I said, "Too much time apart is, like... That's where you get comfortable." &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we're fine with that, and w... We need you to understand this and be okay with it. We're better as friends than we are the other way. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: So then why are you still married? Get a divorce. Why are you scared of getting a divorce? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're not scared of that; it just takes a minute to get used to it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, you are. Get a divorce if that's... If you want to be friends, get a divorce. Why are you still together? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you so angry? Does it bother you that they're still married? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Because they're obviously hiding it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think she's bothered that they're sugarcoating the living situation and there's a bigger picture. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, yeah, it bugs me that you guys are, like, trying to, like, hide something that everyone can obviously see. I'm tired of dancing around the subject, and I want to know what's going on. I'm tired of guessing and wondering. I just really want to know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney and Kimberly probably remember that when Daddy and I got divorced, there was a lot of tension. We need to do it our way, and if it means we're gonna get divorced, we'll tell you right away. We're trying to figure that out. The process isn't fun. It sucks on a lot of levels. You know, I just... I don't want to get crazy. 574 00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,546 I just didn't want this to turn into an emotional thing. I think that what I'm saying is, it's just... You know, it's-it's... We're trying to be honest. You guys want honesty, and we're trying to be really honest, and our feelings are our feelings, and they're our feelings together. We're just doing it our way. It doesn't mean that we still can't be in each others' lives. We have kids together. He loves you guys very much, all of you, and so do I. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're always here for you guys. We always have been, and we always will be. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think none of us want you guys to get a divorce, but we do want you guys to be happy, and so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not happy, and he's not happy, so thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, okay. You don't have to yell, like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: But that's all that you need to say. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let us do our thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop yelling at me, or I'm gonna start yelling at you. Seriously, don'tyell at me. 594 00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:22,100 Don'twith me, 'cause I'm the wrong one. &gt;&gt; MAN: Bruce! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There's four of 'em sitting right there in the tree. &gt;&gt; MAN: Do you get to keep the Porsche? &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Hey, Bruce. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're on private property. Get theout of here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, didn't you call this meeting? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I actually did. I just think we should all be on the same page. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What is the page? &gt;&gt; KIM: There's already been so many stories that say, like, the boys are so happy that they're 606 00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:49,807 getting separated. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop yelling at me, or I'm gonna start yelling at you. Seriously. Don'tyell at me. We want you guys to be happy. I think just, sometimes you guys aren't willing to admit things to yourselves until it's that time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to do it as mature adults, because, you know what? Life is too short. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Then we won't be siblings anymore. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's not true. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not true. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it's not true! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, don't cry. I am very, very protective over Kendall and Kylie. For Kendall to say that we're not gonna be sisters anymore-- that really, really effects me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's your half sister and brother. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We have the same blood. Well, I don't know about me, but they have the same blood. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's no bad blood. My mom and Bruce do get along. I really do think they're better just living apart. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, thank you for explaining that to us. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ultimately, I think they're making the right decision, because I think life is all about being happy, and I think everyone just deserves to be happy. And no matter what happens, I mean, Bruce is still our dad. You know, he raised us since I was, like, 11 years old. That'll never change. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're always gonna be sisters. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm definitely Team Bruce over Team Kris. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You didn't know that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you guys care if you guys date other people? I'm asking. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my God. 638 00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:25,347 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nobody's... No, I don't... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: But we're always here for you, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know. &gt;&gt; ROB: And as the man of this house, I say that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There you go, Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, Rob. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There you go. Way to step up. &gt;&gt; KIM: You should work out with me and my trainer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What time? &gt;&gt; KIM: We did 7:30 this morning. I have to do it very strategically. With the feeding, she has to feed between 9:00 and 9:30. So, the other day, I overheard Mom at 4:00 in the morning talking about Khloe and Lamar. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe is going through so much, and sometimes I don't know what to do to help her. As a family, we just need to be there for Khloe and help her figure out whatever her next step is, and that's all we can do. I just feel bad if she's going through something alone and feels like she can't talk to us. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, 'cause does she think we're gonna...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Judge her? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just feel like Khloe has taken years to open up to someone, to really fall in love, and this is, like, the first time she's really been in love. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, for real, so to have that all not work out the way she hoped it would, I think would just be so sad for her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. It, like, really breaks my heart. If I think about it long enough, I could cry, bible. I'll cry at the end of the day 667 00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:06,631 with not-fresh makeup. running a huge story on Bruce and I tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Saying what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Saying that we're living apart, which, I feel like everybody knows anyway, but just our comments, 'cause Bruce and I made a statement. &gt;&gt; KIM: What did you say? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We said that we are happier this way and that we really love and respect each other, and we're best friends, and we always will be, and we talk three times a day on the phone. It was like two sentences. I don't want it to be crazy, especially when it's innocent. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've definitely had my fair share of the press attacking me, and I feel like gossip stories are now gonna start, and they're gonna try and pin my mom and Bruce against each other, and that's just what's so hard. But I think, together as a family, we just have to, you know, stick together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't see because of the sun. 686 00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:17,936 It's crazy. I'm going. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I need to have a serious talk with you about this ponytail. I really need it gone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Within the next day. Seriously, you need to... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love the ponytail. Don't you like the ponytail? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. Take the ponytail out. Come on now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. It's just growing in. God! &gt;&gt; MAN: Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You wore shoes like that to hit golf balls? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yup. I'm probably not gonna hit any golf balls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, come on, you got to hit some golf balls. Here you go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Not when they're gonna take snapshots of me be... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, I think they're leaving. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, they're not. &gt;&gt; MAN: Bruce! Do you get to keep the Porsche? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There's four of 'em sitting right there in the tree. They will never leave. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The most difficult thing in all of this is not dealing with Kris or the kids or the family. We can all deal with that. It's the stupid media, and the paparazzis can drive you absolutely crazy. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Hey, Bruce. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So help me, I'll hit that thing. &gt;&gt; MAN: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, so put it down. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: You know, the view's up on the street. &gt;&gt; MAN 3: Don't move. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. Listen, you... listen, youbottom feeders... &gt;&gt; MAN: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get theout of here? You're on private property. We just called the cops. So you can both get the out of here. 719 00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:42,093 You hear me? Get theout of here! &gt;&gt; BRODY: How is Lamar? Where is he living? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He stays at our loft. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Poor guy. Poor you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You hear me? Get theout of here. Now I feel better. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yay! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I so want to just give 'em the finger right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I... I was going to earlier. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Should the three of us do it right now-- give 'em the finger? Do you give us permission? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Why not? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One, two, three. Give it go 'em. you guys. Hey! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That was so fun! Despite everything, I really appreciate that my dad is taking the time to make sure Kylie and I are okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is how you do it. No, don't over there. You're inter... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I want to be on yours. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get over there. You've got your own balls. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And I know that he'll always be there for me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, get your butt over here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, Dad. You know I don't know how to golf. Trying to make me feel better. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got to practice. You got to start some time. Come on, there's nothing hotter than a girl that can play golf. I'll prove it to you. Guys, is there anything hotter in life than a chick that can hit the ball? &gt;&gt; MAN: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Absolutely not. See? Every time! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who misses me? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We do! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on. Here I am. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. Where's the ponytail? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't encourage. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Things haven't changed. You're dressed in black and, again, she's got a glass of wine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! What a shock. You guys, can we go... all go outside? 'Cause it's so beautiful out there and we'll go sit out on the pavilion? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is Rob coming to this meeting or no? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, Rob is at the doctor getting a physical. I think it's just because he gained weight in a really short amount of time. His liver was almost gone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And his ser... He has no serotonin. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, crazy levels that make you depressed. They think that there's a bigger reason why he gained 65 pounds in a couple months. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Wow. Poor guy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just so sad. It's sad. &gt;&gt; BRODY: How's Lamar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's okay. Um, I talked to him today. I just dropped him off, like... He asked for, like, just... like, underwear and, like, just basics. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Where is he living? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He stays in our loft. Downtown. But he, like, wanted to go see a movie today. Like, he was in good spirits today. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did he go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He wanted to go with me. I said I can't. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Poor guy. Poor you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, didn't you call this meeting? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kim called the meeting? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I actually did. My mom and Bruce expressed that they're getting a separation, and there's already been so many stories that say, like, the boys don't like my mom... and they're so happy that they're getting separated. I just think we should all be on the same page. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What is the page? What's the page? What's-what's the page, guys? What-What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Even if they are fake stories, I know that sometimes, 787 00:38:59,952 --> 00:39:03,757 if you hear it enough, you will believe it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just think we should all be on the same page. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What is the page? What's the page, guys? You got to tell. What-What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just saw, like, over the weekend that, obviously, since you guys announced your separation or whatever, I feel like there's just been so many stories, which was, like, bound to happen, but I feel like we should have maybe gotten ahead of it. As soon as my mom and Bruce expressed that this is what they were gonna do, we should've had a family meeting with all the Jenner kids, too, because I didn't even think about it, but of course there's gonna be crazy stories and rumors that get out there. Obviously, we can't control other people. All we can control is ourselves. So don't believe any of it. It's gonna say, you know, "This one hates this one, this one hates this one." Now they're gonna, like, try and just say that, like, we're not close with our stepbrothers. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You know, the-the truth is, Kendall and Kylie, they're the most important thing in all of this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. We've all been through our parents getting a divorce, so we obviously know what it feels like. So I think if we're all... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Also, we've never experienced it on their level. Like, we've done it privately. They have to experience it with everyone putting in their two cents. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You guys grew up, like, for the most part, completely normal. Like, we've grown up, at our age, like, in a different light than you guys have. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. No, totally. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And that has to suck. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I like that you guys understand that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to just stay together as a family, keep connected and make sure that we communicate. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right now there are so many things going on in our family. It's just ridiculous. But, hey, we've dealt with a lot more difficult things in the past. Eh, it's gonna be tough for everybody but, you know what, our family's strong. We will survive. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, in all seriousness, it's very good that you guys are very adult about this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So if we're all so okay with it, why can't everybody else be so okay with it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No one should give aabout media coverage. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Whoa! Whoa! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Family united, I agree. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, aren't you excited to be here? So beauteous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it really is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're gonna stomp I Love Lucy. &gt;&gt; HOWARD: Welcome, welcome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; HOWARD: Welcome to Malibu Rocky Oaks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe is going through so much, and sometimes I don't know what to do to help her. But she always makes me laugh in my toughest times. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, who is that? Kendall! Kendall! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's romantic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And that's all I can do for her, is make sure that she laughs and has a good time while she's dealing with everything. I Love Lucy swoop? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't let your vag hang out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like that. Wait, do we have to wash our feet? &gt;&gt; HOWARD: No, you're good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, stomp like Lucy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yolanda and Towanda. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yolanda and Towanda. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, we have to decide who's who. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are these names that you guys have? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yolanda and Towanda are mine and Kourtney's alter egos. They are who we want to be when we just want to be wild and crazy. Kourtney, what are you do... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't splash. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney... One of the best things about having a big family is no matter what we're going through, we're always there for each other, and there's nothing better that I would rather have, especially right now, than a big family. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How does this turn into wine? I still don't get it. &gt;&gt; HOWARD: Well, we put in the yeast and then it starts the fermentation process. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm, put in the yeast, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should I open my legs? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is so disgusting. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: You need to have some hobbies that help your anxiety. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I thought karate would be a good activity, but it's kind of weirding me out a bit. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you been to one of his classes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello, Sonoma! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: To our new friendship. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're in Beverly Hills. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't understand why you guys would lie to me. Hi, Lamar. You okay? Just know we're always here to support you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think Khloe would be able to forgive him if he tried 881 00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:44,976 to get his life in order for her.
