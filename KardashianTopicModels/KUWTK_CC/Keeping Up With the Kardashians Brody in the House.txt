- &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; JOE FRANCIS: Kris, hey, it's Joe Francis. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Joe Francis. Where are you, honey? &gt;&gt; JOE: I'm in jail. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're still in jail? &gt;&gt; JOE: I am still in jail. I can't believe it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my gosh. Joe, we need to come get you out. I'm coming over there. What can we do? &gt;&gt; JOE: Well, we launched the line for the new Ashley Paige for <i>Girls Gone Wild</i> swimwear, and I want the girls to possibly be the spokesmodels. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; JOE: Yeah, I'd like to do billboards, a print campaign. This is like a huge thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It sounds really exciting. I just can't believe you have time to do this from jail, but... &gt;&gt; JOE: Well, there's not... Kris, there's not much to do in jail. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sometimes people have a negative connotation about <i>Girls Gone Wild,</i> but this bikini line is so fabulous, high-end couture bikini line. &gt;&gt; JOE: I'd like to send you guys down to my house in Puerto Vallarta. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. That would be so great. I think all of us could use a trip to Mexico. Okay, I have good news. Joe Francis called and wants you girls to do and be the spokesperson for his new bikini line. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's been thinking about the Kardashians in jail? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And he wants you girls to go down to his house, Casa Aramara, all courtesy of <i>Girls Gone Wild.</i> &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The casa? &gt;&gt; KIM: We carry Ashley Paige in our store and it's really cool. The line's amazing. And I'm excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He wants to do a billboard, like on Sunset. &gt;&gt; KIM: As soon as I get a bikini wax, I'm down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney does it herself. She's a He-Man woman hater. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're still doing your wax by yourself? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, honey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does Bruce know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know why Bruce would care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's really conservative. He's going to have a problem that you guys are posing in bikinis. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're in swimsuits. We're not, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're not, like, in lingerie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I don't want to just upset him for no reason. So let's just not make a big deal out of it so he doesn't go crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We'll leave Bruce up to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, we'll leave Bruce up to you, 'cause none of us... We're just not going to say a thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't want him to get upset one more time. He doesn't, you know... &gt;&gt; KIM: His heart can't take it. He's getting too old. &gt;&gt; Well I was just talking to the girls and we were thinking that maybe we would go and have a little getaway to Puerto Vallarta. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Puerto Vallarta? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you know, we were thinking we'd have another one of our little girls' trips. Bruce and I have a great marriage and a great dynamic, but sometimes things just work out better if he doesn't know every single detail. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think it doesn't make any difference what I think, so I'm going to go with, "Have a wonderful time." But you got to be back in time 'cause I have to leave on a trip. Oh, yeah, right, suck up to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Joe Francis has the most beautiful airplane. It seats 12, it's absolutely gorgeous and there's no security check, no lines and nobody to tell you what you can and can't do. A toast to a great family "vaca" and a fabulous photo shoot and Bruce not finding out. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, there's a spider on you. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, there's not, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I swear. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Get it off of her! Get it off, Mom! Please get it off of her! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Get it off, Mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, I'm going to cry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop. Stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, is there really a spider on me? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No, it's not. It's... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's gone. &gt;&gt; KIM: In my sweater. Is there a spider in the sweater? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, the little drama queen. She needs all of that attention. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm fat enough, I don't need to be put on steroids because I got a big spider bite. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, guys, it's going to be all right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's go see the house. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Love the lighting. Oh, wow! &gt;&gt; KIM: This is so beautiful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So Mom's eating tacos, you think, in Mexico? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Pretty much. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you think she's doing down there? &gt;&gt; Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Jump in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! What's most important now, is that you guys look your best tomorrow. You've got a big day. So let's go to bed. Come on, guys, let's go. Makeup and hair is set up already. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What the? I have to get up at 6:00 a.m.? I needbeauty rest. Ashley has lost her mind. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Five more minutes. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Ooh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See... I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Take you out. See what you got. Let's see what you got. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brody's busy, he's working. So it's great when he comes over to the house and we spend a little time, and I kind of hear what's going on in his life. So what have you been up to? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Just chillin'. That's a lot better than mine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Easy game. But see, I work at it, Bro, you don't work at it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: How do you feel about Kim being in Puerto Vallarta at <i>Girls Gone Wild?</i> &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're doing what?! &gt;&gt; BRODY: She told me she's doing some swimsuit modeling thing down there for <i>Girls Gone</i> <i>Wild.</i> &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; BRODY: You really didn't know about this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I didn't. I thought they were just going down there for, you know, like a vacation. Why would Kris want to really lie about what's going on down there? I'm going to call them. Find out what's going on. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have to have hair and makeup done. It's, you know, three girls, and it's been takinghours. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I wonder if she can receive messages 'cause I'm leaving a message. Honey, it's me. You don't tell me what's going on. Doing, like, swimsuit pictures. I'm on my way down there. The most frustrating thing in my life is dealing with Kris. You know what, she doesn't tell me everything. I don't know what's going on. What are you doing? Can you watch these kids? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I've got to go. I got plans. Can I watch this crazy...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've got to help me out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would you tell her to wear the sarong? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just to cover her jiggly ass when we're walking around. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:She doesn't have a jiggly ass. It's fine. Her ass makes money, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: My jiggle is out for the world to see. There's no covering it, honey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney is such a bitch. 20 minutes before this photo shoot and she's already giving Kim a complex? I will beat her ass and give her acomplex. Do not break her confidence because you will fail so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I said Kim looks great, her stomach looks flat. I just said... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but it looks cellulite-y. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...cover your butt. No, your stomach doesn't look cellulite-y. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it doesn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: It looks like I have cellulite all there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it doesn't. I just said... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just stand like that. I got yo' back, honey, anytime you need it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Guys, I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You out of here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brod, this is scary for me to say. You're in charge. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I was thinking, "What is this?" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, and both you girls better be good. Probably the most important thing in my life is to protect these girls. I mean, you see what happened with Kim and her sex tape. They really have to watch what they're doing because just a little thing can get totally blown out of proportion. &gt;&gt; Okay, stand up. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY PAIGE: This is it, guys, this is it. That's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Our first shot is on the beach with this huge sand castle that's spray-painted green. It is supposed to be really glamour, over-the-top. &gt;&gt; Okay, all right. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: All right. &gt;&gt; Okay, come on, let's go. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Let's do it. Ready? Ready, guys? Sexy, comfortable. &gt;&gt; Let's do it again. I love it right there, that's beautiful. Hold that. &gt;&gt; Got to see the coconut. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Yes, oh, I love it, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; Okay, right there, let's do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can I talk to you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The photo shoot is a wrap, I guess. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why do you guys lie to me like this all the time? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, What are you doing here? Can I talk to you? Let's go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The photo shoot is a wrap, I guess. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why do you guys lie to me like this all the time? I mean, you said you were coming down here for what, a girl's weekend, and you're doing this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, we were go... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, Brody tells me that you're down here doing some <i>Girls Gone Wild</i> video. I left him there with the kids; that's how bad it got. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everybody stops and I am so embarrassed because I can just feel the tension in the air, and I know Bruce is going to go ballistic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ashley is very classy... &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: I don't do anything distasteful... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and she will make sure that we are classy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, look at Khloe. That's, that's classy. That's real classy, Khloe. Why don't you ever talk to me? Why don't you tell me what's going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're so conservative. You're always on us to just behave a certain way... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, the high road is always the good road. Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're not doing anything wrong or explicit or crazy or... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I had a long trip. I'm going to go take a shower. I'll see you in a bit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Glad you're here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do you want to play dress-up? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm not putting your little pink hat on. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes, you are! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Take the hat off. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Ow! Can you relax for five minutes? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We have to go in my room. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm gonna rip one of these dolls' heads off. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Let's go, brother from another mother. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Can you just leave me alone for five minutes? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ready? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I have a question to ask both of you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Why do you want to tie me up to a stripper pole? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause you're being a bad boy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's also for suffocating you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, what, what happened? I got my-- oh, hey. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're not done yet. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You guys are bad at that. Okay, no more stripper pole. &gt;&gt; KENDALL &amp; KYLIE: Yes! &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, I-- come on. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm serious! &gt;&gt; BRODY: I played your little game on the stripper pole. I'm over it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Brody, stop it! &gt;&gt; BRODY: I just heard the doorbell ring. Doorbell, yes. Hey, let go of my shirt, hey, hey. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm answering, I'm answering. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yes, please, go answer it. Yes! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Sorry, Brody's not here. &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: I see him right there with-- what's that pink hat? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My hat. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I thought you were going to bring over some chicks. &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: I thought you had chicks here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh... here they are. &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey, you guys, mess with him for a little while. I'm just going to lay down real quick. &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: No, n-n-no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nice glasses. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What's your name? &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: I'm Frankie. How are you doing? Brody! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Frankie. &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: Look who's trying to hit me. Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce. Um, I know that you're mad, but I just wanted to say that, um... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What did you want to say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know that we would never do anything that would make us look not classy, and, you know, we're just not like that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But, you know, in today's society, with kind of a wild and crazy media and all this... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...you got to watch what you do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, 'cause you'll pay dearly on the Internet and all that junk out there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've got to dearly watch what you do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is very tasteful, what we're doing. You know, Ashley Paige is really respectful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The problem is, primarily with your mother, that, you know, she's telling me that, you know, they were going away on a girl's weekend. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. No, and I get it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And instead, you know, you're working down here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I mean I don't think that she should have lied to you, but I think that she did lie because she just felt that you would have said, "No, no, no, you guys can't do it." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When has that ever stopped you? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let's go by, let's go to the pool. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Whoo! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Pool, whoo! &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: Pool time! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Come on, let's go, let's go. &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Whoo! &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: Pool time, pool time. One at a time. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, be careful. &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: Pool, pool, pool. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I was just saying... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yay! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey! I didn't know they were going to do that. &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, wait, she knows how to get in. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Go, quick, Kendall! &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: Aw, man. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let's go hide, let's go hide. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where'd they go? : Brody. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Hey! Hey! Hey! Ow! &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: We're losing our shot. &gt;&gt; We're losing light. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Please tell me you're almost done. &gt;&gt; We're losing light. &gt;&gt; She's almost done. Just this last nail. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have been shooting all day long. You know, working our little asses off. &gt;&gt; I'm nervous that we haven't got it yet. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: Let's make sure we get this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ashley wants it done so fast that she's, you know, telling the photographer to do this and ends up taking his little digital camera and starts snapping her own candids. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: I could do what I wanna do. I'm the designer. &gt;&gt; I'll be setting the next shot. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: I hate it. &gt;&gt; Really? Why? &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: It's not me. I don't like it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ashley Paige is driving us all so insane. She's stressing all of us out. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: All we need is Kim right here. &gt;&gt; Okay so let's go and get Kim. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: I can't keep up with these girls. There are like three of 'em. They're all over the place. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ashley Paige is insane. I'm ready to shove a taco up her ass. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wanna work with a ... designer, you psychotic freak. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What's <i>Girls Gone Wild</i> again? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Who told you about <i>Girls Gone Wild?</i> &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Isn't it that thing where like they lift their shirts? Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I did that. &gt;&gt; BRODY: If I see you lift up your shirt one more time, talk about <i>Girls Gone Wild,</i> you're gonna be grounded. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Woo, woo, woo. It's more like a belly button show. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: <i>Girls Gone Wild.</i> <i>Girls Gone Wild.</i> &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: Hold on, hold on, no, no, no. I gotta shoot this. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you recording? &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: I'll shoot it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: <i>Girls Gone Wild...</i> is like this... Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: You girls are a little crazy but, you know what? I'm gonna start managing you girls. We're gonna put this like on YouTube or something 'cause it's gonna be amazing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What theare you doing?! &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: It's their reel, bro. They need a reel. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Turn that thing off! You are not managing my little sister on a stripper pole... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes! &gt;&gt; BRODY: ...and as I come in-- &gt;&gt; FRANKIE: I'm doing their reel. &gt;&gt; BRODY: As I come in I hear, as I come in I hear... : We're gonna put this on YouTube or something. No! No, stop, stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: What?! &gt;&gt; Yeah, isn't that weird? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's the end of the day, we all look like crap and... &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like we got it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ashley's saying that the billboard shot has not even been done yet. So we're kind of freaked out. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: We haven't got it yet. You guys, come get in the water! Have them splashing each other and drowning each other towards the end. Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, Khloe and I are about to pass out. Hopefully we will pull together our inner Beyonce and get the shot that Ashley wants. &gt;&gt; Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We've been working and shooting all day long. So, I really hope we have Ashley's billboard shot because it's too late to do anything now anyways. &gt;&gt; Hey, Ash. &gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; God, I'm nauseous, literally nauseous. &gt;&gt; Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; Do you have any of us lying on the thing? &gt;&gt; Uh... &gt;&gt; I love-- &gt;&gt; Love that! &gt;&gt; Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; Everyone looks so good in that picture. &gt;&gt; Scroll more. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; Khloe with the coconut. &gt;&gt; That's it right there. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: I really like this for the billboard. &gt;&gt; You got it. &gt;&gt; That is amazing! &gt;&gt; KIM: Perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you feel more-- like better now? &gt;&gt; KIM: We found our shot. We know we got the billboard and we're just so relieved. Thanks for everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was so fun. &gt;&gt; ASHLEY: You guys were really good sports. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't believe my wife of 16 years lied to me. This really upsets me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! Where have you been? I've looked for you everywhere. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I went for a walk. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I went for a walk, I talked to Kourtney. Um, you know, mainly it comes down to you. You know, you guys take off like this and, um, you know I find out other things are going on and it bothers me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's my fault because I wasn't honest with you and I didn't tell you-- You know, you're so used to us girls coming down here for a little R &amp; R... &gt;&gt; BRUCE I don't want to hash it all over again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really feel sick over this whole situation. And I've really realized that I should never lie to my husband again. And I'm really sorry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, we move on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're kind of stinky. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I haven't had my shower yet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, come on upstairs and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll help you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You'll help me with the shower? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Best shower you ever had. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's nice to be down here in Puerto Vallarta, but you know what? I can't help but think of what's going on back at the house. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That was very nice of you. We had a great time. Thank you for all your hospitality. &gt;&gt; Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys, we're home! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yes! &gt;&gt; Mommy! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We are back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Brody looks really happy to see us. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I haven't changed for two days. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How'd you hold up? &gt;&gt; BRODY: These two are a handful. Oh, wait, I mean, no, they're angels, they're angels. Geez. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The girls seem to be fine but Brody seems to be really beat up. It looks like he's had enough and ready to go back to his own life. Girls, would you like Brody every weekend? &gt;&gt; Every day! &gt;&gt; BRODY: On that note, on that... &gt;&gt; Every day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Brody. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Every day. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, good seeing you, too. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Okay, bye. I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Joe. It's so like <i>Charlie's Angels.</i> &gt;&gt; JOE: Angels, Charlie's in jail. &gt;&gt; KIM: Guys, we have to breakout Charlie from jail. It's our duty. &gt;&gt; JOE: You want tp come break me out, drive on up. Pull up a pickup to the back and I'll jump on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like you can't say that while you're there. Won't they get scared? &gt;&gt; JOE: Yeah, I really think that the government's gonna buy the Kardashian girls coming and breaking me out of jail. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am so good at breaking people out. Wait, how did you like the pictures, do you think we're sexy? &gt;&gt; JOE: I think you're so hot. I wish I was there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What about me? Aren't I the prettiest one? &gt;&gt; JOE: Yes, Khloe, you're the prettiest one. &gt;&gt; KIM: Joe, I-- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can you have visitors? Why don't we come visit you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why don't we all come visit you. Can you have like five, four visitors at a time? &gt;&gt; JOE: You know, I kind of like talking to you guys like Charlie. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Charlie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, we love that you're Charlie and we're your angels. &gt;&gt; JOE: Let's go, girls. I'll be outta here pretty soon. Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; ALL: We love you, Charlie. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, what's this? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: <i>Girls Gone Wild...</i> is like this... Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!

Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; KIM: Next time on <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>With the Kardashians...</i> &gt;&gt; This is Michelle calling from <i>Playboy.</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it would be an awesome experience for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you guarantee that I'm not gonna have to take my clothes off? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's got a sex tape out and now she's doing <i>Playboy?</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not comfortable taking my top off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does she have to take her clothes off? &gt;&gt; HUGH HEFNER: Oh, yes. That's part of it.
