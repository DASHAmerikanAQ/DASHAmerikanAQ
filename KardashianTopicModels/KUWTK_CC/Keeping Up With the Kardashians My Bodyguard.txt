- &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. Yummy. What are you making? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am making a face mask. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A what? No, you're not. &gt;&gt; KIM: I looked up online these really good, like, anti-aging face masks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, I need that. Will you hand me a napkin, like, a paper towel? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you have to lay down and do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: On the counter? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Will you lift me up? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're much heavier than you were last year at this time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Last year at this time... okay. Ow! Oh, my God! Khloe, you got it in my hair! Khloe, I said not in my hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, it's... there. It was just a dry potato part. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh! Khloe, did you just get that in my hair? No, seriously, we're gonna have to stop this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got a little in your hair, but underneath. I'm gonna make you a unicorn. Never seen one before. &gt;&gt; KIM: Does this look weird? What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm making a unicorn. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I don't want to be a unicorn, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now you're gonna get it in your hair yourself. This is ridic. Yep, that's normal. &gt;&gt; Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just stretching. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, listen, what I wanted to talk to you about today was securing some great security full-time for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. I don't need it, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everywhere Kim goes these days, there's hordes of fans and commotion. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN: Can I get an autograph? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Kim has been asked by QuickTrim to appear at the Indy 500, where there's hundreds of thousands of fans, and I'm really afraid to put her out there without any personal security. Do you remember that guy in Australia-- Shengo? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's who we need for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely not! Shengo is my security guard from Australia that I met when I was out there working. He was just really quiet and standoffish, and I don't know if I'd want that energy around me all the time. We called him he "the swat team" 'cause if any hand even gets near you, he like swats them all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. He's a bodyguard for Elton John and Nicole Kidman. This is temporary. He's gonna be here. He's going to Indy 500 with us, and we'll see from there. I'm just looking out for you and your safety, Kim. That's my job, all right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. So he'll be here tomorrow. Get used to it 'cause you, my friend, have a new shadow. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here, let it float over. Look, Mase, look. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Babies love the water. It's too bad I'm not a baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know Lamar doesn't know how to swim? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? How come you don't know how to swim? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: My grandfather used to take us to this place, and they said, when they put me in the pool, it was like I never really reacted like how other babies react. Like, I would kind of like lose it, like bug out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But what about your kids? Don't they ever... aren't they like, "Dad, I want you to come in the pool?" &gt;&gt; LAMAR: They kind of make fun of me that I, like... I don't swim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My childhood memories with my dad, personally, all revolve around the swimming pool. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Swim to Mommy. Swim to Mommy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, when Lamar tells me his kids love to swim, but he doesn't know how, that bothers me. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I should learn how to swim, though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm actually an amazing swimmer, and I could teach you how to swim. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Ah...! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You would be such a fun dad in the water. You could lift them up over their heads, like, throw them... &gt;&gt; ROB: And then you let them launch off your back 'cause you're so tall and masculine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, they could sit on your shoulders. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So I could teach you how to swim? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's not going to work. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What bad could happen? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You can drown. That's what can happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not gonna let you drown. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, but we're gonna all be here. We can give you mouth-to-mouth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, all of us could give you mouth-to-mouth. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's a little crazy, 91 00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,735 but... &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: There you go. Really just play it up. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're here at our Beach Bunny photo shoot, and it's gonna be a really exciting shoot 'cause the theme is the '60s films, and it's just gonna be really cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wanted to introduce you to somebody. This is Shengo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Hey, Khloe. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nice to meet you. Oh, what a sexy accent. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I brought Shengo to the photo shoot today because I know he's gonna be spending a lot of time with the family, and I think it's really important for them to be really comfortable around him. Shengo, this is Kendall, and this is Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Hi. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, look who's here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shengo is such a little hottie. He has this tight little ass. Kris definitely did a good job at picking this one out. Maybe she secretly wants him to be with Kim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you only getting Kim a bodyguard? Because she's the prettiest one? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wouldn't leave Kim and Shengo alone together for too long now that Kim's single. &gt;&gt; KIM: She says crazy things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shengo is here so he can get to know you guys. If you had any questions for him... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if I wanted you to beat up Kourtney's baby daddy, would you do that? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: I thought you guys were gonna ask me, like, security questions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, security questions! Have you ever been stabbed? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Razor blade? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you saw me doing lines of cocaine and then I bought a prostitute, would you stop me? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Could I pay you in gum? Are you single? &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If Kim wanted you to father her child, would you do it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, I guess that went well. All right, Shengo. Now you've met the ladies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. Nice meeting you. Kim and Shengo sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am not attracted to Shengo. He is my security, and that's it. I just think it's really embarrassing when you say that in front of him because... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought it was fun interrogating him. &gt;&gt; KIM: But, like, when you tell him that I want to hook up with him and that I'm single and I only flew him out here to, like, bone him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shengo! Shengo! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is getting so defensive. Why would you get defensive if you have no feelings there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First comes love, then comes marriage-- not in Kourtney's case-- then comes the baby in the baby carriage. 149 00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:16,676 ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: So we're going to the Indy 500 today, and our day is gonna be one of the longest ever. First, we do a little test-drive in one of the actual Indy cars. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna be fine! &gt;&gt; KIM: It is so scary, but so amazing. I'm good, I'm good. A little shaken up, but... &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Oh, yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Then we have to go meet our QuickTrim driver, Graham Rahal. Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; GRAHAM: How are you? Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; MAN: He's gonna take us to the promised land. &gt;&gt; GRAHAM: Oh, we hope, we hope. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Thanks so very much for being here. How have you been? 166 00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:31,985 &gt;&gt; KIM: The Indy 500 is such a huge event. I mean, there are thousands of people here. It's, like, mayhem. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: We're not going in the crowd. We're not going in the crowd. &gt;&gt; KIM: I-I hate to say it, but my mom was right. It would've been insane without Shengo here. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Get it up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. I have goodies. I'm so excited that Lamar actually agreed to let me teach him how to swim. You kick, then you kick like that. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hold them, Rob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Up here. Not running. Look at my feet. Up and down, not in and out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Like this, in the water. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Up and down. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh, you're so stupid. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hold it... Hold it, hold it, Rob, hold it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The water pushes you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's not pushing me 'cause I always wind up right... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, but hold... &gt;&gt; ROB: Keep your legs up though. Don't put them down. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Trying to teach someone Lamar's size is really not the easiest thing to do. &gt;&gt; ROB: Come on, man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Push yourself up and go. And kick, kick, kick, kick, kick. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yo, that's not funny. Don't be an ass I don't think, if Rob's here, I'm comfortable doing this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel bad because I know Lamar's trying so hard, but Robert's sitting over here, videotaping him and mocking him the entire time. &gt;&gt; ROB: Michael Phelps, come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...two, three. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good try, baby. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's not a good... &gt;&gt; ROB: He knows, he knows it wasn't good. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's getting crazy now. &gt;&gt; ROB: A six-ten point guard, can't swim. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Get theout of here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Nah, but nothing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, what about tomorrow? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, right. I think my swimming days are over. &gt;&gt; ROB: How was swimming? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, you're ruining it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you. Oh, my God, he's hot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Double date night! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the first time that Scott has had dinner with my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to stay away from her. He's not leaving. 216 00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,776 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, he is. Mom,off. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's been the longest day so far. My mom is with Bruce, Kourtney's with Scott, everyone's busy. I'm starving, I haven't had dinner yet, and I don't want to eat by myself. So I figured, why not invite Shengo. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you. Um, I was wondering, do you want to go grab a bite to eat? 'Cause I'm a little hungry. I couldn't sleep. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Okay, give me a second. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can wait, okay. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Yeah, give me... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, I just knocked on Shengo's door to go have dinner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And he opened the door, like, in a towel. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, he's hot. 235 00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,834 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: He's hot. Okay, I'm gonna go have dinner. I'll call you back. Bye. Yeah, let's just go down to the... to the restaurant. I am starving. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: This is exciting. Something to do. 242 00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:57,957 &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. Oops. Oh, I'm so hungry. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Yeah, me, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: So what did you think of, uh, the race? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: It was awesome. Loved it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you ever seen that before? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so funny. I mean, I guess you were in work mode. I mean, it makes sense now, but everything was just like... "Let me do my job." You know, which is good. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: I guess I'm just focused, you know. I'm like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Just want it to run smoothly, you know, and do the job and get you from A to B. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just feel like, in Australia, you were so quiet. You didn't say, like, one thing. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Yeah, but-but to me, you're the boss. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, I like this. I'm the boss. I feel like it's maybe an Australian guy type of thing. Even just you pulling my chair out. Like, I haven't had a guy pull my chair out in decades-- even boyfriends. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, they should do that, you know? But it's just, I feel like Australian men are so much more polite. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I took Shengo's professionalism as being kind of standoffish. But I have a lot of respect for him. He-He's a really cool guy. We have a lot more in common than I thought. &gt;&gt; KIM: How do you have a personal life if you're always with, like, someone else? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: I'm just a workaholic. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sounds familiar. I'm a relationship kind of girl. I go from relationship to relationship. Like, so it's just gonna-- it's weird. Like, I haven't really started to date too much. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney will be like, "Oh, they just want you because, you know..." &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Do they like you for you or... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: ...do they like you for everything else? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. You know, I've dated, like, a few people here and there, but not really. You know? I need someone that doesn't do anything, that can come along 286 00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:47,867 and hang out with me the whole time. So how did you get into being a security guard? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Um, when I was pretty Matrix sex-- uh, sets. 291 00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,547 sex. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm making a sandwich. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't eat before you go swimming. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Swimming is over, dude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I was just swimming; the pool is so nice. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Swimming is kind of getting to me, 'cause I've always been able to do everything. Like, it's kind of throwing me off a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you're upset because you're not catching on fast enough? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Not saying upset, but, like, frustrated. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar Odom is a quitter? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't know. It frustrates me in a different way. I've never been frustrated like that before. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's try again. No Rob this time. Lamar is used to being the best at everything he does, and he's not used to some loser like Rob making fun of him. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't really feel like going back in the water. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you have to go. You said you were gonna learn how to swim. Don't you want to, like, conquer something that you can't do, and say, "Actually, I could do it"? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I always told my grandmother I would learn how to swim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You did? Hello? Do it for your grandmother. You're gonna swim for Mildred? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Who knows what we can do in the water. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: We can have fun, you 321 00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,887 know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. Do you think this is okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Why are you so dressy? &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause I just have this dress and I want to wear it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We got back from the Indy 500, and we're all getting ready for dinner tonight. And this is the first time that Scott has had dinner with my mom since Miami, so I'm just keeping my fingers crossed to make sure everything goes smoothly. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, buddy. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Hey, Scott, how are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's everything? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Yeah, really good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, is it just me or are we going on a double date? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom said he has to go everywhere with me. It's not a double date. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, here they come. Double date night! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Totally. Shengo, you look nice. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Very nice. All right, shall we? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ask, and you shall receive. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shengo, come sit with us. Come sit with us. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: You sure? &gt;&gt; KIM: My family's... Yeah, of course. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can just pick that up. You don't have to be so polite. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why do I feel like I'm the only one without a date. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're chaperoning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Apparently. What's sticking out of your pocket? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A Tom Ford pocket square. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who wears a Tom Ford pocket square at Katsuya? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I bet you Tom Ford does. Do you see what you guys are wearing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because we're fabulous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And I'm not? Is that what you're saying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Yeah. Do you understand English? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys look kinda cranky. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel nauseous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not pregnant, are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to stay away from her. That would be my first advice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're not asking you for your advice. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, don't be rude. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I gotta, I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta make this phone call quick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's gotta make a phone phone call? What, is he a drug dealer? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's leaving for real 'cause he doesn't want to be around you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's not leaving. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, he is. You look like the ass now because he doesn't put drama like this in his life anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? Well, what did we have todo when he put drama in our lives, Kourtney? He forced his drama on us, and we had to take it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You were rude. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am forced to put up... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Call me when you're outside. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, now she's leaving. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I'll come out. You were really rude. He's, like, "All I want is for her is to love me." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love him! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom,off! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to walk her out? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Of course. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott's trying to be a better person. Do you want to alienate her? Like, it's rude to be nice to me, Shengo, Kourtney and then treat him like a piece of It's rude. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? I'm really done now. And you've hurt my feelings. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've hurt your feelings? I'm trying to stick up for what's right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You two have fun because I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's crazy. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: I don't know enough of her story, but that was pretty... &gt;&gt; KIM: She's totally, totally, totally wrong. For her to say, "I hope you're him." &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Not him again." &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Do you want something else to drink? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, can we get two shots of Patrón? Thank you. We're gonna have a shot of tequila. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Two shots? No, I can't. &gt;&gt; KIM: One for you, one for me. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: No, I can't, I can't. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just one. It's not that bad. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: No, I can't do it. I'm on the job. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, then you're off. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: When you're home, then I'm off. &gt;&gt; KIM: So professional. All right, all right. ♫ ♫ I feel like chase it with something. Whoo! &gt;&gt; SHENGO: I'll be carrying you out piggyback. &gt;&gt; KIM: We should go. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: We should go now? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: All right. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Kim, do you need me for tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sure I do, but I can't even think straight right now. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Do you want me to call you in the morning? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, why don't you call me in the morning? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: All right. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Was your first time to Katsuya? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Mmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's good, right? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Yeah, it was nice. Did you like the dinner? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it was good. I'm so sorry about my mom tonight. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Oh, don't worry about it. It's fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, seriously, she's, like, crazy. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: It happens to all families. 430 00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:33,079 ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Good night. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I honestly can't believe what happened last night. I'm just confused. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Good. Come in. 436 00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,480 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today, I'm gonna teach Lamar how to swim again, and this time we're not gonna have any distractions, no Rob. Swimming time. All right, are we ready to try this again, baby? Okay. Oh. Oh. That's better than what you did yesterday. Are you okay? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh,! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The biggest thing about swimming, you have to, like, blow out of your mouth and nose, but then... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Out of your nose, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But hold your breath and push, soar and come. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Push, soar and come! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. That's better than you've ever done. That is better than you've ever done. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I just swam, I think, a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You just swam a lot. Pretty soon, you can swim with your kids. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I want to swim with them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can. Mmm! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Mmm! I did it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You really did. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: All right, good. Let's get out now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KIM: I honestly can't believe what happened last night. I'm just confused. And I have to go to Shengo's 464 00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,727 hotel just to make sure that we're okay. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Good. Come in. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I was gonna call you, you know, to talk about last night, but I just thought it would be better maybe if I, like, came by... &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...in person, 'cause I just, you know, don't want things to be awkward. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: No, definitely, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I just wanted to, um, I think everyone was just had, like, one too many drinks last night. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: It was a big night, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was crazy. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Is it always like that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kind of, so get used to it. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I crossed, like, a professional boundary that I shouldn't have crossed. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: No, I'm glad you came over 'cause I was thinking about it, too. And I was a bit worried, like, you know, how it was gonna play out today and... &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know what happened. I want to keep it professional and... &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, 100%, so... &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Definitely. Well, yeah, I think that, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: For sure, yeah. It's really important to me that we keep our relationship on a professional level. But the truth of the matter is, I mean, Shengo's hot, so I'm not gonna feel bad for it. Does this happen to you a lot? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Will all your clients? Seriously? &gt;&gt; SHENGO: I had to push him off... No. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, well, I'm gonna go. I won't even hug you good-bye. We can come up with, like, a secret handshake. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: Secret handshake like that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; SHENGO: All right, cool. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: What is it going to take to get you to quit smoking?
