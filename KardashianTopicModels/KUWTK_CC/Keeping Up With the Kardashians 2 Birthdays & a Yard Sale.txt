- &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're first. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Hey, guys. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Excellent. Tell me what you want to do, and we'll get to it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, obsessed with my hands. I think they look really wrinkly. Is there anything to tighten them, just so they make my hands look longer? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Well, now that you got that ring to show off. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Yeah, I can fix that, but they're gonna be so shell-shocked with the ring, they're just not gonna even pay attention to anything else. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I have a scar on my toe that I really want you to look at. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: It's easy. We'll laser it off. It works for this, it works for stretch marks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Yeah, and... &gt;&gt; KIM: What is Jonathan gonna do? &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Jonathan... &gt;&gt; KIM: Since he's here, I need to torture him. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I got freakin' stretch marks from growing so fast, 'cause I was like this, and then I went... &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: And I'm the one that's scared to do anything. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Stretch marks and love handles. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: They're not that handles. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Yes. You change into a gown... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: ...and we'll get started in no time. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: One coming in. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Laser number one. Number two. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Number two. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: One more. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Ready for takeoff. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at yours. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I don't know how I get myself into this. Shall I assist you? &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Yes, please. Jonathan... also known as the hose holder. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, thanks. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: You have to keep it cold. Pay attention. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Nurse, scalpel. &gt;&gt; KIM: The things you do for 42 00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,591 beauty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, where are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: In my room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, what is going on with you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so tired. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sleeping Beauty, are you listening? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm, yeah, I just really don't feel good. I hope I don't get North sick. I've been holding her this whole time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. Is Bruce available? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, Bruce does not live here. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh. Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you could try his cell phone. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce doesn't live here. &gt;&gt; KIM: He doesn't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, but that's so weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that's his first phone call he's ever gotten here, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ever since Bruce moved out, I mean, he hardly ever comes by the house anymore, and that's sad to me, because I still consider Bruce my dad, and I love him, and this whole separation's kind of not real to me, or I don't want to accept it, I guess. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have to get my nails done, I need a fitting. I can't even think of all the things I have to do. 68 00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:46,366 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. Life is hard. Life is tough. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you thinking about going to Magic Mountain? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. Why not? &gt;&gt; KRIS: For what? Your birthday? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They have the best churros, you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She wants to go to Magic Mountain for her birthday. &gt;&gt; KIM: That would be fun. So, what is your plan when you turn 18? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I mean, I kind of want to move out. I am excited to be turning 18. It's one of my first steps in becoming an independent woman. And one of the first things I want to do is get a place of my own. I'm excited to see what's out there. &gt;&gt; KIM: If I were to give you advice now, it's live here as long as you possibly can. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. I think you should really take your time, Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I want to go on it. &gt;&gt; KIM: How crazy does that look? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Concentrate on Magic Mountain. That should be your number one priority right now. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We. Me and... &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoever invented roller coasters is crazy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Practically an electric store. What theis this? Buford. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm looking for chargers for the computers. Where are they? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're in a bin. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you just come to this garage? It's a damn mess. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You came flying. You're a quick little sucker, aren't you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is all this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the kids' section. This is Mason and Penelope's clothes. A train set that was Rob's. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are we gonna do with all these car seats and all these different light bulbs and fixtures? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, let's look at your section. We all have hoarding tendencies. This says "gloves and goggles." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, so I got a lot of gloves. We got to figure out how to get some of this stuff out of here. Can't we sell it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My favorite thing in life would be to have a yard sale. It would be, like, my dream come true. When we were little, all we used to do was have yard sales. My mom was like the yard sale queen. She would bargain, and it was so fun. We need to get this house so spick-and-span. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, so let's do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Chop. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I'm talking about. I got you, baby. Come here, I got you. Okay, you're all right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're all right. Never let go. &gt;&gt; CICI: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Jonathan. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Do you know one of my best friends, Roman? Did you ever meet before? Kris. &gt;&gt; ROMAN: Hey, Kris. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Roman. How are you? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's CiCi. &gt;&gt; CICI: Hi, Jonathan. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's going on? &gt;&gt; CICI: How are you? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: So I left Kim a few hours ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Jonathan, I'm trying to be you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why? You're trying to do a food pick? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: By the way, we just ended up on a date. This is amazing. You're the cougar. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you setting me up? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Obviously. What do you think I brought him for? You like long hair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm really happy for Kim. There's a lot going on in her head now, you know, now that she's got that ring to carry on her finger. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, Kendall's looking for houses. It's crazy. &gt;&gt; CICI: Wait. Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall Jenner is 18 in a week. &gt;&gt; CICI &amp; KRIS: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; ROMAN: Don't you like having your own time again? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It gets a little lonely, like, sometimes when I'm at the house too long by myself. It's a bit of a void. &gt;&gt; CICI: Usually, there's ten people at a time, and she's used to so much, and it's lessening and lessening and lessening, so, maybe one day she might be alone in a big house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just can't believe that Kendall is going to turn 18. I remember like it was yesterday Kendall being born. And Kendall being two and four and ponies and preschool, so I can't even imagine how I'm gonna feel the day that Kendall moves out. And I just want to push it as far away as I can and not let it come anytime soon. Jonathan, maybe you can move in with me. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That will be fun. It's just me and Kris now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just us. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Party on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Party. Get ready. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Supposed to be a tap. You just almost broke my knuckle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Watch out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, wait a second. Since I haven't seen you girls in a few days, could we do something, like put the phones down?! And we could actually have a conversation. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Look whose phone's ringing now. Is it your girlfriend? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Who is that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, we're on speaker. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, girls. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's happening? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was calling to see what you wanted to do for your birthday. want to do for my birthday? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honestly, the last person you have to worry about is me. I don't need, like, a big part... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not a worry. It's what we want to do. You're going to be 64. That's a reason to celebrate. Can we throw you a dinner? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't... That's very nice of you... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...but I don't need a lot of people. As long as I have you guys, I'm so good, I can't stand it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My dad downplays his emotions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll plan it with everyone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't need a lot of people. I'm-I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I always worry about my dad and mom drifting apart, 'cause I always remember us as being so close. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The only people I really feel like cares is, you know, like you, Kendall and Kylie. 193 00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,288 After that, they could care less. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're having a yard sale. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How many peelers do you need? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at this! Is this a Disney house? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna pee. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is a joke. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall, I hear that you want to buy a house. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm. I already have a realtor helping me out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I personally think I'm 204 00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,645 better at helping you find a house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. Hey, bud. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: L.D. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; ROB: Aah! Tattoo, buddy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me see. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's Kourtney wearing a hood. See that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's not. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm serious. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's who he told me it was. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is it? &gt;&gt; ROB: So, now it's done. The arm's done. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys, I have some very exciting news. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Exciting news, and we need some help. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Calling all hoarders. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're the hoarders. Nobody else. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Everyone's a hoarder in this family... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not a hoard... Well, Kris Jenner's a hoarder. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...in case you weren't aware. &gt;&gt; ROB: Exactly. That's what... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me. I'm not a hoarder. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh... We're having a yard sale. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really don't have anything to get rid of. &gt;&gt; ROB: I honestly don't have anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't have anything to get rid of? &gt;&gt; ROB: I hate holding onto things and, like, keeping them around. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All I got to say is, you better be inviting Mom to this thing, 'cause Mom needs to, like, really release. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Everyone can get rid of something. &gt;&gt; ROB: You should do, like, an all-nude garage sale. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to do my penis enlarger. I'll get good money for that. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at this. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What is this crap? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. Look. A bantam Beanie Baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, this is going in our pile. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I like this lion, though. I want to take this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. And this. This says "plenty." Plenty of what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Is this all yard sale? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you guys doing? Those are my Ralph Lauren antler... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're having a yard sale due to all the hoarding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not giving up my candelabras. Stop it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: These two go first. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. Stop it. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: These two go first. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The whole family has, like, a slight hoarding gene, but my mom is definitely one of the worst. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look what's in this drawer. Look at all this crap that's in this drawer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom thinks that she should be keeping this little toothpick from when she had dinner with her best friend Sally. It's just reallyup. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look. Look at this rusty knife. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! I need that knife! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I couldn't sell this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When I slice carrots, it makes them waffled. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Stop. This is, like, terrible. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why do you need two of these? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know why I have multiple amounts of items. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How many peelers do you need? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna pee. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What are...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is a joke. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It could go back to my childhood when I thought we couldn't afford it, and now I just want to make sure that we are prepared for anything and everything. How come you guys get to decide what's trash? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Guys, I have the piece de resistance. Follow me. We're gonna sell this. What kind of crap you got here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. This is mean! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you looking for food again? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you calling me fat? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I would never do that. So, what's been going on? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. School's good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you want to be when you grow up? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. You always steal that shirt back from me as if it's yours. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We were just discussing, what do you want to be when you grow up. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I want to be a monster. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, Kendall, I hear that, I mean, you're really getting serious about this, uh, house thing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yup. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You want to buy a house? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a big responsibility. And you're very fortunate. You know that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Most kids, when they're 18, can't buy a house. Do you have any idea where or what type of house you want, or you just want to start looking? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I already have a realtor helping me out, so... I know my mom really doesn't want me to move out, but, now that my 18th birthday is around the corner, I want to get serious and start the house-hunting process. I want to start looking, you know, feel everything out. The only thing that I know that I want is, like, space. I just know that I want a yard... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ...so that I can get a dog. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm the same way. I love the space. There's a lot of them that size around here. Brody got a five-acre lot. Five acres. That's a ton of property out in Malibu. Kendall wants to get away from everything at the house. Like father, like daughter. Go, Kendall. You know, it's a big step, but I think she's ready to do it. This is my opinion. I personally think I'm better at helping you find a house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am putting together a birthday for Bruce. Especially right now. He feels left out, and I just don't want him to feel that way. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like Khloe has to be, like, his favorite daughter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce? Can I talk to you for a sec? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, what did I do wrong? Why am I in the...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're saying it's a great idea that she moves out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well... I don't want to ruin it for her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're not gonna ruin anything. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're the one that wants to bring this stuff up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have a huge fat roll on my stomach. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have so many fat rolls on my body that it's not funny. &gt;&gt; KIM: But when do they go away? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mine still haven't gone away. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's Khloe. Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just driving with Kourt. We're heading over to Mom's. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, good. Um, I'll kill two birds with one stone, then. I am putting together a birthday dinner for Bruce, and I was thinking if we could all do it on Sunday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we can do that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, just keep it low-key with fam, and just have it cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, especially right now with everything, I feel like he feels left out, and I just don't want him to feel that way. He says that only me, Kendall and Kylie care about his birthday. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's, like, ridiculous-- we all care. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He doesn't want you guys to feel like you're obligated. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't feel obligated. Like, we want to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I know-- I just want him to feel it, guys, feel the love. &gt;&gt; KIM: Feel it, okay. With the new baby and everything that I have going on, and since Bruce isn't around the house on a daily basis, I just didn't even think to plan something for Bruce on his birthday. But of course, Khloe-- Little Miss Perfect-- she thinks of everything first, just to make us all look bad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We will be there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, bye. I feel like Khloe is making us look bad. She, like, has to be, like, his favorite, you know? I feel like I need to outdo Khloe. I want him to feel like we all care. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but what could you do? He doesn't care about presents. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We should have got him a singing telegram. Kim, what is the password on this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that my computer? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your more natural look is much better for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you, Kanye. That's what he tells me every day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He just paid me to say that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you see this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Where did that come out? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is it warm in here, or...? &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, I think it would be really cool if we found... someone, you know, like, some of Bruce's old teammates-- so type in, like, "Olympics..." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: From the U.S. team or other countries? &gt;&gt; KIM: "Olympic U.S. team..." Let me look. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm trying to understand what exactly you guys are trying to accomplish... &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want him to feel like we really... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Feel special, because Khloe said he only thinks Kendall, Kylie and Khloe care about him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Bruce, we all know, loves to talk about the Olympic games and his life during that time, so what better surprise for Bruce on his birthday than to find some guys that actually lived these moments with him? Okay, so, in the Montreal games, where Bruce won, there was 396 competitors. So, we don't care about archery or men's boxing... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Speak for yourself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He needs somebody who was in the tria... What does he do, triathlon? Like, jumping offand jumping over? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He was a solo guy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He was a solo singer. &gt;&gt; KIM: So here, "Final standings. Fred Samara, Fred Dixon," and that's it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should we call Fred and Fred? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I, like, doubt he's listed-- he was a Olympic athlete. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, wait, look, his number is listed right here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, perfect. Hit him up. &gt;&gt; SAMARA: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Is this Fred? &gt;&gt; SAMARA: Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. It's Kim Kardashian. How are you? &gt;&gt; SAMARA: Oh, wow. Hi. I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: You competed with my stepdad Bruce in the Olympics in 1976. &gt;&gt; SAMARA: Yeah. Two Freds and Bruce. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, a Fred sandwich. I know this is the craziest request ever, but we want to find some of his old teammates to join us for a birthday dinner. &gt;&gt; SAMARA: Well, that would be amazing-- I'd love to do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you have the other Fred's number, so I can invite him as well? &gt;&gt; SAMARA: No, I don't actually have it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I could cyber-stalk him 406 00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,699 and find it. &gt;&gt; FRED: Uh... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You go very, very, very slow. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See, you just can't be in a rush when you're driving. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm not ever in a rush, I'm just a little bit smarter. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it's smarter. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: House hunting. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you excited? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what would be cool is if you could actually, uh, get a house out in Malibu. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I thought about that. My older brothers, Brandon and Brody, love living in Malibu. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Any time you want to stay away from all the drama-- come hang out with your older brothers-- cruise out. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And I'm really excited to look at the same area. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When you make that drive out to Malibu, you get out there and it's... You're a million miles away from the city. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Boy, how do you think Mom will do? If I'm out of the house, couple of months, you're out of the house... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie wants to stay with me a lot. She'll be all alone. &gt;&gt; TOMER: Got three bedrooms, so the secondary bedrooms are towards the front of the house. This is kind of combination formal living room, formal dining room. It's a more open floor plan. It's really open 'cause it's single story. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. Wow, this kitchen is so cute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is the best room here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; TOMER: Yeah, they've got, like, I think, 12- or 13-foot ceilings. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, you could just give up on all this and move in with me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at all the money you'd save. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, maybe. House hunting has been a little different than I anticipated. I still haven't really found a place that I'm in love with. I definitely have to keep looking, 'cause hopefully I'll find something soon. &gt;&gt; TOMER: It's a cute house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This house, yeah. &gt;&gt; TOMER: For your daughter, yeah. 447 00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,969 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nice house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How much can I pay you to get that bar out of your ear? It just looks like it hurts. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So '90s. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce, with your ponytail, I don't think you can comment on Kylie's ear bar. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hold it, hey, what is in your mouth? Open up your mouth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, you want a ponytail, she wants a grill, I want burgundy lips, she wants bunny ears, we're all good to go, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, we don't have a long time to plan, you guys. We only have a few days until the garage sale. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you, like, getting rid of all my stuff, or what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm just going through all the crap that everyone says I've been hoarding for the last 20 years. We're gonna do this for charity. Speaking of charity, you guys, what charity do you want to give it to? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What about, um, a charity for hungry children in America? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I vote Fisher House for veterans coming home who are greatly injured, for them and their family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you know about this? Whatever we make, we could match it and give to the other charity. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's even a better idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just came up with the best idea, and I love that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, guys, I'm gonna go. I'm sad that I have to miss Kendall and Bruce's birthday, but Scott and I are going to New York to get everything situated with his dad. You know, it's much more important for me to be in New York with Scott, so they'll have a birthday next year. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good-bye, P, bye. Yeah, good wave, that was very good. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Whoo, Six Flags! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're gonna die at this ride, Brandon, it's crazy. I'm excited that today we are renting out all of Magic Mountain to celebrate my birthday, just 'cause you get on a ride and you're so scared and then you do it and you have so much fun and it's almost like turning 18, and you're kind of scared to be independent and whatever, and then you do it and you're having so much fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everybody ready, let's rock and roll! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, no, thanks. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What the? I'm not down for this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You ready? 490 00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,301 &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Full throttle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am so not going on that ride. Maybe we can just go climb that tree and call it a day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That was so fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce. Can I talk to you for a sec? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, what did I do wrong, why am I in the... ? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is really the first opportunity that I've had to talk to Bruce about Kendall moving out, and I just want to know what they're up to and why he's in such a rush to get her out of the house and to move to Malibu. Don't you think it's weird if we're on this... opposite pages when it comes to Kendall? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Opposite pages? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. You're saying it's a great idea that she moves out when she's 18 and I think she should stay home for a little while. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want to ruin it for her. We'll wait till we get on the ride, then we'll talk about it. Why do I refuse to comply with Kris' kind of thinking, okay? Hey, it's very simple. All of a sudden, now, Kendall's got to do all these things herself. You know, cook her own food, do her own laundry, get her own ironing done. And I think, you know, it's time for her to, you know, kind of take that next step in life. We don't want to discuss this around her. Wait till we get on the ride. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All the money goes to feed children. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Brucie. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, Kourt's even here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who's this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come here, little lady! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is happening? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I'm upset because you keep allowing her to move out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honestly, I think it would be good for her to move out, I mean, look what... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, 526 00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:31,243 what's going on? Oh, &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe! Let's go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, Bruce, I don't do roller coasters. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So... I'm upset because you keep taking Kendall's side and allowing her, like, to move out. And she's 18 years old. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, well, of course. She's a very mature girl. I can't believe Kris is upset that I'm encouraging Kendall to move out of the house when she's only 18 years old. I was 18 years old. I moved out of the house. I-I never came back. You know, kids do this. She's a lot more mature than Kim was when she moved out at 18 and you didn't have problems with that, and honestly, I think it would be good for her to move out, I mean, look what... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, what's going on? Oh,,, &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, look what's going on at our house. Kanye there and all these people there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It would be perfect for her to have her own place, get her out on her own, get the responsibility that goes along with it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can we do it again? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you hear anything 551 00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,455 I was saying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, basketball. Whoo! Go, Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, this is fun. Oh... I don't want you to grow up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a little suspicious that Bruce wants her to move to Malibu so she can be him. Bruce. And I'm not gonna take it anymore. How about we have a little challenge? If I win... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cash. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. If I win, you got to back off with Kendall. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. No, I'm not gonna back off on that. Something else. One night at the house. One last shot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ew! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, honey, I'm going to kick your little butt here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's, like, crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're, like, impossible to get. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is like having sex for a really long time and never having an orgasm. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I wouldn't know on that department. The whole key to this is, do as many as you can. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hate this game. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, I just got it on! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you actually get it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I win the bet! You got to back off. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, I think you get one of those teddy bears. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm gonna wake up tomorrow, I'm not gonna be able to move at all. Like, right now I'm just like... That's what I feel like I'm doing right now, I think I'm just like, "Hey, guys. Hey, what's going on?" &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do it with me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. I-I've never... This one is crazy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey, come on, don't be scared. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, hell, no. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: This is just nuts. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's kind of cool spending today with my whole family. I love you, Mom and Dad! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's the old spirit. Bye! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause even though I want to be an independent woman, I still like to have fun. 593 00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,888 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yay...! Yay...! I'm proud of both of you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Blue. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How's the new dog working out? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good. Blue, come here. I got her a blue collar. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then why is she wearing the red collar? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause it had to be delivered. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You special-ordered the dog a collar? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Anyway, are you ready to go look at some more houses? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You could, uh... still move out to Malibu. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I haven't made any decisions. I'm just trying to find one that I'm, like, in love with. I'm in no rush. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kenny. What are you guys talking about? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Houses. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I thought we weren't gonna talk about houses anymore, remember? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I won the bet at Magic Mountain, and he's still going behind my back trying to pressure Kendall to move out. I'm not happy and this isn't cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's quite capable-- I've been telling you that from the beginning-- she's quite capable of figuring this out herself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Then why do you keep telling her what to do if... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not telling her what to do, I'm just helping her to do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you want her to stay here... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It sounds like you guys are fighting over me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are the one who judges everyone about their hoarding, but you've donated the least amount of stuff. We could definitely get rid of that pink thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But Mom got it for her for her first Christmas. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, are you turning into Mom?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Happy birthday. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you for coming. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Where is everybody? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is anybody else showing up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I thought we weren't gonna talk about houses anymore, remember? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is what I think. Okay, I'm out, Kendall goes, Kylie is not far behind-- you're stuck in this big house all by yourself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I want her to live upstairs in her bedroom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's quite capable of figuring this out herself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Then why do you keep telling her what to do if... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not telling her what to do, I'm just helping her to do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You guys? I am legally an adult, and I can do what I want. Don't want you to use me moving out as a reason to get upset with each other. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am never going to be ready to let Kendall go. Kendall, I can't tell you that I'm jumping up and down for joy, but we're gonna support you, no matter what. I think the one thing that I have to realize is that Kendall is now an adult, and she needs to not always have us fight over her. So now it's time to give her a little credit, and trust her decisions, and let her be a grown-up. I get you. And I get you. Fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. Let's go look for a house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, whatever you want, Kendall, I'm right there with you. They're dropping like flies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hi, Khloe. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at this! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Nice work, Khloe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A little helicopter! little. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. Very good. Thank you so much, babe. That's really sweet of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Brucie. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know-- you're always been my favorite. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. Why, thanks. There's other people here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi! Love you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you for coming. &gt;&gt; LEAH: How cute are these! This is a whole outfit, Khlo. : I'm really liking this! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If we're gonna do this, let's do it right. Voila! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, that's a good look. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Can I have one of these? Can I just stab one...? yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What time was this supposed to start? Is anybody... is anybody else showing up? My little Khloe, of course, would come through for a birthday party. It certainly is appreciated, but where the other people are, I don't know. They all have busy schedules. That's one of the reasons why I didn't want to have a party. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brody's not coming. They got more important things to do. This place is filling up, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, I'm helping! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, where's my pink bike? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, relax. We sold it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hate everyone besides everyone that's in here. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Thank you, Khloe. For clearing that up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brody's not coming. They got more important things to do. It may just be us. We should order. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just walking in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, cool. Oh, got it, hang up on me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stealing some of your butter. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hap-py birthday! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa...! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is so funny. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: I, um, wanted to bring the baby, but I left her by herself with Kanye, and I'm, like, so freaked out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's nobody else in the house. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's no one at home. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's the only one with the baby? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This'll be good for him. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, that's cool, that's good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hopefully, she won't pee for a while. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it's time to get him going! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, you're the cutest party giver, by the way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am impressed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you like the golf ball and the helicopter cake we got you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This cake is everything. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce, we have a few surprises for you tonight. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: We have a few surprises for you tonight. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: More? Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She was telling us about that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Surprises? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Jeff Dunham is naked. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce. &gt;&gt; KIM: I found two of Bruce's teammates, Fred Dixon and Fred Samara, and I'm a little nervous. I really hope that Bruce likes these guys. I would be so devastated if Bruce didn't even know who they were. been, like, 35 years since he's seen them all. &gt;&gt; DIXON: Hello, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fred Dixon and Fred Samara. Where the hell did you come in from?! A little of my past! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, party! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My teammates! How cool is that? &gt;&gt; SAMARA: This is very cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is the 1976 Olympic team. This is the first time that all three guys who were on the Olympic decathlon team in 1976 have gotten together in, what-- it's been 37 years! That's amazing! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, you were so surprised. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah! Fred Dixon and Fred Samara walk in the door! &gt;&gt; SAMARA: Big surprise is we're gonna go out in the parking lot... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And we're gonna run a hundred? No, thank you. No, thank you, Fred. He's still... he's still in shape. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want to say, happy birthday... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...to one of the greatest guys in the entire universe. And I have listened to you for the last 23 years, how I've heard stories about your buddies, 575,000 times... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: These are the actual guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And to have you guys here on this night means everything, because, ah... &gt;&gt; DIXON: Thank you for inviting us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: As things have changed with Kris' and my relationship and me living out in Malibu, this birthday party really proves that, uh, you know, my family still loves me, and, uh, they're very thoughtful, and they got me a present that I could never buy, no matter what I had, you know, and that's the friendships I've had throughout my life, and, uh, it honestly really means a lot to me. They put a lot of thought into this. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, he is loving these friends. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know. His face? &gt;&gt; KIM: He is so excited. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you all for being here, especially the Freds. This is so cool! I can't believe you're, like, sitting here. still 766 00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,186 here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Queen Elizabeth II... What?! What is going on here?! "Bruce Jenner Day"?! Who knew he was so special? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I still haven't lost it. This is the official score sheet from the Games... ha! I'm number one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe made that, so let's put it in the garage sale. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God... These are my wedding shoes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: With Robert? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, with you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, cool. I was on that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce and I have shared so many amazing years together. This is purple... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's wild. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have been the best parents that we know how to be, and I think that we look forward to other chapters in our lives together and making even more memories. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your father's baby hair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh...! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's taped right there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My God, it is! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That is so cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here they come. Hi, paparazzi! They just are such idiots. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is this? Dude... seriously? Oh, why do you need this extra-long ruler? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't even know whose that is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, I did need it. See? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am determined to get this out of here. 796 00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:59,150 Kourt... hmm... What's below me? Oh, yeah! We're getting rid of the basket, man! And the ruler! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice job. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The ruler needs to stay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, give me back the ruler! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was a great... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No...! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If it weren't for the ruler, you wouldn't be getting... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you gonna do with this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Measure myself. And it helped save the day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you need that pink car? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who rides that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Penelope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The fact that you have cars inside of cars... I feel like we could definitely get rid of that pink thing. It all goes to charity... so someone would get this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But P likes it. She only has, like, one car that's hers, so you're going to take her only other car away? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, don't do that. This whole yard sale is Kourtney's idea, so I really don't get why Kourtney has the least amount of things to contribute to the yard sale. You are the one who judges everyone about their hoarding skills... but you've donated the least amount of stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But Mom got it for her, for her first Christmas. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? This thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, are you turning into Mom? And you're going to keep everything that you guys believe 825 00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,225 is sentimental but it's really not? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, welcome to the garage sale. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, look, Bruce could sign these paddles. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Out with the old, in with the new. &gt;&gt; KIM: My skis? Who said I would sell my skis? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did. I'll take $100 for those. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Brucey! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, Kourt's even here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to help us? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Brucey! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You brought a rock? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is there anything I'm gonna want to buy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, no! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: People are coming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is going to be a really fun day because I'm here with the whole family. My girlfriend Carnie Wilson is here, and she's brought all of her baked goods and she's an amazing cook. &gt;&gt; CARNIE: Raspberry bars. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Raspberry, and this is peanut butter...? &gt;&gt; CARNIE: Peanut butter, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All of the money goes to feed children. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All of the proceeds are going to charity, which actually motivates me to release some of the clutter that we have accumulated over the years and, at the same time, bring attention to some causes that are really important to our family. &gt;&gt; MAN: How much is this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 30 bucks. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, it's a deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thirty... &gt;&gt; KIM: You should've at least said 100 for that bag. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...forty... then you should've said it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Here you go. this book got me through my first divorce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're doing good? Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Next. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Next up. What do you think, Khloe? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! These-- five and five. And, Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, how much, you idiot? I'm not asking you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This place is filling up, guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This has been in the family forever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good-- 30 bucks to charity. That's a deal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, I'm helping. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Uh, $25 for these two. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Cool. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Thank you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Next. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney. She will not let us sell this. Let's do the "sell it" chant. Sell it, sell it. Kourtney is delusional. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, I used to love these dolls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're getting rid of , and you have a lot of to get rid of. Like, you are a little mini hoarder, and it's gross. &gt;&gt; GIRL: How much is this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ten bucks and it's yours and it's out the door. How's that? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ten bucks for what? What is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, relax. Thank you, all for charity. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, that's enough. Khloe, where's my pink bike? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We sold it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you did not. Stop lying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, that's why it's here. I sold it for 20 bucks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not nice. That was Penelope's that you got 886 00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:43,942 her for her first Christmas. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you going to cry? &gt;&gt; CARNIE: Yeah, good choice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks, you guys. All for a good cause. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where's my pink bike? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I sold it for 20 bucks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did she sell? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My pink bike. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not yours. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was Penelope's that you got her for her first Christmas. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you going to cry? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, she wouldn't let me bring it here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not gonna cry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's 40 of them at the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did we sell it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw, I'm sorry. Kourtney happens to be exactly like me when it comes to parting with things. Everything has a memory. We're both emotional hoarders. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're making a fool out of yourself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is a garage sale that you planned. I think you have to reevaluate the things that you bring to the garage sale and now you're putting back in your bag. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: As much as I criticize my mom being a hoarder, I realize that I am exactly the same way and it's just hard to get rid of things. Everything has a story behind it. It's, like, emotional to me. &gt;&gt; GIRL: How much is this jacket? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, that's cute. I would say $15? &gt;&gt; GIRL: Okay, thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're welcome. But I'm happy to see that somebody else can enjoy all these things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, I need you to help me add all this stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is he doing, though? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott decided to prank my mom because she always falls for all of our pranks. That guy just pinched my butt and ran away. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! Can we get some security right here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: With everything going on with his mom and he's been stressed out, I love seeing Scott having fun with everyone and really, you know, opening up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's not funny. Seriously not funny. He just grabbed Carnie's food from her table. Where's security? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come here, little lady! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is happening? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I almost had a heart attack. Scott, I'm going to kill you! Oh, my God, I need a drink. Oh, my God.
