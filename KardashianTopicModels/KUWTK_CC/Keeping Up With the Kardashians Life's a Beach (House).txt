- Previously on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians: God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KIM: They're telling me now that my house won't be ready. I have to get a new place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you should just give me a month at my house. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we'll give it a shot for a month while we look for something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's my girl. Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How upset do you think your mom would be if Brody and I got my dad a putting green at the house? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: He's got that little corner of the garage. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He should have something that's a little bit more fun over at the house, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, we're doing it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Kris will probably lose her mind, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That would drive 19 00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,404 her nuts. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I want to go to a football game. Mwah... I love tailgating. I'm, like, consumed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hug like this, and I'm like a tree holding onto the vine. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: College town, tailgating was fun in college, too, for football. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love my Lammie so much, I thought my honeymoon phase has never ended. Mine and Lammie's anniversary is coming up, so I really want to do something special for him. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Even though they weren't that good... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For he's the tree, and I'm the vine. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: ...tailgating was fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...growing up you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: He's a tree, you're the stem, and your children will be the leaves. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: And this way is going in. It's going in, it's going... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, that is so sick. I know I should not be surprised anymore, but love is seriously such a crazy thing. I mean, the fact that Lamar could fart right in front of me, and I still love him more and more every day, and that's why this is the guy that I married in nine days. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't know if I should deuce it first or... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! You just got to end that romantic stuff... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm prairie, 44 00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:46,274 I'm prairie-dogging a little bit over here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? need to wear the sunglasses in the house? Are you going with a rock star? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you really need to wear your pants up to here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, that's where my waist is. I got long legs, baby. Back in the old days it worked very well. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And what is that shirt you have on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know! It's a shirt. I'm gonna go hit golf balls in a little while. Uh! Jeffy! &gt;&gt; JEFF: Hey, how are ya? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God, it's always scary to see you. Every time I see you, it costs a lot of money. &gt;&gt; JEFF: How have you been? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! &gt;&gt; JEFF: How are you? Is there a design emergency I'm here for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: There is a big design emergency. I want to take the blue room and make it a nursery. A baby nursery. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Are you...? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've got to be kidding. A nursery? Are you...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not pregnant. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you pregnant? Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. There is so much to do before Kim and Kanye move in so that they feel comfortable. I'm just exhausted thinking about it. We're gonna redo the whole thing. I think what you should do... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We just did this room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...is take this whole wall back here and make it a whole shelf situation. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You need closet space, honey. You can't take all the closet's room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You relax. We got this. You know? &gt;&gt; JEFF: What colors do you want to do in here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, that's the $60 million question. &gt;&gt; JEFF: I mean, we have to stick with the blue bathroom. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, will you turn the microwave on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we're good. This is like an executive chef style. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There's been a lot of people here today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's been, like, a lot of people moving in. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Don't you think it's gonna be, like, too many people here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna have to be a little bit patient with everybody for the next couple of months. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There's gonna be, like, a baby here. And like, you know Kylie and her friends, and you know me and my friends. Like, I'm still a teenager and so is Kylie. So I just feel like maybe that's a little much for all those people to be living here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's a little much for any family to go through, but like any family, I mean, we stick together. We're here for each other. She needs us right now. Hey! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I didn't know you were here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where'd you come from? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, we were here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I went up there, and you were out cold. You want to move in? Everyone else is. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Don't forget about Esus. That's gonna be a little different here. Oh, there she is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You woke up? &gt;&gt; KIM: I woke up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you know you snored? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: Was I snoring in my sleep? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You could hear you in San Francisco. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you always snored? &gt;&gt; KIM: Only in my largeness, do I snore. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You really picked a good time to have Kim move in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, I didn't plan this pregnancy. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Well, you usually plan everything. And so you couldn't have worked this out? I mean, really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We just have to see how it all pans out. And I don't think that the kids should be allowed to bring any friends over for the first, at least 40 days. I know it's not exactly how you guys want to spend your summer. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I appreciate you just being as patient as possible. It's gonna be a very calm environment, very peaceful. I'm gonna have candles burning, Zen music, : people whispering. And everyone's gonna wear white. Just like a spa. 126 00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:07,242 Or an insane asylum. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, a nut house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What a fun store. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's get a whoopee cushion and do it to Mom. Wait-- is that a bunny with horns? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a jackalope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do you know that word? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause it says it right there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. Gold star for Kourtney. Surprise! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my goodness. You're a unicorn. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you take a picture of me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wonder why I am smiling? Hot in there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was a good one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, Kourt, look at this pinup girl erotica. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't understand what this is for. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just need some sexy inspiration. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But for what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For my shoot that I want to do, for real. Lamar and mine's anniversary is coming up, and, like, you don't always have to buy a present. It's good when you make things and put thought into things. And so I am going to do a fun, flirty photo shoot for Lamar. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but what kind of shoot are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, pin-up-y. Just old school and cool. I am more of a Marilyn Monroe type of whore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look, it's me, you and Kim. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! It really is! We're sperm! You're the little one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can go with the wire wheels. White, and it was painted red with the hubcaps and the whitewalls. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, Brandoni's here. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What's Bruiser doing? He's on the phone? He doesn't greet people? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Sounds like he's ordering a car. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Let's see if you and I can do the simultaneous butt twitch. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Wait-- how does it go? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Do you remember when Dad used to do it? It's like, it was... Is that it? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Let's count it off. The women love it. One, two, three, twitch. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My wife comes back, I'm gonna talk to her. Hopefully, by Friday or Saturday we'll say, "Ready? Go." Thanks, Dave. Bye. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: There was one thing that I heard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: You said, "So, I'm gonna talk to my wife when she gets back, and then I'll give you a call back, and I'll let you know if it's a go or not." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, that's exactly how it works. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: My only fear is that you won't end up getting it. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let's make sure that it's not around the same time as when we put the putting green in 'cause that could cause some conflicts. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: While we were in Greece, Brody and I decided that a putting green would be a really good addition to the house for Dad. You got a place in Malibu. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I lasted, uh, not even the first week. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Whoa. Hold on. So you're back? Why did you do it in the first place? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 'Cause she wanted me to! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: We should get him a putting green. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Honestly, Kris would kill us. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: He's such an easygoing guy. He's lost a lot of space in his own house. So it was a bit of an imbalance. And I do feel like he could gain a little bit more control. &gt;&gt; BRODY: We're doing the putting green. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wait, wait, wait, wait-- did Kris sign? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, no, but we figured that it might not happen if she knows. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't be involved 195 00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:06,354 in this. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: That's fine. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You guys have lived out here for a really long time, haven't you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, on and off, yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: You were tiny when I first met you. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It doesn't even feel like I've known you for that long. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I know! It's true. So... I think we're going to be moving back to Malibu. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Really? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's so amazing. I've been wanting to maybe get, like, a house for the summer, to see how I like it. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Wow! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I want to try it out. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Kendall! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I mean, I don't know what my mom's gonna say. I've been planning on moving out when I turn 18, but since the house is getting a little bit crazier, so many more people and a new baby in the house, I'm thinking about trying to find a place a little bit earlier. And, like, now I know that you guys are gonna be there, it's more comfortable. &gt;&gt; LEAH: We'll be there. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Brody's out there. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Brody's out there. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm gonna look for a place, find one, and then tell my mom. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's a risky plan. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: It is a risky plan. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Isn't he cute? Oh, my goodness, you're... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Nick. &gt;&gt; NICK: How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, handsome. I am meeting up with Nick, who is a fabulous photographer, and we are are gonna go over some concepts for our photo shoot and hopefully finalize it today. &gt;&gt; NICK: Um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's really sexy. Right? &gt;&gt; NICK: So that's awesome, right? And you... you... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I think it is. &gt;&gt; NICK: You've got the height. God knows you can rock the heels, so I feel like you can really pull that off. My gut tells me we go straight for the art. We do black and white. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You and I are totally on the same page. &gt;&gt; NICK: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: With, like, not being too much. It has to be my style, or this is gonna look ridiculous. I want it to be special for Lamar, but I still want it to be tasteful. Because all I am thinking about is Lamar's laugh when he saw the candy love tape... Mmm... He cannot have that reaction when I show him these photos. &gt;&gt; NICK: So we're only gonna shoot something where you look amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; NICK: You know. And the goal is to make Lamar happy. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, Bernard? And you can just watch your mom be a whore. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I got this tea in Ojai. I've never made this before, so I don't know what it's gonna taste like. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mmm. &gt;&gt; LEAH: We'll see. &gt;&gt; BRODY: What's going on? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Try this. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Thank you. Cheers. Yeah, it's good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God, that's good! &gt;&gt; LEAH:Yay! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: So we have something to talk to you about. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, I want to show you some stuff. Come over here so I can show you some pictures. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: We went to your house, and we took a bunch of pictures of your lawn. Look at all this stuff. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Remember, I'm not supposed to be involved in this. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I know, you're not. No, this is just... &gt;&gt; BRODY: We'll keep it on the DL. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got a Sharpie? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: This is all hypothetically... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is hypothetical. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: If you were to do something... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If I knew anything about this. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: ...this is... Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. This is how I would do it. I would go... a putting green right down this edge, and then right down into this little corner down here. It comes around like this... in this corner, sand trap. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Whoa. Kris is gonna lose her mind. This is big. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would put two chipping areas. One chipping area, like, way over here. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, so you're... oh. Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, we got a water hazard: the pool. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That's a big area. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, yeah, it's big. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Literally, Kris will not have any grass at all. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He wants to have a-a putting green and a chipping flat in the backyard. He should be able to have that decision without having to ask Kris, and he makes a lot of good money on his own. It should be a balanced relationship. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. See you, guys. I think it's gonna look great. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm a little nervous to do it, but I think that it's something that has to be done. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: This thing is a lot bigger than I was thinking. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You look like a big piece of licorice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I look like Missy Elliot in that video. I literally looked like the Batman. It's like a queef. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's all this stuff in the garage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim's moving in. We're doing a whole nursery. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She doesn't need to be back here. Looks like I'm not even gonna have the little space I-I have now. 296 00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:09,830 And I'm just getting tired of it. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Bernard! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bernard! Come in the water. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You wouldn't want to get in this water. It's freezing outside. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not cold in the water. I want him to try to swim. It's not that bad. &gt;&gt; MALIKA:He's like, "I'm not stupid." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Bernard is delivering your Stockroom outfits that you ordered. Watch out, baby. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Come here... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bernard. You're gonna rip the latex. Malika and I went shopping for the perfect outfit for my photo shoot. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I can't move. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm sorry I'm laughing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm stuck. Look at it. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You look like a big piece of licorice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I look like Missy Elliot in that video. It's like... my crotch, there's three, like, inches that's not supposed to be there. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Well, I was gonna try to pull you up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It smells so bad. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's kind of like you're in a big condom right now. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yeah, baby. Oh... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You're not supposed to get off in moments like these. It's a little perverted. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, lube me up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob... go away. I get I'm not Halle Berry, but that was where I was going. I literally look like the Batman. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's actually kind of... you know, it's kind of cute. That is so disgusting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think I want to make those noise? It's like a queef. &gt;&gt; KIM: Jeff? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; JEFF: This is one of the rugs. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; JEFF: And this is the biggest that they go, so depending on how we... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm more like... Did you see the recent references Kanye sent over? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Huh-uh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I e-mailed it to you. We can look at it from a big computer. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Okay. I pulled stuff from my own library. This is basically picking your brain to see what you like. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I do everything opposite of my mom. &gt;&gt; JEFF: And these linens are really beautiful, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What... Oh, boy, oh, boy... Kim doesn't have a place to stay-- gotta bring the baby home-- and things are moving into the house and taking over my house. I'm gonna have a tough time with this. Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's all this stuff in the garage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: "Right." That's all you're gonna say? I mean... it's just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you shouldn't worry about all the stuff that's going on in the house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, and there's all this baby stuff. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a little crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We've already had all our babies, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim's moving in. We're doing a whole nursery. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Certainly Kim has the means to do what she needs to do. She doesn't need to be back here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, she does need to be back here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's like this house isn't even our own. I mean, it's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim sold her house. They bought a new one... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know the story. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and it's not ready until February. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know... I gotta put up with this? Hey, lookit, I'm an easygoing kind of guy. But it looks like I'm not even gonna have the little space I-I have now. And I'm just getting tired of it. I'm just getting tired of it. There's nothing for me here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Want to play with us? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, come on. I... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Bernard. Sorry. Here, Bernard. Bernard, come here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. Why did Rob just send me this? What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here. Come here. Send you what? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is like... what is going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But why did he send you that? &gt;&gt; KIM: What is this for? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to talk about it! &gt;&gt; KIM: But you have to tell me, or I'm gonna Instagram this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's... stop. No, give me your phone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tell me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's an outfit. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's not Halloween anytime soon. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a photo shoot I'm doing for Lam. And I don't want to talk about it, 'cause I'm still figuring it out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Figuring what out? What kind of shoot you're gonna do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I'm going to be doing, like... do you know Pink? Like, how she does those acrobatic things? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what I'm doing. &gt;&gt; KIM: An acrobatic latex shoot? Bible, you're not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're fun to talk to. &gt;&gt; KIM: You and your, like, candy bathtub videos... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not that video. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and your photo shoot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At the beginning of creating the shoot, I was so excited, and I just had this perfect vision and everything was gonna be sexy. But now everyone is making fun of me, and I cannot relive the candy tape. Kim, don't make me more insecure. I've already paid for everything. I've already set everything up. I don't need your judgy-wudgy eyes. Bernard, do not eat my pillow secretly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hey, guys. &gt;&gt; LEAH: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: We really want to do this putting green and without all the rest of the kids' support, I don't really see how it's possible. So I reached out to all of the kids. I thought it would be a good idea if we just went to dinner to put this thing in concrete. &gt;&gt; KIM: But if you only saw my feet right now. I'm gonna hold one up. You'll die. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Should we wait until after dessert? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, Brandon! &gt;&gt; KIM: My feet are just really swollen. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Damn, girl. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just indent it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, Brandon, talk to us about the putting green. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, we started taking it more seriously and we talked to Dad, you know, about it and he kind of... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, he knows about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought it was a surprise. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's a surprise-- for Kris. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Th-They were thinking, like, a little putting green. And Bruce now wants it to be, like, a massive one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So when are we doing this? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, you know... &gt;&gt; BRODY: When is Kris going out of town? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: ...part of our theory is, is... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, well, I leave to go to New York and then I'm going to Paris after, and she was gonna come with me to New York. And I can just have her come to Paris with me. So that could work. &gt;&gt; BRODY: How do you think Kris is going to react to this realistically? &gt;&gt; KIM: Realistically, she'll probably flip. &gt;&gt; LEAH: They just don't want to get in trouble and they won't get in trouble if everybody's on board. So if everybody's on board, then... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: There's safety in numbers on this one and I think that... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is so you to make us sign a petition. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If it makes you feel better, I'll sign it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm in. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'll take a video. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, a video. That's good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Go. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I agree. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Agreed. &gt;&gt; BURT: Aye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I agree. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I agree absolutely. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agree. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, hold it to me. I agree, so this means that none of us can go back on our word. Putting a putting green in whether my mom likes it or not. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Deal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Deal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is gorgeous. Come on, Bernard. Let's go on your first hike ever. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Are you scared? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew, you farted. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: He's gross. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He is so gross. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Between him and Lamar, my house smells, like, so foul at all times. They're sick. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Thank God you have a candle line. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, sorry I missed your call. I'm up this hill. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: So I talked to Nick. He wants to know if you are gonna cancel the photo shoot for tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did want to cancel. Why, is he giving you, like, a hard time? &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: He just said that he has so many people to pay for labor and he wanted to see if we are doing a yes or no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me just think about it and then I'll let you know, I guess. &gt;&gt; SYDNEY: Okay, perf. Just let me know. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Why are you canceling the shoot? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I'm just not into it anymore. It's, like, not turning out the way I wanted it to be. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Well, that's mean, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, it's my shoot. It's not, like, a magazine that I'm bailing on. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I understand. It's not so much that. Like, why don't you just take the pictures and if you don't like it, Khloe, you scrap them. No one ever sees them. No harm, no foul. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so easy for Malika to say, "Oh, just do the shoot." But now there's so much pressure, it's not this fun, sexy shoot that I wanted to do for me and Lamar. It's now, like, turning into kind of a debacle. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Brody and I were talking and we feel like your golf game is getting really good, and we think that you should go and enter in some more tournaments. Kris is gonna be out of the house, so it buys us a little bit of time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: While the putting green's going in, I really can't be there. A golf tournament-- perfect. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I just wanted to let you know, I've been looking at houses by the beach. This is just for the summer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I appreciate that you went looking. It's not gonna happen. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're being very selfish, but whatever. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mother? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. Wait, can I just ask you a question? I told Kim that this little bassinet situation is great, but it should be bigger. and then I realized we had these extensions, so what do you think? You think we should leave it like this? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kim likes it. Anyways, I wanted to talk to you about something. I don't want you to get mad 'cause I did this to make your life easier. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That sounds like a horrible way to start a conversation. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I have been looking at a ton of places and I finally found one that caught my eye. &gt;&gt; MAN: There's a pool table. There's a fireplace over there. And of course, the beach. Do you like it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I do. I know that my mom already has so much on her plate, so to make it easy on her, I thought that I would get everything in order so that she could just say yes and it would be easy for her. Because there's gonna be so many people in the house, and it's gonna be crazy and it already is, I've been looking at houses by the beach. This is just for the summer. And I just wanted to let you know before I did anything final. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, I appreciate that you went looking. It's not gonna happen. So don't ask again. There's a lot of moving parts in this whole situation. And this whole move. Kendall, she's going to be 18 in a few months and we have to savor each and every moment that we can. So right now I have to just pass on this whole idea. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're not looking at the bigger picture and you're not looking at everything else. You're being very selfish, but whatever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I'm selfish and I'm not looking at the big picture. I get it. I'm good. Love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Nick. &gt;&gt; NICK: Good morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good morning. &gt;&gt; NICK: How are you, superstar? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sleepy. &gt;&gt; NICK: Aw, just sleep. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really did want to cancel my shoot, but Nick put so much time and energy to get this shoot going. The one up-side about this whole thing is that these are my pictures. So if I get these back and I hate them, I can destroy them. So, I mean, I guess that's one way to look at this whole thing. Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So put the right knee in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh. So put pressure on this knee? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Put pressure on the knee. &gt;&gt; MAN: There you go. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Open the fabric a little bit and look. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Peek-a-boo. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: There you go, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I envisioned this photo shoot, like, I wanted to go big or go home, but I just don't feel sexy. I mean, I really just kind of feel like a circus clown reject. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: There you go. &gt;&gt; NICK: Beautiful. We're gonna look at a couple different angles and see what looks the best. How does the mobility feel? Do you think you even got a shot in there or should we do some...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, we can try it. As soon as I get this cat suit on, I have no idea if I'll be able to do these flips and turns. That suit... I could barely walk in my bathroom in it, so I have no idea how I'm gonna accomplish this. &gt;&gt; NICK: Even if her hair hits the ground, it's fine as long as she... it's not hitting a mat. 'Cause I can't paint out the mats. Neck way back, one, two, three. Perfect. Now remember, these are for Lamar, so we need to get... There you go. That's kind of amazing right there. Try going head straight back. Don't even worry about looking at me back. Yeah, yeah, amazing. Yeah, love, love, love, Khloe. Beautiful. Lean towards me, just rotate. Beautiful. Chest slightly towards me. Boom. Lovely. One more. All right, come look. If we got it, you're done. So like I said some of these are exaggerated. If they're too forced, don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's cute. &gt;&gt; NICK: Love the body there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I like the face there. &gt;&gt; NICK: Like that? Oh, my God, are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Yay! &gt;&gt; NICK: How you feel? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love. I love them. I do have to admit coming into the shoot I had all these doubts, but I do really like these photos, and I do look good and sexy. And I'm actually really proud of these pictures. I probably would be so much fun at a water park. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have some really great clothes. Kanye and I looked at these. He sent me a picture. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He bought those for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: He did? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom and I are going to New York. Kanye's performing, and from New York I'm gonna go to Paris, so I think it's the perfect opportunity to invite my mom with me. This gives the boys time to install the putting green. It's perfect. You know what I was thinking? I have that pregnancy shoot that Karl Lagerfeldt is shooting. So since you're already gonna be in New York with me, why don't you just come to Paris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We could go baby shopping. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it'll be so fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is my answer. Yay! Let's go do some dreaming in Paris. You didn't have to twist my arm for too long. Oh, my God, what am I gonna wear? I need more stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, you don't. You have enough stuff. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We saved a spot for you-- we saved it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How's it going? &gt;&gt; JEFF: Hi. Jeff Dunham. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Jeff. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Good to see you. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You guys have never met. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, I heard a lot about you. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Oh... it's all lies. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. This is his car. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: So, Brody and I were talking, and we feel like your golf game is getting really good, and we think that you should go and enter in some more tournaments. Kris is gonna be out of the house, so it buys us a little bit of time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I-I... Golf-- I'm always ready. I have to stay very stealthy with this putting green, and while the putting green's going in, I really can't be there. A golf tournament! Perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, you're gonna drive my car... &gt;&gt; JEFF: No, I'm not driving your car. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And Brandon's gonna drive this one. &gt;&gt; JEFF: Brandon's gonna drive the Bat...? Dude, that's not good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's very Brandon. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JEFF: It is? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Once we get the furniture out of here... &gt;&gt; MAN: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...then we'll work on this. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay? So, this has to go out in the hallway... ...on the racks that they're doing, with this, real quick. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello! Dino's movers! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So how much stuff are you moving out of the house? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's going to storage. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is Kendall and Kylie here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie. Kylie, why are you eating your lunch in the car? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Now that Kim's moving in and it's all hectic, there's literally no quiet place, so I'm eating in my car. Look how quiet it is in here, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There is a lot of people in there, and I have to be really quiet, too. It's inconvenient and it's uncomfortable. There's a lot of people-- I get it. It really breaks my heart that Kylie feels like she has to go to her car just because there's so much chaos in the house. Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; FURNITURE MOVER: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; MAN: Thank you. Have a good day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need a changing table stat. You guys are getting a late start. Can you get as much done today as possible? &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. But now I'm feeling really bad because I feel like I made the wrong decision. When I come home and I see the sod and the equipment, I don't really understand why this could all be happening. What's going on back here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: While I'm up in Las Vegas playing golf, this putting green can go in. 656 00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:09,055 Honestly, it just doesn't get any better than this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's go see your bedroom. Come on. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, hey, bedroom. Lot of great nights with you, guy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Give me a hug. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Right from the beginning, Khloe was just, like, uh... was, like, everything to me. I mean, her taking these photos, it was healthy and spontaneous. It was beautiful with my relationship with Khloe. It goes beyond lovemaking. I love you, yo. 667 00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:46,660 Give me some sugar. Mmm... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall, can you come in my room for a second? Kyles, will you come in my room for a second? I just want to have a little powwow with you guys. So I want to talk to you guys about something because I've been thinking about this, and I feel really bad that things around here are getting a little more, um, you know, crazy. And I don't want you to move out and go away without me because I'll miss you. But on the other hand, it's not fair to you guys to keep you stuffed here, so I've rented a house for the summer. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks, Mom. Mm-mm! &gt;&gt; KRIS: And it doesn't mean that I don't want you guys to go without me because I'm gonna be there whenever I can. Um, and you're not gonna be sleeping there alone because Daddy'll be there, but it'll be a place for you guys and your friends to hang out so that you don't feel like you're trapped. There's just one thing: I want you guys to surprise Daddy. Bruce is away at a golf tournament, and I'm leaving for Paris. And one of the things that I want to accomplish before I leave is setting up this house so that when Bruce comes back from the golf tournament, he's got a big surprise. 690 00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:06,840 Aw, you guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Love you, Mommy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How exciting is this? One of the things that I'm known for amongst all my friends is the way that I move into a house. Everything's unpacked. Every picture's on a wall. Every bed is made. So that at the end of the day, there's not one box standing. It's almost like a challenge, and I love it. This is the thing that I shine at. Hey, Mom. Cici! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This house is out of control. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! &gt;&gt; MARY JO: I have a question for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; MARY JO: Would you mind explaining... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; MARY JO: ...what the hell's going on. &gt;&gt; KRIS:Well, it all started when Kanye and Kim decided to move into... &gt;&gt; MARY JO: Your house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My house. What else is a girl to do? Give me five for figuring it out. 710 00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,392 &gt;&gt; MARY JO: I would never be that calm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had such a good time preparing this house and moving us all in... but the one thing that I'm still bummed about is I won't be here to see Bruce's 715 00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:16,409 reaction because I'll be in Paris. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: So basically our dad drew up this whole area he wanted to basically make. &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: Now that would be a good-sized green. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's big. How long does it take to build this? &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: One this size, probably about a week. We'd remove the grass, we'd put in the base and regrade it to get kind of a flat area. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: Tons and tons of gravel and decomposed granite. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's gonna be really tight. We have barely enough time to get this done. Time is of the essence, so if it means adding a couple people to the crew and stuff... &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: We can do that. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, 'cause we do have, like, kind of a short little time frame for this. &gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: I understand. &gt;&gt; BRODY: We got to stay clear of... you-know-who. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Me and Kendall wanted to surprise you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you kidding me? She decorated the house, too? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You know Mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I honestly don't think it's a good idea to do that putting green right now, especially 'cause Kris doesn't even know it's going in. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's already begun. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's almost done. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing here? You're manipulating this whole situation by the way that you 741 00:32:34,187 --> 00:32:37,290 paint a picture of me, and it's wrong. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good morning, Paris. &gt;&gt; KIM: I kind of like that it's rainy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it makes it magical when it rains here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I always stop right here, like, at these streets by the bridge and we take pictures, like, in the middle of the night. It's actually really fun having my mom here in Paris. And Kanye's finishing up his album, so when he's recording all day, it's good to have someone to just run around Paris with and go sightseeing and do really fun things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, we want to go in Chanel, too, which is right here. 754 00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,299 &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, the Lanvin baby stuff is, like, insane. This is so pretty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right? Gorgeous. The fact that we're in Paris and we're at the Eiffel Tower and it's drizzling-- it's out of a movie. This is crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow, look at how cool this is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. It is the most magical night, and I'm just so happy that I'm spending it with Kim. : Yeah! Look how beautiful that is. It's just stunning. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Me and Kendall wanted to surprise you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whose house is this? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's ours! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you mean it's ours? Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Come on in. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She decorated the house, too? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You know Mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look what happens when I go away for a couple of days. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My clothes are here, your clothes are here. Refrigerator's stocked. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't believe it. Is this my room? Oh, of course. It's a picture of herself. Man. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You don't seem that excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I'm just... I'm kind of a little bit in shock right now. Do you know when Mom's coming back from Paris? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's either the night after tomorrow or tomorrow night. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 'Cause Brandon and the boys are all trying to get this putting green put in the backyard. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have no idea what you're doing, but if Mom doesn't know about it, you should probably call Brandon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, the beach house is great, but now, kind of feeling bad. This putting green's going in, and I'm gonna be out at the beach house all summer. I'm actually kind of wondering if maybe I did the wrong thing and I was a bad boy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: This is Brandon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How's it going? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, I'm in Malibu. Kris leased this beach house-- which is a good thing-- but if we got this place, I honestly don't think it's a good idea to do that putting green right now, especially 'cause Kris doesn't even know it's going in. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, but we've already started building. I mean, this isn't right. This is kind of late notice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, hopefully, not too much is done, and we can, you know, put an 86 to this thing. I'm not saying not do it, but I just don't think we should do it right now. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I mean, it's already begun. The whole process. If it was a week ago, or even a couple days ago, that would be an easy thing to stop, but honestly, I mean, it's not gonna be an easy thing to quit. I mean, that was the original plan. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God. I know. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I understand your concern, but I mean, this is not a small chore. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But we got to put a stop to it. We really do. I mean, Kris will go crazy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'll do whatever I can. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, well, I appreciate what you're doing. Love you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: All right, I love you, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Oh, my God. I'm scared to death. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not just one person's house, or the other person's house. We need, like, a happy medium. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have made not only your kids feel sorry for you, but you've made my kids feel 818 00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:07,533 sorry for you by the way that you paint a picture of me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so, we've run ourselves ragged. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. I'm exhausted. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 12 hours of shop till we drop. I think I'm just gonna get a glass of red French wine and call it a night. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I get that, too? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't like it to begin with, so why would I start now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna start a lot of things now that you didn't like to begin with, now that you're gonna be a mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. What the hell am I gonna do with my life? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I literally had to talk Daddy into having a fourth kid. Did I ever tell you what I did? One night, I came downstairs in a fur coat with nothing on underneath. And he goes, "Why are you wearing a fur coat?" And I just whipped it open and said, "I think it's time to make a boy." He actually laughed because he thought it was funny, and then he went, "Okay." And we got busy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That really happened. 839 00:37:06,626 --> 00:37:11,230 Sometimes a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. &gt;&gt; BRODY: We got to get this out of here. Let's figure out how to get it out of here before Kris is getting back, seriously. Do you know how much longer? You think we can move this? Maybe... Is there anywhere we can put...? How much longer do you guys think you're...? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How long do you think total time? &gt;&gt; MAN: Um, with my other guys, uh, 30 minutes I'll finish. I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: 30 minutes until it's perfect? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yes. Uh, yes, it's perfect. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'm bummed that we lost the putting green. It more symbolized one effort for my dad to make a stand and try to gain some more real estate in his own house. It's just a bummer that he doesn't stand up for himself a bit more. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I can't believe this isn't going down. This would have been incredible. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I know, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Why are we cleaning it up? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got that Malibu house. I'm gonna spend time out there, and I think the last thing in the world Kris wants is a putting green. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, 'cause Mom has protested this for four years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But she doesn't know that we were doing it, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, but she's coming back from Paris. Not a good time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not a good time. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, she's gonna freak out. I mean, it smells like poo back here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So what are we doing now? How are we gonna get all this done? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: These guys are, uh, putting the sod back. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You think? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When does she come back? &gt;&gt; BRODY: She's not supposed to be back for a while. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so confused right now because the last I heard, we were all installing a putting green for Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got about 20 minutes, I think, or a half hour before she gets back, and we want to get it finished up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on back here? CHLOE: How are we gonna get all this done? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Those guys are putting the sod back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When does she come back? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got about 20 minutes, I think, or a half hour before she gets back, and we want to get it finished up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on back here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just doing some yard work. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it looks like a little more than just yard work, you guys. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why'd you come back that way? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because there's a tractor in the driveway. What are you guys doing here? I see the sod and the equipment. I don't really understand why this could all be happening. Why aren't you home? And what's Brandon and Brody doing here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We can't be at our parents' house? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I think the most important thing is, it's all gonna go back to normal. I'm not gonna lie to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Better... You have better grass. &gt;&gt; BRODY: We were gonna build a putting green. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They had nothing but good intentions. I've been trying for what, for years since we've lived here, to get a putting green in here. They thought I should have a putting green. But, with getting that Malibu house, and I'm not spending as much time here, I just said, "No." &gt;&gt; KRIS: What bothers me about this whole thing... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...is that you guys would feel like you have to do something and not tell me about it... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, absolutely. That is an absolute fact. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...because you think that I'm like the Wicked Witch of the West. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Isn't it, guys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't piss her off more, please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My point is, I've wanted to do everything that you've ever wanted ever in your life for 23 years. But you're making me look like I'm the bad person because I don't want you to have a putting green, so I'm not giving you enough space... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, we'll say... Kris? Kris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and all you have are these little parts of the house. I've given you huge parts of the house, and you don't give a ... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Jetlag is sinking in. Shh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not just one person's house or the other person's house. We need, like, a happy medium. And we're sorry if you feel like we went behind your back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, but we're gonna fix it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I just feel like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? Oh, please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...the reason you have to go behind my back is 'cause of the way he paints me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Please, please. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm sorry. We... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I feel bad. I really do; I feel bad. The last thing we wanted to do is create any kind of tension. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just the way that you guys look at me sometimes. You, too, Khloe. Like, because he tells one side of a story, so you start to... He's like a victim half the time. "I'm the victim." He's not a victim. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: As my husband and my partner and the mother of your kids, you should be painting a picture of me that's A): Honest, and B): Represents the true spirit of my personality. You're manipulating this whole situation, and you're making me look bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But I'm doing absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have made not only your kids feel sorry for you, but you've made my kids feel sorry for you by the way that you paint a picture of me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris's and my relationship has been pretty interesting along the way. I'm so easygoing that I just let her do a lot of things, and sometimes, she does too many things and takes too much control. At this point in our relationship, I think it's extremely important that I take some of that control back. How I do that right now, I don't know, but it's mostly an attitude change in the way I deal with her. I felt like I've lost control on the whole relationship, and slowly, trying to get it back is kind of tough. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love them all for trying to do something nice to you, because I want you to have your heart's desire. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'm proud of my dad. In a weird way, this has actually all been for the good, because now he has a reason to approach Kris and talk to her about an issue that I think is... has been hanging over their heads for quite some time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I should have, at the beginning, probably been a little stronger and make it a little bit more 50-50, you know? But, you're very strong, so I've kind of backed off. I back off, back off, back off, back off, back off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're only not strong in front of other people. You're very strong, Bruce. When you want to have an opinion, you're very strong. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, no, well, not with you, not with you. You're right-- no, no, no, I'm not, I'm not at all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, actually, it's... You're not. That's not true. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want people to think of her as a bad person. Kris is really a great person, and we've had a great relationship for many years. And it's gonna take a little work. I don't know if you can go that direction. Uh, I hope you can, but I'm gonna try. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sorry that I... &gt;&gt; ROB: Little too dramatic for nothing. It's just grass, brand-new grass you just got. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, you know what? Sometimes... I'm sorry I overreacted, but he always makes me look like an ..., and I don't want to be the ... I don't want you guys to feel like you have to hide stuff. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I think we have it a little backwards here, too, where you think that we think that he's being treated unfairly. I don't think it's that at all. I think that he doesn't stick up for himself enough sometimes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: And I think that's the main issue. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want to love each other and have a great life together... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and let him have everything he wants. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't think anyone hates anyone, so... &gt;&gt; BRODY: We messed up a little bit, we did. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, love you. &gt;&gt; BRODY: We'll take the blame. &gt;&gt; ROB: Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you guys. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRODY: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, well... &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, I'm sorry.

The intent was amazing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Thank you for understanding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Brody gets me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't suck up to her, Brody. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's me. It's Todd Cranes. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have planned out our final Todd Cranes prank. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Todd Cranes is at the gate. What if it's thefake Todd Cranes? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Toffers are so in right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: They are? I'm getting really concerned that I'm losing my cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look ridiculous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It would mean a lot to me if there was a little connection between you and my mother. &gt;&gt; ESTHER: I have never felt that I did reach out to Kris. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've had no relationship with her, so it's not like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: She has yelled at me. She doesn't even like me.
