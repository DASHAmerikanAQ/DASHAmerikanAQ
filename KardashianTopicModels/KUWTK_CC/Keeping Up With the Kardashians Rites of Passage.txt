- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Previously on... &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I'm supposed to go out to lunch with Scott, and I just wanted to make sure that I had your blessing before I just go have lunch with him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sure. He can come over. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The whole thing was an open door policy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That has changed. His main concern is himself. He flaked on the kids' first day of school. You, like, partied through the next day, just like a real ♫ ♫ I can't wait for the day that we can all hang out together, do things with the kids as a family, but he's not in that place right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, would it be okay if he went by and put Mason to bed tonight and P? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sure, if he was there when they get home to have dinner at 5:30, sit and have dinner with them... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Anything else, boss? You want me to fold any of your clothes or anything? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can you not commit to going for, like, two and a half hours? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, we're gonna hang up now, but he'll be over there about 5:30. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love you, too. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you gonna go put Mason to bed tonight? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. This wholeis so weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going to Florida. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're going to Florida? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: In a couple hours. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. If that was my window to spend with my kids, I'd go enjoy my window. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's like, "All right, sit with your kid, eat dinner with your kid, put your kid to sleep, and then get out." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Listen, but it's part of the price that you're gonna have topay for this whole thing. You have to earn back trust that you've lost. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. It's just... it's just not as easy as it sounds. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not gonna be easy, but you have to fight for what you want. You don't just talk about it. You have to show your actions. I have to be honest with you, part of love is being honest, and you reallyup. Look, she's trying to make sure the kids don't get disappointed, and she's angry, because they've been disappointed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you want me to do? I mean... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want you to see your kids. I want you to be a full-time, committed, kick-ass, fabulous dad. They miss you. They need you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm... No. I don't disagree with any of that. It's just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: 35 years from now, just like my kids talk about Robert, I want your kids to have that same respect for you to know that "No matter what, my dad never wavered on his love for us, no matter what." And that's all that matters. Nothing else matters. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I guess. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, you got to go see the kids. I'm sure you're sick of listening to me. Take your little gift you're gonna bring them, and I love you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can we regroup in the morning? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go have dinner, put them to bed, okay? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we'll start over tomorrow with a plan. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Love you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo, are you the new Kris Jenner? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? What happened? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: First of all, this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, what's wrong with that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not organic. Then what, what, what, what is going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have guests here. It's not just about me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This and this and this. What?! Now I can't even eat your fruit here, 'cause I'm not gonna trust it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you joking? &gt;&gt; KIM: I dissect your closet. She dissects your fridge. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's all organic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, don't sit like that. Your boobs are so huge. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but they're so awesome. Well, anyway, I called Kourt the other day, because I got woken up because-- you know how, like, I'm kind of, like, psychic? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ish. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, psychic... psychic-ish. And the other day when I was sleeping, something woke me up. It whispered in my ear. It was going, "Khlo, Khlo." When I heard it, it was a familiar voice to me. It was male. &gt;&gt; KIM: Was it young or old? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was just comfortable. Like, I wasn't scared. I am very spiritual. I like that I have senses. I'm in tune with certain things, and I would like to learn about these feelings or spirits. But when I woke up, I kept my eyes shut, 'cause I was a little scared, and then, like, nothing was there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Aww. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is what you eat? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not allowed to have peanut butter and celery? What's wrong with that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Kay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me see what's in this. Contains two percent molasses, fully hydron... hydrogate... Huh? God, I know this word. I can't say it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hydrogenated. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, they put the tile samples up? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like the way that the smaller ones are wider. I think you'd have to do that too narrow, but you're almost a college graduate. Wait, you're almost a high school graduate, so you should know the difference. &gt;&gt; KYLIE:So I have one week left of school. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A week? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then you're done? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You graduate? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 12th grade. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been so preoccupied with everything else going on, I just figured you had a couple months to go. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I'm done in one week. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How does that feel? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Feels good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? For the last six months, I truly have not been myself, and when it comes to my kids, I've been slacking a little bit. And I feel bad about where my head has been, and I've got to get it together. My baby's growing up. You gonna invite me over for dinner? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm just kidding. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, can I talk to you guys about something? You guys, will you pay attention to me for, like, 24 seconds? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys? Okay, when you're finished taking all your selfies... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You pushed the wrong button! That was the best picture. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, this is important! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like a warrior. A warrior! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I get it. I got it good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I feel like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, the pineapple. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mommy! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason. Okay, what, what? What do you want to tell us? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm feeling really bad, because Kylie graduates from high school. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And Kendall graduated and never had a graduation ceremony. I think we should surprise them and have, like, a surprise graduation party and a ceremony and get, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But how do you have a graduation? They walk down an aisle or something? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We'll make our own... We'll make our own. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How fun would that be? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And we'll have their diplomas there, caps and gowns, and we could have a speaker. Like, a commencement speaker. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, I could give one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not you. Even though I've been dealing with my own problems and issues for the last six months, I just really want to celebrate Kendall and Kylie. Lately, they've been through a lot in life, but they have tremendous, big hearts, great work ethic, and they really deserve to be celebrated. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mason! Why are you screwing with me? My butt is numb, literally. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would he only do it to me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause look at your butt. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My new thing is I'm into no-makeup makeup, 'cause I cannot stand the crazy contour. The highlight, the highlight cheeks, the lashes. Aren't you supposed to look pretty and not like a clown? &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: Hey, how are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: Kim, good to see you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Am I in your seat? &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: No, you're fine right there. Kim, how are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm good, how are you? &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: I'm good. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm starting to get fat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's a good thing, isn't it? &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: This is to be expected, okay? Scoot on down a little bit. So today I'm looking for growth of the pregnancy, okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, you know how Kim had "preclampsha" last time? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it's called preeclampsia. &gt;&gt; KIM: Preeclampsia. &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: Preeclampsia, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is there a way to, like, avoid that? &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: So, it's hard to say; once you have preeclampsia, you are at risk for having it again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim really had a miserable pregnancy the first time. She would get crazy headaches and abdominal pain. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, that kills. It feels like I'm in labor. Why is this happening to me? It hurts when I cry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really want to make sure that she stays healthy so that she has an enjoyable pregnancy, because my experiences were so wonderful, and I would love the same for her. &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: Congrats. Looking wonderful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This makes me want to do it again. Such a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: Okay? Congratulations. Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; DR. HUANG: Okay? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mmm, I love breakfast. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, they have breakfast anytime. Do you want to get your Mickey Mouse pancakes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is your mother? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's always late. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ah, Mason's here. Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Mase. Mason, can you say hello to me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mase, say hi to Lovey. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hi, Lovey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good job! Let's talk about the graduation. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, have you even looked over the list of RSVPs to see who's coming? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you inviting Caitlyn? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think I'm ready. I don't think I-I can even handle that yet. I'm just trying to process it, not alienate anybody. I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings and I don't want to hurt Kendall and Kylie. But at the same time, I need time as well to adjust to this whole thing and I'm just trying to be honest. I'd like to get to a place where, you know, our family is our family... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...but at the same time I haven't even met her yet, and I'm not sure-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: To be honest, I'm scared to death. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am gonna go to Paris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why do you need to go to Paris? You're trying to do everything that would make the normal, non-pregnant person exhausted. This is gonna put you over the edge. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Hello, how are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Great to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have been really eager to meet with Tyler, who is a medium. &gt;&gt; TYLER: It was kind of an odd feeling right when I walked in. It was like there was a feeling like there was something here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'd like to get to a place where, you know, our family is our family, but at the same time, I haven't even met her yet, and I'm not sure-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: To be honest, I'm scared to death. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have no idea. The graduation party is about celebrating Kendall and Kylie's amazing achievement and I don't want anything to distract the attention from Kendall and Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Should we tell Cait that we're not inviting her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We should probably say you're throwing this party and you're just not ready yet to have her there and we don't want you to be offended. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're allowed to be honest. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't think we say anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's obviously gonna know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I just don't want to make a big deal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going to get a piercing. Do you want to come with us? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to get one. But there's no way I would ever do it. I remember getting my ears pierced. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, you told me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I hid in Ruby's. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ruby's is the restaurant. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yum! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cheat day? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, chili cheese fries. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oreo shakes-- oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, divine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Tyler's here. Hi. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Hello, how are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Great to meet you. I'm Tyler. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khloe. Thank you for coming. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Oh, oh, my gosh, thank you, this is beautiful. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, thank you. I have been really eager to meet with Tyler, who is a medium. He's still young. He's 19, I think. These are my sisters. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Oh, my gosh. Great to meet you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You, too. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Hi, great to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; TYLER: I actually know your cousin Kara. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He works with my cousin all the time, so I feel like there's a family connection and almost it's like cosmic that I'm supposed to be meeting with him. &gt;&gt; TYLER: The general idea of how I do what I do is that I actually work as a clairvoyant, so I see information. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Um, as opposed to audibly hearing it, I get visuals. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you always know that you had, like, a gift? &gt;&gt; TYLER: When I was ten years old, my grandmother was ill with terminal cancer, and as she was getting really ill, I woke up one night and knew she was going to pass and we got the call two minutes later that my grandmother had passed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, wow. &gt;&gt; TYLER: And so, that's kind of, uh, was a pretty dramatic moment, but I believe we all have an intuition, but to varying extents. &gt;&gt; KIM: She always tells me she's psychic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I don't think I, like, could read her palm, but I have a very great intuition. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Sure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I feel energies and spirits really well. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I'm not saying, "Oh, my God, there's a ghost in the corner!" &gt;&gt; TYLER: Right, right, right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I know when I feel something and I, like, pay that respect. &gt;&gt; TYLER: I think our intuition is almost like a compass that we have inside of us, and if we go with it, it can really drastically improve our life, so-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And if I haven't, like, how you see things or whatever, if I, that hasn't happened to me yet, like, would that never happen to me? &gt;&gt; TYLER: It's one of those things that you don't have to embrace, but if you chose to embrace it and chose to kind of connect and not be afraid of it, that's the biggest thing. Fear is the quickest way to shut something down. You definitely do have that really keen intuition. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does she? &gt;&gt; TYLER: I would say both of you, out of you two, probably the strongest for you two. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel that about you. I don't feel it about you. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Also interesting to note, this house has something in it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; TYLER: I don't know. It's kind of an odd feeling. Right when I walked in, it was like there was a feeling like there was something here. This is one of those weird things that's kind of coming through. I'm referencing-- maybe I'm smelling a tie? I don't know what this would be. You know ties, like, for work? I'm pulling it out, but I'm holding it my face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if it's Dad? My dad had hundreds of ties and I'd always smell his stuff. Like, I have a jacket and his shirts and I haven't ever washed them and I just always, like, smell them. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw... &gt;&gt; TYLER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sometimes when people die, their spirit might be lingering around because they feel like there's unfinished business. And, you know, there's a lot of things that obviously I wish I did differently when my dad was dying and I would avoid seeing my dad a lot, because I would rather not see him like that and I kind of wanted to act like it wasn't happening. &gt;&gt; TYLER: But I believe our loved ones really are okay and that they do give us signs. And that they are definitely aware of the big events that we go through on some level. I don't claim to know how it works, but we all have an intuition and it all comes through in lots of different ways. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's new for her, 'cause she used to think I was ridiculous and then when I-- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No I didn't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but now when I start telling her things, she'll be like, "Oh, okay," like, she'll like... &gt;&gt; TYLER: Yeah, mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...come over and entertain me and like, this one's like, "Yeah, oh, okay, whatever," like, she's kind of like, "Sure, whatever." ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are we sitting-- here? I just kept on saying, if I get pregnant again, I'm treating myself to a night of good meals. The food in New Orleans is so amazing. And I've been doing so good. I work out all the time. I've been eating so healthy. So I decided to go for it and fly across the country to satisfy my pregnancy cravings and I'm gonna have a cheat day and eat whatever I want to eat. Do you think I-I should post that and say I'm faking my pregnancy? &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: By the way, the lights in New Orleans would get shut off if you post that. Just do it after we eat, so there's no blackout here. 'Cause I need mycrab fingers. &gt;&gt; MAN: It be so funny! &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you guys have the crab fingers? &gt;&gt; WAITER: We do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I for myself get a double order? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's, like, we flew into town for this. You have no idea. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Mmm, so good. Is this, like, a Sriracha sauce? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is worth the trip. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know Jonathan. This is, like, what he's been dying for. It is so worth it. This food is so good. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is so good. &gt;&gt; KIM: And if I'm gonna enjoy myself, I need someone that's really gonna indulge and Jonathan, he's, like, more of a foodie than I am. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I was with her the last day, the day she gave birth. I pushed her into the car and I, like, shoved her in and she was, like, literally this big. Everything-- she was, like, honking with her stomach and boobs. I swear to God, through the hills and we're driving, I go, "Slow down, you're freaking me out," and she was like... &gt;&gt; KIM: And I was all dressed up. I am so full. My whole outfit doesn't zip up. ♫ ♫ You want to sit and have a beignet? &gt;&gt; FRIEND: Sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I just feel like, every time in New Orleans, I have to stop and have beignets. They are, like, everything to me. They're my most favorite dessert ever. Yeah, do you think we're gonna be able to eat... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...in privacy? I think we should get it to go, 'cause this is, like, a little crazy. &gt;&gt; FRIEND: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're gonna order it to go, actually. &gt;&gt; FAN: Hi, Kim! Love you! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Mason downloads these things on my phones, and they make these noises at all times. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, we thought that was your stomach. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I got it to make this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, if that was her stomach, we would have to, like... take her to the hospital. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I heard a little squeal. &gt;&gt; KIM: That was not me, there. That was, like, a fart noise. But it does this all the time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Close the app. &gt;&gt; KIM: In New Orleans, I went to Café Du Monde and got beignets three times. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you remember what happened the last time you got all stressed out and you were eating sugary stuff? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am way skinnier than last time and way healthier than last time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're eating beignets. Three times a day. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. That was one trip, for one day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was in the kitchen this morning. You had your chef making the beignets, because you brought home the beignet mix. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, and he doesn't make them as good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what you are? You're, like, a closet eater. You need an ankle bracelet. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I don't. 'Cause I eat so much healthier than I did before. I am gonna go to Paris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why do you need to go to Paris? Is it... &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause I want to go to Paris to have a fitting to get some good pregnancy clothes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can't somebody come here? &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't have every designer fly to L.A., no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is gonna put you over the edge. Kim has been traveling a lot and I don't think she understands that, you know, she's got to take care of herself. You're trying to do everything that would make the normal, non-pregnant person exhausted. I'm just telling you you've got to be careful. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to see my ghost detector? Ah! It just jumped! Hold it and go over there. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You have elevated blood pressure. &gt;&gt; KIM: After Paris, my feet and my hands completely swelled up. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: I really hope it's not diabetes. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, actually scared. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Is there anything that you think would look good on me for the AMAs? &gt;&gt; OLIVIER: Yes. I think that girly-girl thing from the last resort. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; OLIVIER: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And this is how we prep for my fashion fittings. I'm in Paris having a bunch of fittings to try and get some really cool pregnancy looks. But, of course, I've been, like, dreaming about the food in Paris. Anyone that knows me knows that, like, churros are my thing and Ferdi has the best churros I've ever had in my life. I really came to Paris to eat. I have no regrets. Like, this is... &gt;&gt; OLIVIER: So after the churros, what is the plan? &gt;&gt; KIM: You didn't know? We're gonna break in the store in the middle of the night and steal what fits me after this. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MASON: Could I have some water, Mommy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I... can I... Can you just sit with me for a minute? You're just the cutest boy in the world, besides Reign. You and Reign are in a tie. How cute is this? &gt;&gt; MASON: I wish it was real. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is real. How do you know, at night, it doesn't come to life? &gt;&gt; MASON: At night, it does. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; MASON: Farting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. You know we're girls, right? We don't do farting. We do unicorns. &gt;&gt; MASON: Farting unicorns. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Okay, do you want to see my ghost detector? Come on, let's show Mom where the energy is. It's right by that... the outside of my door. I would love to be able to connect with my dad or the other side on some sort of level, so I bought this EMF detector and I don't know, really, if it's gonna work or not, but... if he wants to reach out to me, I'll know it. Look! Mase. Okay, look over here. It's over on this side. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When I go to where I said the ghost is, look. You did this on purpose? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. How could I? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney! This is where I feel it! All the time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, go by your bed now. Let's see. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, it's going down! Just look. It's going down. Are you doing this on purpose? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know why you're laughing. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yay! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yay, we found him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It just jumped! No, do it. Hold it and go over there. I was so right. Like, I know I feel... I don't feel the way I feel because I'm, like, alunatic. I'm not crazy! Now what do we do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We could get a professional to come check it out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like who? A Ghostbuster? Wouldn't that be amazing, if I was able to have, like, a channel to my dad and, like, talk to him about a lot of the stuff that's going on in our lives? That would just be awesome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do Ghostbusters exist? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There has to be a Ghostbuster. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: This is exactly what we needed before our fitting. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I've been here before. &gt;&gt; JENKE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: With Kanye, one time. &gt;&gt; ALEXANDRE: Yeah, absolutely. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, how are you? &gt;&gt; ALEXANDRE: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's all coming back to me. I love, love, love your stuff. &gt;&gt; ALEXANDRE: Yeah, and you wear it very well, absolutely. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I try this on? &gt;&gt; ALEXANDRE: Yeah, of course! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, no, it could be a really good pregnancy look. &gt;&gt; ALEXANDRE: It's super nice in black. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I love this. ♫ ♫ Plus that. It's so comfy. &gt;&gt; ALEXANDRE: Enjoy your... your evening Paris. &gt;&gt; KIM: For sure. &gt;&gt; ALEXANDRE: Ciao. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're gonna get the best stuff. &gt;&gt; JENKE: Yes! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. Successful trip. ♫ ♫ You don't understand, I flew all the way from L.A. to Paris for this cheesecake. It's my favorite in the world. Anyone that lives in Paris goes to Hôtel Costes for the cheesecake. I dream of this cheesecake. You have no idea. I just love it. Like, when you're pregnant, all the rules go out the door. Like, you just can't control yourself. Burning every calorie, every bite and I eat cheesecake, that's my thing. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whose white phone is this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Any dick pics with you and Corey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. Give me the phone, Khloe. Khloe, give me the phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whatevs, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why does he wear a wedding ring? Kourtney... &gt;&gt; KRIS: He doesn't wear a wedding ring. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's this hand. This is your wedding ring. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He usually wears it on the other hand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, not in this photo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I can't control everybody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you secretly married? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, that's me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, give it back. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, don't go through her messages with Corey. What if she went through your messages with Lamar or James? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would punch you in your face, but that's a different story. Mom doesn't have the balls to punch me in my face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Watch me. So, we need a theme. What if we all wore caps and gowns? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. That takes away from... &gt;&gt; KIM: We're not graduating. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...the graduates. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so they'll wear caps and gowns. They walk up here and then we have somebody give the "commencement speech..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aren't you going a little over-the-top? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. They didn't get a graduation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know what happened at my graduation? No one threw me any graduation anything. Do you remember, there was a brand-new car outside with a bow on it and Dad was like, "Here's your gift!" and it was for someone else? He goes, "Why would I get you that? You went to home school." And I started crying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can anybody give me any input besides the... Because everybody's got to do something, I'm not gonna do the whole thing by myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, if I were to graduate, I would want, probably, like, a petting zoo here. I would want, like, at least two unicorns. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Petting zoos are not fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God... She had a unicorn when she got engaged! You brought her a unicorn. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, we could have mermaid acrobatics! Doing, uh, synchronized swimming. It's a whole dance with lighting, while we're gonna walk down the aisle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Synchronized swimming I like. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: With mermaids. I never got a graduation party and my mom is being so extravagant, I figured, why not get some of my wishes in there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys get really cranky in the afternoon. FYI. Hormones. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She is a walking hormone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have hormones, 'cause I'm breastfeeding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have hormones 'cause I'm just hormonal. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; DR. BRADLEY: All right, so we're gonna start your ultrasound, Kim. And take a peek. And see whether or not there's any areas of abnormality. &gt;&gt; KIM: After getting back from Paris, my feet and my hands completely swelled up, and I am worried and really scared. &gt;&gt; DR. BRADLEY: Right now, overall, it looks good. There might be a little thinning in one area, but the placenta continues to grow and spread out. Now tell me a little bit about what happened in your last delivery. &gt;&gt; KIM: I had preeclampsia. &gt;&gt; DR. BRADLEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I delivered six weeks early. &gt;&gt; DR. BRADLEY: So that was about 33, 34 weeks? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, like, right at 34 weeks. &gt;&gt; DR. BRADLEY: Okay. Okay. Did your blood pressure come down right after delivery? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; DR. BRADLEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I'm ten pounds heavier this time. Isn't that crazy? &gt;&gt; DR. BRADLEY: So a little information in general is you have elevated blood pressure. &gt;&gt; KIM: I hope it's not diabetes. &gt;&gt; DR. BRADLEY: There are several blood tests that we can do to look for that condition. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: To know that I might have another health issue really kind of freaks me out. &gt;&gt; DR. BRADLEY: You have a higher risk for it to happen in the next pregnancy, so we have to watch. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, actually scared. &gt;&gt; LISA: Okay, it feels very masculine. It's just a masculine energy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Masculine, yes. That's what I feel. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, I'm gonna actually ask to step back a little bit. Only because I'm gonna ask the spirit to come forward. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: They saw more fluid than normal, which could mean I have diabetes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's very serious. Your life is at stake. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your boobs are humongous. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, it's also a different kind of bra that I'm wearing, where my bra usually is a minimizer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Looks like a basketball. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Two basketballs. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How was the doctor? &gt;&gt; KIM: Doc? Well, they saw a little bit more fluid than normal in my placenta, which either could mean that I'm having a carbon tolerance... or I have diabetes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Gosh, I hope you don't have diabetes. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not gonna think about that too much. I'm just not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had gestational diabetes with Kylie. It's very serious. Your-your life is at stake. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is so frustrating that I could possibly have diabetes. I think this is just a wake-up call that, you know, things just might not be going the way that I thought they were and that I just need to try to be healthy. She said she would just try to add more protein into my diet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ugh, that freaks me out. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, just the anxiety now that I have until I deliver. And then otherwise, she said my baby is at, like, the 95 percentile of height. I'm like, "Are you sure that's my kid?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, can I ask you a question? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I know you have eggs left over, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What if you don't want to have another baby? &gt;&gt; KIM: So either I'll give 'em to Khloe and see how much she'll buy them off of me for... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna sell your eggs to your sister? &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you imagine? It's a Kanye West baby. It's a lot more expensive. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I really wanted to go to a Kevin Hart show. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When was it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It was, like, last month, but I guess he has another one coming up, but it's, like, four hours away. Have you ever spoken to a medium? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Are you nervous? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, yeah, I don't I'll have anything to be talked about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What makes you exempt? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know. A medium connects with someone from the dead, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's gonna walk through the house. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause you think it's haunted. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, the house isn't haunted, there's a difference. There's spirits that occupy the the residence at times. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm scared now. &gt;&gt; LISA: Khloe and Kendall, Lisa... &gt;&gt; KHLOE AND KENDALL: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're so excited. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, I saw you've got some activity. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I... I think we do. After what I found with Kourtney, my friends hooked me up with Lisa Williams, who is a medium, to help verbally communicate with the spirit in my house. &gt;&gt; LISA: How it works is I'm gonna pick up on the energy. And I'll just go into different areas... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; LISA: ...and I'll tell you what I'm picking up. I kind of really want to go up in that direction. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go, sister. &gt;&gt; LISA: So up... Let's go up here. I'm drawn over in this direction, 'cause there's energy here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get it in my bedroom, but also right in that door...way that we were. &gt;&gt; LISA: In that... Where we were? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, that's where I feel it heavily. &gt;&gt; LISA: 'Cause it-it's... it was feeling coming from here. And then going through here. Let me just look. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like we're on some kind of hunt. &gt;&gt; LISA: 'Cause it's just... it was here though, and I thought as though it was coming from... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe it's running from you 'cause I'm not alone. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, I'm gonna actually ask to step back a little bit. Only because I'm gonna ask the spirit to come forward. Okay, it feels very, um, masculine. This feels masculine, this is a masculine energy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Masculine, yes. That's what I feel. &gt;&gt; LISA: Were you close to a grandfather? Has a grandfather crossed over? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; LISA: He's just said, "Can you say hello to your mom? Tell her I'm okay. Tell her I'm always watching over her." &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; LISA: He loves the music that's often played, so I feel as though there's always music that's played. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I play music every day in my house. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, do you? Okay. Well, he loves the fact that you just hang around and dance and sing to it, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; LISA: Um, but, uh, can you not sing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I can't sing. &gt;&gt; LISA: It's just that... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't tell on me. Geez. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, busted. But he's doing okay. He really is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, good. I am really happy to hear that it's my grandfather who is talking to me. It makes me feel good to know that he's watching over me and doing okay. &gt;&gt; LISA: Any questions? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I mean, if you, like, if I want to talk to someone, can you...? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I was gonna... That's what I was gonna... &gt;&gt; LISA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? Who do you want to talk to? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Your dad. I don't know if you... &gt;&gt; LISA: Do you want me to? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LISA: Do you want to sit down somewhere real...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, let's go sit. &gt;&gt; LISA: All right. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is that a thing, though? Can you try and reach out to someone? &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, no, I can, absolutely. All right. Do you want to know everything? &gt;&gt; MAN: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. I just got tested for diabetes. &gt;&gt; MAN: I have your results on my desk here. &gt;&gt; MAN 2: They're here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're here? This is such an amazing step in the girls' lives, and I really, really hope that they're surprised. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Shut theup. They're coming. &gt;&gt; ALL: Surprise! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; LISA: Do you want to know everything? The way that he's coming through is-is a great deal of energy. You talk to him often. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; LISA: Why is he celebrating July? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: July. &gt;&gt; LISA: Ask your mom. I think your mom might know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; LISA: And also there's a tattoo. Who's got the tattoo to commemorate your dad? Um, I'm not sure if it's his initials or, like, handwriting or words-- it's something very simple. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do. &gt;&gt; LISA: Okay, there you go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's his handwriting. &gt;&gt; LISA: Right, 'cause he's acknowledging the tattoo that commemorates him as well. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That's so cool. &gt;&gt; LISA: He's also sorry he never got a chance to say good-bye. He's just said he loves you with all his heart. He loves you to the moon and back. He's so proud of you. He's so proud of the family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My dad and I were really, really, really close. And I believe all of our blessings that we have now are because we have a guardian angel, which is my dad, by our sides. And, I mean, I pray to my dad every day. Talk to him every single day. And so to finally hear him talk back, like, is just beyond words. It's like a dream. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My dad and Papa Harry said hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How do you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We were with a psychic at my house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I talk to those two all the time. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's in July that my dad's celebrating? &gt;&gt; KRIS: July 8, my anniversary. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My mom is confirming basically everything that this girl said, and that's kind of freaky. I mean, thinking back to it, she definitely was saying some legit things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And the person who whispers in my ear, that's Papa Harry. And he is super happy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Everybody's having more fun than we are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But that's what she was saying. She's like, for us, 'cause we miss the attachment of being with someone, but you're just way happier in Heaven, so, like, we get lonely, but they're straight chillin'. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Chillin'. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. Can I help you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. It's Kim Kardashian West. I just wanted to see if you guys got the results back from my blood test. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, hold on. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just got tested for diabetes, and just to know that there could be issues is scary. &gt;&gt; DR. CRANE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; DR. CRANE: I have your results on my desk here. &gt;&gt; DR. CRANE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; DR. CRANE: I have your results on my desk here. Are you really that freaked out about it or is that just getting to the news? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm dying to see if I have diabetes. &gt;&gt; DR. CRANE: I can say this. You never know who's gonna have really have those kind of problems, but you did pass the diabetes test. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank God. I mean, I felt really relieved that I don't have diabetes. I have been eating bad, so I'm trying to do everything that I can to eat healthy and be healthy. &gt;&gt; DR. CRANE: So I'm gonna see you what-- in two weeks? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Okay, that sounds great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Perfect. &gt;&gt; DR. CRANE: All right, Kim-- &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll talk to you soon. Thank you. &gt;&gt; DR. CRANE: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! They're gonna die. Hi! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, I'm so excited about the photo booth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, Mase! Yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you for coming. They'll be so surprised. &gt;&gt; PIA: Oh, my God, I'm so I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; PIA: This is so cool-- the hot dog stand and everything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, and then we have the sushi bar. And there's a great deejay. We're about to get drinking. It's the day of the graduation party, and I'm super excited. You look beautiful. Look at you! &gt;&gt; QUINCY: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; QUINCY: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You'll tell us when they're, like, close, right? Are you dancing? &gt;&gt; RYAN: Welcome to the party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hi! &gt;&gt; RYAN: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good, how are you? This is so funny. They're gonna die. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Oh, my God, it's gonna be great. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I never got a graduation anything, so everyone! &gt;&gt; RYAN: I know, I know, I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's so mean. So will you just shout me out? &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah, I might give you a little love. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, they came through the gate-- quiet. This is such an amazing step in the girls' lives, and I really, really hope that they're surprised. Shh, shut theup. They're coming! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, the language. &gt;&gt; MAN: They're here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're here? Okay, everyone stand up. When they walk through the door, I want a "surprise" as loud as you can. Shh! &gt;&gt; ALL: Surprise! &gt;&gt; MAN: They're here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're here? Okay, everyone stand up. When they walk through the door, I want a "surprise" as loud as you can. Shh! &gt;&gt; ALL: Surprise! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is so weird! What is happening? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think so. It's amazing! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Welcome to your graduation! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It is such an awesome feeling seeing everybody and it means so much that my mom put this together. I would've never planned a graduation for myself and I just think it's really sweet and I'll remember it forever. Hey, I would've worn something so much cuter if I knew this was my graduation. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey, hi. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Let's get the party started. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is so adorable. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Welcome to your graduation ceremony. To make it official, we have a cap and gown for both of you. So Kris is going to escort you to the graduation wardrobe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, ladies. &gt;&gt; RYAN: And you'll come back with a cap and gown and we'll see your face, all right? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm so confused. This is so funny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You look so cute. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Someone said, "Is Kylie having a graduation? I got invited." And I said, "No!" &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? Wait, someone said that to me, too. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Someone said that to me and I was like, "No." The graduation party was really sweet and really cute. A little bit late, but really sweet and really cute. Grab me heels, Kylie, come in! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Just wear those. Who cares? &gt;&gt; RYAN: Khloe, you did make a point of, uh, saying that you have not graduated yet, so-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I graduated. &gt;&gt; RYAN: You didn't have your ceremony? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, nobody cared. &gt;&gt; RYAN: So, we have a cap and gown for you as well, yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, Khloe. Khloe, come with me. Come on, Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's my graduation party, too. I do feel bad I was giving my mom such a hard time, because now I'm a part of this extravaganza! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the graduates of 2014 and 2015, Kendall and Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: The music? I can't. &gt;&gt; RYAN: And up next, graduate Khloe Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay, Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! Yes! Yes! &gt;&gt; RYAN: Esteemed guests, we are gathered here today to celebrate a victory. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is amazing! &gt;&gt; RYAN: It's more than an ending, it's also a beginning; a celebration of what's to come. We have the perfect person to give you the commencement speech. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, all right, okay, okay. Okay, well, I wasn't gonna say anything, because all I ever do up here is cry. I just want to say that-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There you go, there you go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See, this is why I don't do this. I'm just really proud of you guys. I'm proud of your hearts. Just keep reaching for the stars, because you can have anything that you set your hearts to and I know that if anybody can do it, you guys can, because you've already proven to all of us that you're rock stars. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I love you guys so much. And I think we should go outside and have a drink! &gt;&gt; KIM: I am always in such awe of my mom and how she makes every kid feel so special. Her throwing this party is such a cool thing for her to do for Kendall and Kylie and, you know, I think my mom's just such a good example for me of the kind of mom that I want to be and the kind of attention I want to give my kids. And I'm so glad that I have her there as my role model. &gt;&gt; MAN: One, two, three! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys, there's synchronized swimmers! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So much fun! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is for you. And you, missy, because I'm proud of you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thanks, Mom! I love you! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, thank you! I graduated and I'm partying! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so proud of you. You're such a good person and that's all that matters to me. You're my heart, okay? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This party is just like a celebration of all of our lives and us as a family and that we will always be okay. We always will. &gt;&gt; KIM: On the next episode... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is that? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're doing a good workout. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think we need boundaries. Definitely we need some boundaries. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kanye just, like, loves being here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They both do! I haven't even met Caitlyn. I don't know if I could handle it. &gt;&gt; KIM: With Kylie's birthday coming up, I hope they can just put their differences aside. article killed me. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: What did I say? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you kidding?! &gt;&gt; KIM: Caitlyn is late. This is rude. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm starting to get nervous if she'll even show up.
