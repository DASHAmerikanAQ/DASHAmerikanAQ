- &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Tonight on the season finale of <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>with the Kardashians.</i> &gt;&gt; RYAN SEACREST: It's 8:52 in the morning. All right, now let's get some real... real scoop. Did you date Joe Francis? Pete Wentz? Terrence Howard? And what's the story with Reggie Bush and Kim Kardashian? &gt;&gt; TRISH: Hey, Kim, it's Trish. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Trish. Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going to get to the bottom of this, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: We've already been through this. I don't want to go through this again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This time we went straight to the FBI. And that's who's coming over here now is the police, the FBI, and the attorney. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sheesh. &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; This is exciting. &gt;&gt; KIM: The <i>Dub</i> Show is a car show that I'm hosting for the day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; GEORGE: George. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: George? Being in the public eye is really cool. Thank you. People recognized me. That's a real trip. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not here to talk about my personal life. But there's one thing that drives me absolutely crazy about being famous. That's everyone wanting to know all the details about who I'm dating. &gt;&gt; You gotta meet Fabulous. &gt;&gt; KIM: One of the duties that the host fulfils at the <i>Dub</i> show is that I announce the performers. Bye. The next performer is the rapper Fabulous, who I've met one time before, yet the tabloids claimed I'm dating. So, I decided to have fun with it. So, this next performer is once rumored to be my boyfriend, so probably after I, you know, announce him today, we might get married. These crazy rumors... The tabloids just come up with these rumors-- people that I'm dating-- you know, what can you do? &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay, ladies, take care. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh... Hey, Cindals. &gt;&gt; CINDY: Hey, Kim, what's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Nothing. I'm just at the store with my sisters. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like what? So I get from my publicist Cindy, and it's her job to make sure that everything that the press writes about me is true. I saw him at Butter, and I literally, we were at completely separate tables. It's like across the other room, and we must have waved hi for one second. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I took a picture with him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney took a picture with him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They probably did. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've been really trying to not let these rumors get to me, but they're really getting out of hand. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Reading what this says on-line about... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you really reading this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What does it say? &gt;&gt; KIM: It says, "Bootylicious Kim Kardashian has a new man. The beauty has been out on the town with hunky actor Terrence Howard. They were all over each other. She was sitting on his lap, and he was rubbing her butt. The rapper Howard declined to comment." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at this. "Who is dating Kim Kardashian? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, let's see how many are true. One, two, three, four. Four out of ten are true. This is ridiculous. I want to go in here and write to them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, let me take care of this matter because I'm the professional. We are here for you. For <i>you,</i> Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I cannot believe they have this as if it's fact. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, this is stupid! &gt;&gt; KIM: It's stupid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why does Mom have a picture of you as her screen saver and not me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because Mom gets ten percent. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, get up, step away from the computer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Step away from the computer, please... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Step away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...before we escort you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney and Khloe are saying it's not a big deal, and all of our friends and family know it's not true, but the whole world thinks it's true. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get up... Up and out. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm already booked to appear on the <i>Ryan Seacrest</i> radio show, and I think this is the perfect opportunity for me to set the record straight. I'm so excited to go on <i>Ryan</i> <i>Seacrest</i> in the morning. I just feel like I can clear up all these rumors with all these guys that I've supposedly dated. He'll ask me funny questions, and I could finally give him the answers. I now realize I'm not a slorebag. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're not a slore, and you know it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know I'm totally the anti-slore. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, you're not a slore. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. &gt;&gt; ROB: Let's go make-pretend you are for the moment, though. Come on, slore. Come on, slore! &gt;&gt; SEACREST: ...Coast. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: On air. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Ryan Seacrest. 102.7. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; SEACREST: It's 8:52 in the morning. Seacrest with you. Coming into the studio now, we're bringing on sisters Kardashians. &gt;&gt; ELLEN: Yes. &gt;&gt; SEACREST: So, uh, Kim was listening earlier this morning, Ellen. &gt;&gt; ELLEN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SEACREST: And we were talking about your, your history of the social scene and circle. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to set the record straight. Let's be honest. Ask me everything. &gt;&gt; SEACREST: Okay, let me just run... This is gonna be very easy. Let me start with the list of guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Did you date Joe Francis from <i>Girls Gone Wild?</i> &gt;&gt; KIM: No way. That's my sister's friend. &gt;&gt; ELLEN: So Joe Francis: No way. &gt;&gt; SEACREST: Okay. What about the lead s... No, he's not the lead singer. Is he the bassist from Fall Out Boy, Pete Wentz? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, but I did kiss him. I was in his video, and we had a kissing scene, but I also kissed the monkey in that video, too. &gt;&gt; SEACREST: Strangely, I've kissed the monkey as well. Our friend, we talked to him not too long ago, Terrence Howard. I remember I walked in in the morning, and I saw... This is recently. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, this story is hysterical. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was sitting in his lap that night. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; SEACREST: It's 8:45. Kim Kardashian with us, and we're up to Reggie Bush. Now, are you dating him? What's the story with Reggie Bush and Kim Kardashian? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um... Reggie and I are good friends. &gt;&gt; SEACREST: First of all, a couple things. There was an "um," a pregnant pause, then you shifted eye contact. Have you ever seen Reggie Bush with his shirt off? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um... yes. He's... you know, aren't there lots of commercials and stuff with his shirt off? &gt;&gt; SEACREST: So then I'm going to put that as a yes. So, there is, there's definitely a potential there, though, 'cause you do think he's cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, you know, I'm trying to... I said to myself, I'm going to be single for a year. This is the only time in my life that I could focus on work. I have no time away from my family. If you date me, it's like you're dating my whole family. &gt;&gt; SEACREST: Oh, God, oh, God, you're dating Kris, too? &gt;&gt; ELLEN: The whole package. &gt;&gt; SEACREST: Well, thank you, girls, for coming. It's great to see all of you. I appreciate you getting up early. Thanks, girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye, you guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys, that went great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. And you did a great job. Are you done clearing up all the rumors? How do you feel about that? &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like the rumors, they can happen to everyone, and I get really sensitive about it when they're so not true, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you just have to toughen it up a little bit. Get a little bit tougher skin 'cause that's going to start happening all the time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rumors, shlumors. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; TRISH: Hey, Kim, this is Trish. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Trish. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? Wait, me and my sister together? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know where these pictures came from. Oh, my God. I thought I was already done with this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom! I need to talk to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's wrong? Honey, what's wrong? What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KIM: Those pictures of Kourtney... Oh, my God, there's Kourtney and Khloe. I cannot even face her. Mom, I don't want to talk to Kourtney. It was all my fault, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Listen, we're gonna get to the bottom of this, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: But I've already been through this. Then I have to face Bruce, and then I just, like, I don't want to go through this again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Please don't cry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Kim. I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did he ever tell you he was gonna sell them? This guy is going down. Okay, girls, the FBI is here. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's Kourtney. I'm responsible for ruining someone's life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you're not responsible for something that Kourtney did in high school. When Kourtney was in high school, she, unfortunately, took some pictures of her and her boyfriend together without any clothes on. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can handle this. It's just Kourtney... you know, I've been through this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you were 16 years old. &gt;&gt; KIM: But it was all my fault, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim stole Kourtney's pictures as a practical joke, but at some point, she lost them. We have to deal with the problem and not blame ourselves right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm the one that stole these from Kourtney and left them around for somebody else to get their hands on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll be right back. Can I get you anything? &gt;&gt; KIM: A gun. And I feel awful that because of me taking these from her, it's gonna ruin her life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khloe. Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come here. I need to talk to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Listen, I've got a problem. Kim's in the other room. She's really, really upset. Do you remember those pictures? They were taken when you guys were, like, in high school? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney's photos? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney's photos. They've resurfaced. And we've got a big, big problem because somebody was trying to sell the pictures to a magazine. So you need... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to keep Kourtney busy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's not gonna tell her? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's gonna tell her, but she's needs time to... it's very stressful in there. Go get her and keep her busy until I deal with Kim. As mad as I am at these girls, what I really need to do is get a grip and figure it out. &gt;&gt; Is there any indication that anyone was told when these photos were taken? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think people know. They were ten years ago. &gt;&gt; The pictures are obvious that Kourtney is underage. The fact that she's underage makes them illegal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Okay. Good point. This is a child pornography case. These kids are teenagers. They're in high school; they're underage; and anyone who would be selling or buying these photos, it's a federal offense. And then can we go after the guy who sold them? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: The last person that had access to these pictures that I know of was my ex-husband. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We really need to talk to Kim to figure out when we can go downtown to the buying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sunday, we were going to do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's go tell her and see if she's free on Sunday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, look, Baron's in here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Baron's in the mag. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want Kim to give you a heads-up that... how far this is going. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I call my ex-husband and he seems to have an idea of who could be causing this trouble: a friend that once stayed at his house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did he take these from your house? Did he ever tell you he was gonna sell them? No, he wouldn't tell you that. Okay. This guy is going down. The one thing I know we have to do is listen to the people that are trying to help us and not try to take control of the whole situation myself. This is a case for the FBI. &gt;&gt; I just got off the phone with Special Agent Bernie He is FBI. They'd like to arrange a meeting with you as soon as possible and they can come out to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If they could come here, that would be great. &gt;&gt; KIM: So do you think that any pictures are gonna get out by tomorrow? &gt;&gt; I can't answer that one for you because we don't know exactly what this guy's done. We know that he's e-mailed a couple of the photos. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Angelina has great boobs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right. See ya. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want to talk to anyone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who is it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kourt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really, what's going on with everyone? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just give us a minute, okay? We'll be right out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys are, like, hiding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, we're not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, bizarre. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're busy, Kourtney. The two of us can hardly bear the thought of telling Kourtney what's going on. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't know how I'm gonna tell Kourtney. She's gonna kill me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We know we have to, because the FBI is on the way. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I should just talk to Kourtney and get it over with. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney... we have something that we need to share with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Guess what's come back to haunt us? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My sex pictures? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In a weird way, I was kind of prepared for this because these pictures have always been haunting me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I got a call from someone saying that an agency is trying to shop them around. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: These pictures were a private thing that I took with my boyfriend a long time ago, and I never thought that anyone would see them. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't care what they say about me, you know what I mean, but if they say it about you and then it's, like... Kourtney is so non-emotional, but I know she's probably really worried and really scared. But then again, we've gone through this before. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think what happened with Kim the first time around was really, really a disaster. And I think that even though she won her lawsuit, she took that on herself without any of us, and then once we all got involved, the whole thing turned around. This time, we went straight to the FBI. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And that's who's coming over here now, is the police, the FBI and the attorney. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Get out of my room. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Get out of my room. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Get out of my room. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Stop, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, it's... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ow! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, God, Kendall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mommy said the FBI was coming; that's why I couldn't get in my room. I think Kimmie's crying. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kim's crying? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I think. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want you to feel bad and feel like it's your fault about this. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is my fault. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but, we were young... I mean, I took the pictures, so... it's my fault. Everyone has sex with their boyfriend. Everyone takes pictures. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not everyone takes pictures. Okay, girls, the FBI is here. Look your best. Two special agents from the FBI show up; they tell us they want to interview each one of us individually and in a separate place. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's kind of scary 'cause they're, you know, one's talking and one's writing down everything you say, and I want to do it fast so they can hurry up and get out of there and go find this guy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: As if the FBI interviewing my daughters isn't scary enough, I still need to tell Bruce what's going on. I'll talk to Bruce. You go in and get them something to eat. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Talk to me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's been a little situation. Um, Kourtney's in, uh, the office right now with, um, the FBI. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, really? Years ago, I did that <i>TV's</i> <i>Bloopers and Practical Jokes...</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not a blooper or practical joke. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...and they had the IRS was after me. It's not something like that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. I swear to God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce knows about the pictures from the past. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's going on now? &gt;&gt; KIM: For once, it has nothing to do with me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I'm hoping that he'll be understanding. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When you're young and stupid, you make mistakes. But in today's society, those mistakes stay with you for the rest of your life. One guys posts one of those shots online, and it's there for life. Your grandkids will be looking at it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. I'm calling Scott to see if he's coming here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Does he know all about this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nope. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I hate telling people things because I get really nervous and smile and laugh, and I don't want Scott to think that this is a joke because it is really serious. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know how I have sex pictures when I was 17? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: With Jeff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Someone's trying to, like, sell them to everyone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And that was before your boob job, is that why you're mad? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? I don't know if you're serious! These dudes are FBI? They're not wearing very nice suits. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you know what? This is not a joke. This is not a joke. I found that out, it's not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. This is not a joke. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The last thing I want to see is my girlfriend on somebody else, nor do I want the world to. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you with somebody in these? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just Jeff in one picture, one with him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I'm getting, like, a mental picture. I don't want to think about it. That's disgusting. I'm going to the bathroom to throw up. You're saying because you were 17, it's not a big deal. Like, if you were now you did it, it wouldn't be bad? I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How do you feel about yourself? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel fine about myself. I was 17 and took pictures with my boyfriend. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're saying 'cause you were 17 it's not a big deal? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's a big deal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But why do you keep mentioning the age? I don't understand. Like, if you were now you did it, it wouldn't be bad? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just saying, you do things when you're young that you don't always think about. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, doll, I'm so sure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know... You know that, whatever... I'm not even a thing would ever happen to our relationship, just for the record. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I totally get where Scott's coming from, it's just really comforting, though, to know that he's supporting me no matter what. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just, everyone, please say your prayers tonight when we go to bed. Like, I'm so drained. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I want to do is crawl into bed and watch <i>The</i> <i>Bachelor.</i> &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think we're all tired. Good night, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good night. I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you no matter what. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing, Ken? How's it going? When our family has this sort of drama, it's hardest on the little ones. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why was the FBI here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The FBI. The FBI was here because those are the people that you call when you have a really big-time grown-up problem. And they come to help. I'll tell you more about it when you're grown up, okay? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. I love you, honey. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love you, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, let's get to bed, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? Okay. Okay. They got the guy. The FBI went in the middle of the night. They have everyone that they e-mailed that they solicited to. They have all the responses, and they have the source of where the pictures originally came from. &gt;&gt; KIM: There are no pictures on the Internet, and the FBI caught the person that was selling the photos. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so relieved. I kept waking up at, like, 4:00 in the morning and then, like, going on TMZ. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. Me, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And seeing if... Are there pictures? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm in the best mood, everyone! No pictures! Whoo! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think we've all learned a very valuable lesson. Don't trust anybody. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to be known to not be messed with. I want to just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not going to mess with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, seriously. I won my lawsuit. Now the FBI got this right away. I want people to know the Kardashians cannot bewith. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Damn, little whoaty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No pun intended. &gt;&gt; KIM: Fame has its advantages, and it definitely has its disadvantages, and whatever we do reflects on my family. So now I know, I have to get it right. Girls... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Can you come out here? I want to talk to you guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know that you guys sometimes don't understand what goes on, and I'm sorry if, you know, at school, maybe your friends have said things to you or... come to you with things that maybe you don't know the whole truth about, but you have three big sisters that you can always come to, and when you get to that point and you do like boys, I want you to be able to call me and tell me whatever you want to. And you, too, okay? I love you so much. Get over here. When it really comes down to it, the most important thing in life is family. Oh, my little darling. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This has been quite a year for our family. All the skeletons are out of the closet... I hope. But overall, I think we're a lot closer. &gt;&gt; KIM: Family hugs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Family hugs. We love each other a lot and we have each other's back, for sure. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, let me get in! &gt;&gt; KIM: There's nothing like family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can I get in? &gt;&gt; KIM: Especially those crazy Kardashians. Oh, wait, I'm getting suffocated. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim doesn't like that much affection. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Unless it's from a male. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, get off of me, seriously. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Serious. Off!
