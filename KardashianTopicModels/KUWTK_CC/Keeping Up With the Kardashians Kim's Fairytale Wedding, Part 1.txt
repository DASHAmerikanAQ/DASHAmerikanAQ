- Kim's Fairy Tale Wedding... &gt;&gt; I think I'm going to change my last name to Humphries. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are incorporated. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are so selfish. I'm not just going to go and live in your place in Minnesota. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm not. If all of you are talking , there's no reason why any of you should be at my wedding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, what, you don't want me at your wedding? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I don't. I'm forgetting what all of this is supposed to be about. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The wedding is finally here! 13 00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,378 &gt;&gt; KIM: This is more than I ever could've dreamed of. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Baby, every girl dreams about being married. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, one time... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: To someone like me. And your dream came true. &gt;&gt; KIM: This year has been such an amazing surprise. From the moment I spotted Kris, he was everything that I ever wanted and more. I love you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I love you, too. What made me realize Kim's the one I want to marry is just that I look at her and I see the mother of my children. Will you marry me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, yes. Kris always makes me laugh. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I can't wait to have a wonderful family with a bunch of kids. &gt;&gt; KIM: How many? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Two kids. &gt;&gt; KIM: Three. Four. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, two. &gt;&gt; KIM: Four. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: One. &gt;&gt; KIM: Four. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: One. &gt;&gt; KIM: Boom. I think Kris and I are a really good match. Like, we're so opposite. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm excited to be a part of this family now. Despite all the drama and craziness, they genuinely really care about each other. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've actually got a keeper. You picked a good one. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I think we've really changed each other's lives. And I'm really excited and 42 00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,584 looking forward to this amazing journey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can we skip? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim? Kim?! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're not here to wait on you, princessa. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, you guys. So I asked you to come over because... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, God. You're pregnant! &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Another baby out of wedlock. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I decided... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sorry, it's just you, kid; just you. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...that I want to get married this summer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this really happening? Are you really getting married this summer? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. Yes. Kris and I have decided that we're going to get married this summer. And we are so excited. 'Cause, like, if we want to start having kids right away... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why do you want to have kids right away? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, you got to slow it down, woman. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm 30 years old. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you really want these to get much bigger? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I don't, but I want to have kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where should it be? What are you going to wear? Who's going to do your makeup? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have always pictured my wedding to be romantic and soft and just filled with love. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like you're very Disneyland, like a Cinderella story. Like, very themey of, like, Cinderella. &gt;&gt; KIM: Theme? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I'm not saying go invite Mickey Mouse to the wedding. I'm just saying, I feel like it's, like, a castle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. Here's a Mickey Mouse wedding. Look. They have the castle in the background, and they have Mickey and Minnie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want, like, the most glamorous wedding you've ever imagined. I need help with every last thing. So if you have any suggestions on location, anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who are your bridesmaids? You two. Kendall, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kayla. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's Kayla? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris's sister. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. Who's his groomsmen? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think he'll have Rob. His spray tanner came over today, and he goes, "I had to spray-tan abs on your brother." He wanted, like, fake abs painted on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then asked to 89 00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,926 borrow money to pay for it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES : It's me, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, babe. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES : Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris has been out of town. Now that he's back, I feel like we can just get right into it and start planning the wedding. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Baby, I brought you a surprise. Hey, Gizzie, look! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES : Look. &gt;&gt; KIM: You brought the dog. I love dogs, I love pets, but, like, from afar. We can leave him in there for a little bit. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES : Want to get in get to know your place. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm definitely very happy that Kris is here, but to live together changes everything. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES : Oh, he's taking a boo-boo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You want to grab a napkin or something, go pick that up? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, no, but you can. I'm so you excited you're here. I feel like we have so much to talk about for the wedding. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm excited. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here, while you're at it, I see one over here from the other dog. Ew. Kris loves his dogs, which makes me think that he would be, like, really good with kids. And he's just, like, a good person. But there is dog poop all outside. Oh, my God. It stinks. I'm such a neat freak that I don't even know how I'm gonna live with him, let alone two dogs. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Baby, I'm so excited to be here! &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe, you just picked up 121 00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,546 dog poop. Ew, wash your hands! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Whoo! Whoo! &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's go tell my mom that we're getting married this summer. Hello, lady. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We're getting married this summer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, that's what we wanted to tell you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What, is this a joke? If you tell me you're going to get married in nine days, I'll literally lose my &gt;&gt; KIM: No, we're thinking about 90. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 90 days? Kim has had a pretty good idea of what she wanted for her wedding since she was a little girl. It's all about everything being way over the top and spectacular. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you could do Khloe's wedding in nine days, don't give me any hassle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's going to be a whole different thing than Khloe's wedding. And I'm not ready for this right now. When do you go to training camp? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: End of September. No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Technically, he's not even signed to a deal. So who knows if he's even gonna be in New York. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait a minute. Do you have a job? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Right now, I do not have a job. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just have one little question. What made you guys put this on the fast track? What happened to waiting a year? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Um, she's in her prime right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: And she wants to get married soon. Those pictures are forever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You want to get married so she looks good in photos? 152 00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,968 &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, she does, not me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is it that you always have to be in that exact same spot in my bathroom? We have 17 televisions in this house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But every time I go in the other TV room, you know, you yell at me and stuff. I can come in here and be nice and quiet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is my place, really nice and quiet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's bugging you, honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's bugging me is my face. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's like I have jowls. If this was just-- Like, this needs to go. Look, look, look. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know it does. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have been talking about having my face done for the last five years. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, there's no rush. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No rush? There's a wedding that's going to happen fast and furious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim's wedding is the biggest event I have ever planned in my entire life. So I only got a couple months to get my neck done. Right now, time is not on my side. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just quit obsessing on yourself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I won't! I will not quit obsessing on myself. No, no! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Listen to me. You would say putting a wedding on is stressful. How about business? Stressful? Okay, now you're going to throw facelift, getting knocked out. Little stressful? Why do this all at the same time? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Actually, getting knocked out right now sounds like a gift from heaven. I'm the person who never wanted to be put to sleep. Right now, that would be heaven. BRUCE: You know what? It sounds pretty good. I think they should put you to 186 00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,584 sleep for a couple hours. I'll get a little peace. Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, I made that sandwich for Kendall. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was in there. There was nobody on it. Hey, hey, hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nobody on it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't even think about it, bud. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, guys, so I kind of called this meeting 'cause I know that we have, like, lots of dates and everything seems, like, really hectic. It's really time to get everyone together. There's so many details that have to be worked out for the wedding. And we don't have a whole lot of time. Mom is going into surgery, so she won't really be able to... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to be down for the count. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Killer boots, man! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does that mean that you're not going to be our manager for... &gt;&gt; KRIS: For, like, 48 hours. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Can I have a glass of champagne? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want champagne, too? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Do you need me here for this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can we get back to the subject? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Can we get some champagne out here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I drank-- I'm drinking it for us all, honey. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This isn't about you, Khloe, so zip it up. Lock it up. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all, you can get your lazy ass up and go get your ownglass of champagne. I don't know Kris Humphries. I haven't bonded with him. He typically isn't someone that I would gravitate to. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I just wanted to have a cheers with you, and now you're alienating me. How dare you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are very intense out here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know what, Kris? I like you so much I want to go get you a glass of champagne. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go get it, Kourt. You go do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I'm going to pour it right on your head, okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go piss in that glass, Kourt. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can we kind of stick on subject and let Kim talk? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just kind of want to, like, get on track and see what the dates of everything are. I'm thinking we need, like, a week before to set up and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would watch out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Frankie, cheers. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you know why I call you Frankie? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because you remind me of a glimpse of Frankenstein. You just need bullets-- little bolts right here. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't know if we should give Lamar a plus one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have no say. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What you're going to learn really fast in this family is the men have no say-so whatsoever. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're absolutely wrong. I will burn this place to the ground. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look how we calmed Scott down. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I used to talk just like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Youris gonna be gone the day you get married. This is how this family works. Drink up, Chuck. It's going to be a long night. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe says anything and everything to try and get under your skin a little bit. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I can't even handle Khloe anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like you guys hate each other. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: She's... Oh, man. &gt;&gt; KIM: What, you can't take a little heat? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Don't let her in if it's Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. I'm kind of laughing it off, but I don't want either one of them to get too sensitive. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Can I ask you a question on-camera? Do you think you're invited to our wedding? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm in your wedding. Thanks. That was very enlightening. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Do you think you're invited to the wedding?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There ain't gonna be a wedding, baby. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I eat pieces of like you guys for breakfast. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I say something? And I'm not trying to, like, put anyone on the spot here. But I feel like you guys are being kind of mean to Kris. And he's new to the family and doesn't really get how you guys play around. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: You, you and you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I only hate one person; I love everyone else. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not going to let him talk to me a certain way and then me not stand up for myself. He's going back and forth. I don't know what it is about Kris, but I feel like every time he's around me, he just wants to start digging in at me. I would think by now he knows I'm going to throw it right back at you. And, honey, I'm a dirty fighter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How do you run late to go register for your wedding? &gt;&gt; KIM: Where theare you? You're pissing a lot of people off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We all don't feel like Kris makes an effort to know us. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm trying to ease 277 00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,921 tension with Khloe and bam. I know when you're talking bad &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shall we have a seat, guv'nor? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure. Well... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is a little bit annoying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just a tad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You'd just think he would want to be... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Giving a better impression. Not trying to fight with us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, but I also feel like I just cannot forget about like the stuff that Kris said to me he first time I ever met him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What did he say? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where he said, "So are you really married? And so then Kim was like, "He's just kidding." I was like, "Joking or not, that's not funny to me." And I, like, don't mean to be rude, but it's just like I don't know what his intentions are. Like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know what his intentions are either, and I really don't care. Like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We can only... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wish I didn't care. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...say so much to Kim. Like if we said to Kim, "Kim, he has bad intentions." So that-- she's not going to listen to us. 300 00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,480 So what are you going to do, dude? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have the wedding dress sketches. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you don't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. You're gonna die. So when the news broke that we were engaged, a lot of wedding gown designers sent us over sketches right away. So here are the Vera Wang sketches. That one I loved because I thought that was really modern. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's so you right there. &gt;&gt; KIM: And this one is cool, but I think my boobs will pop out of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. That's beautiful. So then Zack Posen sent his sketch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Then this is Marchesa. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Look at this. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you so excited? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited. But now I'm stressed because I have so many options that I can't choose. This is something that I think every girl has dreamed of. But it's so hard to choose. There's so many gorgeous dresses. It's so hard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so hard, right? 323 00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,253 &gt;&gt; KIM: But I just love them all. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is so gross. Oh, don't. I bet you didn't know I wore retainers. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Oh, wow. All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Could I tell you what another one of my pet peeves is? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Someone that brushes their teeth so hard that they make the entire mirror... &gt;&gt; KIM: ...all... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Was that me? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. That was the alien that came in. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Ah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, that is my side, but I'll give it to you. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Come on, boys. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. They cannot sleep in my bed. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris, they're not allowed in my bed. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Just watch. They'll chill right here. &gt;&gt; KIM: And that's silk right there. I will not whatsoever tolerate dogs sleeping in my bed. No matter how cute. It's just not sanitary enough to sleep in the sheets with us under the covers. Brodie, get down. It can't come near. Kris? Kris?! We'll definitely have to address 349 00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,993 this dog issue tomorrow. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Good night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: Good morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm kind of nervous, you guys. &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: You are? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: It's normal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It is? &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: It's also exciting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm at Garth Fisher's office for my pre-surgery consultation, and it's not something I ever thought I would do. And I've got to admit, I am terrified. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Turn and face this corner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've always been really self-conscious about my neck and my chin and my body. Do you think I look fat? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. You look fine. Let's go. Will you lay out with me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Lay out... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to lay out with my bathing suit? I feel too uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KIM: No one will see us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that I'm ready, but I'm not sure that I can handle the stress right before this wedding. So if you had a big event, to go to... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...like a really big event... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...how much time would you give yourself? Like... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I would give it at least three months to feel really, really good. Your body's using all its energy to heal the face. Yeah, I don't think I have three months. But I probably can give it a good month. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: A good month, you'll be okay to recover. You have to really relax, talk calmly, no yelling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Talking calmly? So none of my girls can upset me? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: No. They have to be... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nobody can raise their voice? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: No, They have to be super sweet to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why didn't I have this 385 00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,612 surgery years ago? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Years ago. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm just trying to pull his eye boogers out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew. These are not the types of problems I want to deal with. Like, that's just unsanitary to have a dog on the kitchen counter when I'm... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You don't cook anyways. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...making breakfast. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You don't cook. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I do. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Things are so good, that you're just trying to make up something. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have allergies now that your dogs are here. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, you don't. &gt;&gt; KIM: I never sneezed this much, I swear on my life. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Every time I come to L.A. they will be here. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I'll deal, but they will not sleep in the bed. Like, no, they're going to be in a little crate. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim wants to put my dogs in crates. Like, come on. She's used to being on her on and having things her way, and it's a part of marriage. We need to compromise. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want them in my my bed. They're not going to be in my bed. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's what it's going to be. &gt;&gt; KIM: Then I'm going to a hotel. I'm not going to sleep in the bed with them. Actually, you should go to a hotel with the dogs. 412 00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,872 &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Too late. You already said you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm meeting my mom, and we are meeting Kris for our gift registry. Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is really becoming, like, real. Like, were making our home together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kris? &gt;&gt; KIM: He is late. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is he a late guy? Does he always run late? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, apparently, I guess. I don't know. The fact that Kris is late is just disrespectful to my mom, disrespectful to me. And it just shows that, you know, he doesn't really care to help out with the wedding planning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want Dad? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, seriously, where theare you? You're late. My mom has her thing tomorrow. She doesn't have time, and she cancelled another appointment to come and meet us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe Kris is late the day that they're going to register for their wedding gifts. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you're told to be somewhere at a certain time, what makes you think that you can be late? 434 00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:25,237 You're pissing a lot of people off. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You're about to be put put under. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you're going to be fine. Don't cry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm scared. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's Kim's engagement party at my house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want me to pour this glass of wine on your head? 442 00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,053 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For two minutes, be nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's get back in the mode. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so mad at him right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you've gotta get out of the mad place and into the fun place. And decide what kind of china you would like to sit down to at the end of the day. &gt;&gt; KIM: I like simple. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm sorry, baby. Sorry, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's okay. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Sorry. I was ready before you, though. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can tell my mom was pretty irritated with Kris. I mean, the one thing that she freaks out about is time. Just, like, so you know, my mom, she was waiting here for, like, 30 to 45 minutes before us and always... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Let's keep in mind I was going to be here 15 minutes before you. And I went to eat because you were still at home when I called you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but I was counting on you being here on time. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: So just-- we've gotta do better on time. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We'll do better. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause she finds that really disrespectful. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I will. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, look, here's your red and your black. Is this Hermes? &gt;&gt; SALESPERSON: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I love this just 'cause it has the "H." &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I love that your favorite things is Hermes. And your new last name's going to start with an "H." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not for long, if you're late all the time. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, look. How cool is this white with the monkeys? &gt;&gt; SALESPERSON: Don't you love that? That's fun. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You think I look like a monkey? I'm offended. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you like this one, Kris? &gt;&gt; SALESPERSON: This one's really pretty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, that's pretty. &gt;&gt; SALESPERSON: Yeah, look at at that. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, I don't like that; that just looks cheap. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kris is late, and then he has the nerve to really criticize my taste and Kim's taste. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I would feel weird putting this in my mouth. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Have you ever eaten with something that looks like this? &gt;&gt; SALESPERSON: Look, Kim, over here for a minute. Those are amazing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't really like those for drinking out of. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I could use a drink right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What is that? &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean what is this? This is the dog crates and the dog beds. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Um... &gt;&gt; KIM: Anything we could possibly need... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: They don't need these. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...for mutts. Yeah, they do. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Return these. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Honestly, I can't believe you bought these cages. They're not going to sleep in these. They can't sleep on the foot of the bed? &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. If you don't want to sleep with just me in the bed, then we have a problem. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right, I'm not going to freak out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at how much the dog likes it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Listen, we'll put these on the bed, on the foot of the bed, and they'll sleep in them. That's a great compromise. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't even want them sitting on my comforter. I don't sit on my comforter. He loves it in there. He's trying to go down. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: They will not sleep in there. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't want the dogs in the bed. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You just want to fight me on everything. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I don't. It's... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: At some point, you need to just let go and live life. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it that hard to comprehend that I'm a neat freak? 515 00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,227 &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't know what to tell you. &gt;&gt; MAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Today is the day of my surgery. I'm anxious and scared and nervous all at the same time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, why are you crying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce has gone to Vegas to give a speech, which was probably a terrible idea of me to book him for that. But Pastor Brad's here to calm my nerves and say some prayers. &gt;&gt; BRAD: In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Amen. 527 00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:11,230 And Khloe and Rob are going to drive me to the doctors. Do you think I should have taken a Xanax or something to calm my nerves? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not allowed to take drugs. You're about to be put under. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, Robert. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah? I Survived, that TV show. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And it's the saddest show I've ever seen. This one girl was 13 years old. This guy grabbed her and took her. Then finally said, "I have to kill you now." The guy shot her 27 times, and she still lived. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you telling me this horrendous story on my way to be put to sleep and have surgery? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is what... &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is the most disgusting thing... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but that's what... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...that anyone has ever done to me. &gt;&gt; ROB: 27 times? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop. Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But that's what... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now I have to get this whole thing out of my head. Oh, my God. What is wrong with you people? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert. &gt;&gt; ROB: What? That's the men's room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you see if someone's in there? I have to pee. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? Hello? &gt;&gt; ROB: You don't sit in public bathrooms? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you can't ever sit in a public bathroom, you freak. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, get out of here. We are so going to get in trouble. This is stressing me out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't touch any of the silver. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to be really calm today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob and I like to do everything together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Use all the right bathrooms and say all the right things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's right here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, you guys are all cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? I've never had such a stressful morning, honestly, in my entire life. Nobody's being soothing. They've told me every horror story that they've ever watched on television. &gt;&gt; ROB: A girl got shot 27 times and survived. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. This is so wrong on another level. I'm feeling a little scared and anxious, and my children seem a little preoccupied with their own lives. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't cry. Mom, you're going to be fine. Why are you crying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just really scared. &gt;&gt; KIM: But, Mom, don't be scared. It's going to be fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it, like, safe to be under that long? I'm kind of worried. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I know when you're talking bad about me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is very opportunistic of you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: How dare you question someone else's marriage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm scared. &gt;&gt; KIM: But, Mom, don't be scared. It's going to be fine. I'm sure people are scared all the time. You know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't lay on me, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're squishing me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, Rob and I are just trying to lighten the mood. My mom is a little overdramatic. She just shouldn't worry about it. She's in great hands. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you're going to wake up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I'm going to wake up. I just think it's going to be difficult. Right now, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. I'm going to be going through a traumatic experience. It's a big deal for my body. And it's a big deal emotionally. There's Auntie. &gt;&gt; SHELLI: Party for the facelift! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You want to go in with me? Like a miracle, my girlfriends arrive. &gt;&gt; SHEILA: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! These are my best friends. Oh, Lisa! &gt;&gt; JOYCE: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And they're showing me a lot of love. I have all my besties here. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: We're all going to go now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Don't touch the red line on your left. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where do I go? &gt;&gt; MAN: Right in here. We're going to go into the bathroom to change. &gt;&gt; FISHER: All right. Ready to go? Scoot off to the side here just a little bit. Put your chin down. Like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think my mom is so petrified to go into surgery. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So this... this will kick in pretty quick-- maybe, you know, 20, 30 seconds. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think she's afraid that she won't wake up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you, Mom. 615 00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:57,689 &gt;&gt; FISHER: See y'all later. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: She's asleep. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? My sisters and I are at our photo shoot for the cover of magazine at the same time my mom is in the middle of her surgery. Are you watching me curl my lashes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is so freakish. I would never do that to myself. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you think Liz Taylor would? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, well, duh, 'cause she is "dimone" friendly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What does "dimone" friendly mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Diamond friendly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim always has had an infatuation with Elizabeth Taylor. She's known for just dripping in diamonds-- very Zsa Zsa, glamorous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So Elizabeth Taylor had three kids with one husband, and then she got married. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She was married like eight times, and she got married to the same guy twice. Well, Kim's new name is Lizzie. She'll think it's about diamonds. But it's about the men, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think Kourtney and Khloe are taking any of this seriously. I think that they just don't want to think about anything at all having to do with the surgery. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Nice. Right there, got it. That's it. Good. Nice. 643 00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:32,651 Look at me. Right here, guys. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Right here. Looking good. Nice. Good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Constantly, I'm thinking 648 00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:52,070 about my mom this whole day. I'm a little scared for her. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have been busy all day long. My mom is in her surgery, and I'm just really anxious. I'm kind of worried. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom's, um, surgery is taking a little bit longer than I thought. It's like... it was supposed to be like six hours, and it's taking like nine or ten. The thing I think about is just, like, is everything okay? Like, why is it taking longer? Like, what happened? Did something go wrong? And I keep trying to check up with the doctor. This is Kim, Kris's daughter. I was just calling to actually check on my mom and see how... how it's going. 662 00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:40,652 Is it, like, safe to be under that long? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am worried about Kris Humphries. I do not know where his intensions lie. Have you had any STDs before? Talk to us. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm not in this family yet, so, like... like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's real quick to get out. &gt;&gt; KIM: I finally got the call that my mom is out of surgery, but I'm just really curious and anxious to see why it took so long. &gt;&gt; FISHER: Hello. How are you guys? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; FISHER: This is Dr. Akkaway, the anesthesiologist. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; AKKAWAY: Nice to see you again. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good to see you. Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; FISHER: How are you? Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: So have you guys worked, like, all... is this, like, the... one of the longest for you? &gt;&gt; FISHER: No, her surgery went absolutely perfect. Her neck, uh, looks beautiful. Her jaw line. I mean, everything's very natural, very conservative. She's all good. &gt;&gt; KIM: When Dr. Fisher tells me that the surgery went perfect, it just makes me feel really good. Hi, gorgeous. &gt;&gt; SHELLI: She's, like, totally out of it. &gt;&gt; KIM: She looks gorgeous. &gt;&gt; SHELLI: Are you coming back to the world? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're going to be so happy. Now we're really twins. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mmm. &gt;&gt; SHELLI: She's going to have to grow her hair long, though. &gt;&gt; KIM: Or I'll have to cut my hair short. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mmm. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, we're going to move you to a different bed, and we're going to go to the hotel right now. If it were me and I was having surgery, I would hate to wake up and not have anyone familiar there, so right away, I'm like, "I'm going to spend the night." We're here, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, do you have any Binaca? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do I have any Binaca? Um... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's in my little red bag in my suitcase. I just don't want to have bad breath. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't have bad breath-- I promise. No one could even smell your breath. No one's here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want me to take a picture of you and show it to you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. So that is, like, the little drain. That's it. Like, the drain. And then... no bruising. It looks gorgeous. You literally look like you're my age. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, good night. I love you. Um, so I'm going to just be right here, okay? 717 00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,675 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo? Doesn't this look like Kendall? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, maybe. We don't have pictures of us, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, we legitimately don't have one picture of me and you in our house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We don't have pictures of anyone in our house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We have a picture of Kim and Kris. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, that needs to go away. It's not supposed to be there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Totally, I'm going to throw that out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, guys! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shake your Oh, yeah, they jiggle, baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who is this? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who... who's me? This is not your house. Who is this? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Your brother. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, your brother. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, your brother-in-law. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's... oh, it's Scott. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott is here. Is this Kris Humphries? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES:you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, don't be a &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, that's a little... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hello. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, party! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What's up, girl? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, only high fives over here, boy. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, seriously, I just got back from the hospital. None of you guys have gone to see Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think Mom looks any different? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You know what the neck looks like? the guy, when he gets his body taken over by an alien and it's like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, did you just say my mom looks like an alien? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, I did not say that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What did you just say? Men in Black? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, I said that after the surgery the neck is, like, so tight that it's like... You should do some sort of Khloe Botox line, or some sort of... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't do the 'tox. This, money can't buy, honey. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's why you're wearing your hair like this today. Maybe there's a spot or something? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm putting my hair out of my face because I have no problems with my face. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whenever Khloe and Kris are together, it just always has to be something-- always. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris, how many girlfriends have you had in your life? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Um... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Speak into here. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: None that I remember. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good answer! Good answer! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you had any STDs before? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I really don't know Khloe that well, but she's, uh, going hard on me. She just asks a lot of uncomfortable questions. That's just who she is. Khloe's just kind of an inappropriate attention seeker. I'm not going to answer questions like this. You're disgusting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? I need to know before Kim has sex with you. I know you guys haven't had sex yet. It's not the wedding night. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Well, listen, it's already too late. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You had premarital sex?! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, that's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney's still making me wait. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought that's why you guys were waiting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Immaculate conception. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm not answering any questions. They're disgusting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am worried about Kris Humphries. I do not know where his intentions lie. He sees Kim, who is this beautiful trophy wife, who has a ton of money, works her ass off, great personality. Like, Kim has so many amazing things. And Kris has nothing to lose if marries Kim, and he gets a divorce. He has everything to gain. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're just so creepy to be around. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why am I creepy to be around? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: 'Cause you say uncomfortable things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I say the same things I do now that I any other time. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, you're not as gross. You guys, I'm not in this family yet, so, like, if you're going to talk about nastiness, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's real quick to get out. It doesn't take too long. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Listen, uh, hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're an aggressive driver. You should slow down, by the way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: By the way, don't ever drive in this lane the right. That's the... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bikers'? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...biker lane. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why would you drive in that little lane? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I just didn't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You literally were all the way over? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I was driving in both lanes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ay-yi-yi. I feel like you guys need to take it easy on Kris. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's out here by himself, just like I was, for a lot of years. And it's not easy to have all of you going after, you know? And he's doing whatever he can to, you know, be a part of the family, and everybody is just, you know... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're just joking. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...interrogating him &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: and asking him questions. I mean, he has to learn. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...getting after him. No, but I know how that feels, you don't. I think Khloe and Kourtney are definitely being a little hard on Humphries. I mean, I've been there. I know how hard it is and how uncomfortable it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are disgusting, and you're going way too overboard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think he's ready for a monogamous relationship? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe, she's pregnant! Can you just keep your hands off of her? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't touch her! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think everybody will be pretty sorry if they pushed him so far that he walked away from from Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want him to feel uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want him to feel, you know, like part of the family, but that takes a while. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just getting settled, and it's been years. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You also did things, too. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What did I do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Piss everyone off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, suck me dry, beautiful. Everybody makes mistakes. 842 00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:32,190 You guys are like the terror squad. Are your lights on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nope. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How are you doing? &gt;&gt; NURSE: Good. And you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. The speech is done. I drive all the way home, and boom, where do I go? Directly to see how my wife is and see how she's doing. No, can't be her room. You can't be watching football. You're not watching ESPN football, are you, my little Christmas tree? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't look like a Christmas tree. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got these little Christmas ornaments all over your head, little balls. Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. How'd you make it through the night? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: After this, are you going to trade me in for a younger guy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, duh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Duh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're having an engagement party tonight. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. We're partying tonight while you're in here. Everybody's going to be there. I'll just lay here and eat my applesauce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Since you're watching ESPN, I guess I can just sit here and watch it with you, huh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't play with my stuff. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, um, this little black thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't. No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, it's hooked around the... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, no! Don't move the bed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could you go find your own bed to lay in? I mean, I have one shot at being alone for a couple of days, and you're, like, laying on top of me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So what are you trying to tell me? You want me to go hit some golf balls? I got my golf shoes on. I'm ready to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's not even normal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hmm. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's about as pretty as it can get, right? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Scottie boy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, the hell are you, Humph-cake? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I had to pick up a, uh, polo cause I didn't really have any golf gear. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, dude. So you're, so you're telling me because you don't have a polo shirt, I have to sit out in the heat for an hour? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I apologize. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, you don't need to apologize. Just get here so we can hang out already. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. Who doesn't have a polo shirt? Only somebody from, like, Lake Minnetonka. Before Humphries gets here... &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...I feel like, you know, we need to give him some advice about sticking his foot right in his mouth with these girls. You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The reason I come out here is to get away from all that crap. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right, but you know, you can't today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know, honestly. He's really controlling. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can't be that in this family. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I'm saying. You know, I had to make quite a bit of changes to get along with everybody in the whole Kardashian clan. And, you know, one, wasn't cheap. I actually had to surgically remove my penis. So I have a lot of advice for Kris: first and foremost, shut your mouth. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, there he is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yo, sorry guys. I got lost again. You don't respect time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why are you an hour late? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I had to pick up a polo. I don't even have golf shoes. My pants look stupid. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't really care, like, if you're on time or not. But these women, though, when you're late, really, like, that's, like, the end of the world to them. And I know you don't care 'cause you're set in your stone. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, putting down the law. But it may bite you in your ass in the end. That's all I'm saying. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You've seen everything I'm doing. You're like the guy, "Oh, he's gonna go through this in a second." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just watching. All I'm saying is I had a, like, I had a talk with Kourtney the other day. And I was, like, "Dude, it seems like Kris is going through, literally, exactly what I went through, and it sucks." I'm saying if you want to get past it, take it easy with the loose lip, talkingto everybody. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Dude, come on. Look, at the end of the day, there is nocompromise. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, God, yeah, right. Take it easy. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Scott's trying to give me a warning on how to act around these women. I can't be warned. You know, I appreciate his comments in trying to help me out, but at the end of the day, I can't be in this family if I can't be me. Happy Gilmore. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: God! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you show him? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Show me something. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's all in the hips. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Show me this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just get in there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's like the blind leading the blind. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's all right here, here, baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You gotta... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's all right here. See that? &gt;&gt; ROB: All in the hips. All in the hips. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's it right there. There you go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's the money right there. Whoa, look at that. He's back on. This guy's a fast learner, huh? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim and Kris, we wish you nothing but the best till death do you part. Death till you part. &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, we just... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Enough. I know when you're &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Make sure you're looking out for banks. &gt;&gt; JOSH: Any bank? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Like, a major bank. Josh is one of my best friends. friends. He's one of the people that I go to when I'm frustrated about something 'cause he can give it to me straight. So I don't know. I'm-I'm kind of having issues with some of the family. I mean, it's not nothing major. It's just, like, I'm a very say-what-I-want-to-say- type person, you know that. &gt;&gt; JOSH: And so are they. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: And so are they. &gt;&gt; JOSH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: So it's, like, with Khloe, it feels like if I joke around, I'll say something that's, you know, here. She'll take it to there. I'll take it to there. Then by the time were up here, it'll turn into, like, some real tension. And Kim's thinking, "Oh, my God, I don't want Khloe to hate Kris. I don' want Kris to hate Khloe." She just wants it to be perfect. Maybe she's just trying to flex outside the house 'cause she can't flex at home anymore. She, she got married. &gt;&gt; JOSH: Who's gonna crack first? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm obviously gonna win. &gt;&gt; CHEF: Hi, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; CHEF: Say hello to the pretty girls. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My brother thinks you guys are all really hot. So be careful. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Too many things going on at one time. Tonight it's Kim's engagement party at my house, and I'm so excited. I think my house is looking phenomenal. A lot of hard work has gone into this. But anything for Kim. Hey, guys. Happy engagement party, Kris. Whoo! Look at the boobs on this one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Geez, I mean... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hey! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! Khloe and Kourtney did the most amazing job. Just getting beautiful flowers and putting candles everywhere. It looked so beautiful. &gt;&gt; MAN: Have you guys thought about where you're gonna live? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, he has to live wherever he'll play. &gt;&gt; MAN: Right, right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Obviously, once we have kids and they're in school, we have... &gt;&gt; MAN: Kris with a kid. Oh, my goodness. 'Cause he's still a kid. &gt;&gt; KIM: He really is. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's up with you, man? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Chilling. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Chilling? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm in shock, you know? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Why are you in shock? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I never thought I'd be at one of these things for myself, you know? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You want to make God laugh? Tell him your plans. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, that was very profound. I was feeling that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What? I'm trying to rap with my man right here. What's up? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's what I have to look forward to right there. &gt;&gt; JORDAN: Get used to it, kiddo. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We're having a guy moment and Khloe, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We were just trying to chill out, and Khloe just kinda butts in. But it's her house, so she can go where she wants to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris and Kim? Kris and Kim? Come over here. Attention, attention. The witch is dead. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who's the witch? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kris Jenner. Kidding. Our mother wishes she was here, but she took a week off of life. Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So we just wanted to... &gt;&gt; MASON: Mama! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, Mason, it's your mom. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mama! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We just wanted to thank everyone for coming, for celebrating Kim and Kris's engagement. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim and Kris, we wish you nothing but the best and a long future together, till death do you part. Death, 26-year-old. Death till you part. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right, enough. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, we just... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Seriously, do you want me to pour this glass of wine on your head? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kris, for two minutes, be nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Seriously. Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know what it is between Khloe and Kris, but I just hope that they get over it, and they don't bring any of this drama to my wedding. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Isn't it kinda crazy that right now, like, Kim's getting married? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim falls in love with everyone. And that's great. But her nickname isn't "Elizabeth Taylor" just for the diamonds. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So do you like him? Do you like Kris? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I like Kris, but I don't know Kris. We all don't feel like Kris makes an effort to know us. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm trying to ease tension with Khloe and I go upstairs to thank her, and bam! I know when you're talking bad about me. I walked in here; I felt it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not talking bad about you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You guys both are like this right when I walk in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just saying... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not talking bad about you. I'm just saying I'm not really sure the intentions in this entire situation. I just hope that everyone is thinking it through. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Okay. How, how...? You guys... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Listen, I'm hoping that your intentions are pure. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What are you trying to say? That I like this world, and that's why I'm with Kim? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. Is this very opportunistic of you? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Opportunistic would be like, hey, I'm trying to come up off of Kim or, hey, Kim's trying to... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you have come up off of Kim. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wow, I'm going to kill this girl. Khloe's questioning my motives with Kim. I feel like she's one to talk. She got married in three weeks trying to shock Hollywood, basically. How dare you question someone else's marriage? Are you sure you're not just using Lamar? He's a Laker. He's got championships. Out there, are you going to find like a tall successful guy to have kids with? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's a billion of them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think I've married Lamar because he's tall and a Laker? That's... that's really fab. Listen, Kim has been my sister for 27 years. Kim is someone who falls in love heavy. And when she falls in love, she loves hard. Do I believe that every time she's been in love, she believes it? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: So you're saying that I'm just like the fourth or fifth dude in this...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. I'm not saying that, but I'm hoping because Kim is a hopeless romantic, and Kim has the best intentions in the world... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I've never been married. Well, she's been on the level every guy she dates. So maybe I should question her intentions. 1081 00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:25,383 There's sacrifices both ways. You know what I mean? All right, baby. Let's go home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you say good-bye to Khloe? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yep. 1086 00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:42,300 &gt;&gt; KIM: Everything cool? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you nervous to see Mom's face? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kind of. Are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't want her to do it in the first place. I thought she was gorg before. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've just heard like afterwards, like, your face can look so crazy, like a mummy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want her to look like herself, just like refreshed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I want her to look like the best version of herself. I think she'll look fab, hopefully. And, if not, we'll just have to lie and tell her she does. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Has Kim said anything about me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just assumed that she's pissed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe 'cause he didn't want her to know that you guys... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Got into a fight? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Got into it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm waiting for her to yell at me. Kim hasn't mentioned anything about the argument Hump and I had. Typically, Kim loves to confront. So maybe Hump hasn't said anything to her? I would feel bad if they got married, and then I said it later, you know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At least I said my part, and that's it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you say it just to him? 1113 00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:54,739 Have you ever said it to Kim? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mother? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where the hell is Mom? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's been a few weeks. Kris's surgery has healed. It's time for the big reveal. And in the typical Kris Jenner way, she's going to make a grand entrance. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Madre? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going through your drawer. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get out of my room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to make an entrance. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your hair is like shorter than a vagina's bush, and you take so long. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fine. Did you get in? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Everything in this family is an extravaganza. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would like to think of myself as the biggest extravaganza of them all. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here I come. Are you guys ready? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ready as we'll ever be. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you guys think? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All the... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like your neck doesn't look like leather anymore. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, all the tubes are gone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I guess that's a good thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you really do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was afraid you were going to look like Catwoman, but you're just dressed like cat. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seeing how amazing my mom's face looks and how great of a reaction everyone's having 'cause they all think she looks amazing-- it's-- I'm, like, kind of proud. Like, okay I said this all along, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They, like, basically took my face off and put it back together. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow, that's great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your neck looks so much better. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KIM: You honestly look great. You look exactly like yourself, just 15 years younger. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim has been so amazing through this whole process. She cancelled everything she had, and she came to the surgery center with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going to just be right here, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, Kim. Not one of my other children stepped foot inside the surgery center. I think there's something wrong with that. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, you guys, I made the decision of who's gonna design my wedding dress. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Drum roll. Drum roll. It is... &gt;&gt; KIM: Vera Wang! &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, Vera Wang is kind of like the queen of wedding gowns. And with my personal relationship with her, I feel like there's no other choice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel so relieved. Following in your younger sister's footsteps, aren't you? &gt;&gt; VERA: Are you so excited? I'm like, crazy happy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go find Kim a dress. &gt;&gt; VERA: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm at Vera Wang's for my first dress fitting. And Vera honestly has thousands of options. This is a pretty special moment. 1169 00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:39,303 Where are my sisters? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is your dress. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You're just like a princess. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You look like a princess. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That has to be your dress. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm trying the other one on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love this dress. I do think this is something very you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: I love it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Love that. Or this one. &gt;&gt; KIM: Or this one? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, it's a little more than a month until the wedding. And there are so many gorgeous dresses. I really cannot make up my mind. It's like I want to show Kris so badly, and be like, which one do you think? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You cannot show the groom. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you make maternity dresses? &gt;&gt; VERA: I could. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now we're on baby 1188 00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:18,509 watch. &gt;&gt; VERA: Oh, my God. OMG. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. What can I do for you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim gave that to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, that's very nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's on your mind? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I remember when I got married, you made such a strong point about making sure Lamar and I were protected 'cause we were getting married so fast. And you made sure that, you know, we had a prenup, and it was in line. And all the prenup stuff was going on. And I'm just making sure that you are protecting Kourtney and I with this union. Because all of our company, it's like everything that we own is together. And now our companies are only bigger, me, Kourtney and Kim. And we only have more of a brand to protect. Hello? You're acting like me. Like, I just start dialing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you're starting to make me really... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: May I help you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Elizabeth, please. It's Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay. Hold on one moment. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, I want to make sure our brand is protected, and Kourtney and I are protected. I feel like that's a serious, serious thing to not have signed. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. Um, really quick. I'm sitting here with Khloe. And she just reminded me and brought up a good point. Is Kim really, really, definitely covered with a prenup? &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: Well, it's not signed, sealed and delivered. We've already gone back and forth with his attorney. And we're working things out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Would you call me the minute it's signed? &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: Yes, I'll call you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks, Elizabeth. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: At the end of the day, she'll thank us all later when she still has a place to live. That's Lammy. Thanks for taking care of this. Got to go meet Lamar. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; MARK: How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. Mark is a florist that we use all the time. He just has a way with making everything so romantic and so beautiful. There's so much to choose from. &gt;&gt; MARK: It doesn't have to be this bouquet, but you could tell me, oh, I like-- like the stephanotis. I love this flower because it's fragrant. &gt;&gt; KIM: That one's really gorgeous. This I really like but too simple. This is really pretty, but I don't like the greenery. Like this might be too delicate. The rose is kind of gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We like this. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I really like that, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like this. Are these real diamonds? &gt;&gt; MARK: They could be. &gt;&gt; KIM: These are all so gorg. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're so gorg. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, stop. I'm your daughter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Of course you'd say that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I appreciate you, Kimmy. And I love you so much. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thanks, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. Why so sentimental? Oops. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was just thinking about how you go through things in life, and you start to really appreciate things that really matter. That whole experience of having my face done and being put to sleep, and I was so, so scared. And you know the only one who really cared, Kimmy, was you. Thank you, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Good night. I love you. I'm gonna sleep this way. So if you need me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nobody else even came to the hospital to visit me. All they ever really want to talk to me about is business or where's the next deal coming from. And it's not like a personal relationship anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know my siblings love my mom obviously. But sometimes they take my mom for granted. They should know that my mom's feelings are hurt and that she really feels like, you know, everyone's not there for her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's so pretty. &gt;&gt; MARK: What do you think? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's great, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is like so real. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Yeah, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here you go, honey. To another fabulous, fabulous wedding. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Whoo-hoo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here we go. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Let's get the party going, whoo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Yay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sharon Sacks, our wedding planner, is here to go over a bunch of wedding ideas. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's the A-team, Sharon and Robyn and Cori, who are here to give you the wedding of your dreams. Your wish is their command. It's like Cinderella. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, Kris really wanted to be involved. I have to Skype him. Kris? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe, this is Sharon. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Hi, Kris. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, okay. So we have to come up with color schemes. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I just want it to be like-- like a... &gt;&gt; KIM: Black, white and sparkle. Want to do black, white and sparkle? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Um... I don't like sparkles. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, but I do. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Who are you marrying? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, who are you marrying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is the queen of bling. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Listen, I mean, I don't want it to be too girly. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris really wants to be involved 'cause he doesn't want to just show up the day of our wedding and feel like he had no hand in anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kris, we want to know what your wish list is. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I like a casino theme, you know. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no. But a wedding is like the bride's day. I definitely want him to have his say, but don't get crazy with it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going to build the church of Kim. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: 'Cause isn't that all it's about? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: The church of Kim? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was joking. &gt;&gt; KIM: You there? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This is kind of crazy. You don't want me involved in my own wedding? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can be involved as much as you want. &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe, you're going to be involved. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's very sensitive. Whatever. &gt;&gt; SHARON: That was crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim has called me over to talk about something. And I know Kim is going to go off on me right now. Kim? I know that she's going to scream at me about saying that Kris is opportunistic. I'm hoping that your intensions are pure. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What are you trying to say? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. Is this very opportunistic of you? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Opportunistic would be like, "Hey, I'm trying to come up off of Kim." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you have come up off of Kim. What's going on? Of course, I'm going to get all the blame for everything. 1319 00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:36,820 But I'm being honest, and Kim should know that's how I am. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's under your bed right now? Are you a junk food hoarder? &gt;&gt; ROB: Whatever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, we're going to your room. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: We're going to your room, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't like people going through my stuff. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I think he's a little ashamed that he's a Porky Pig. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Remember your dream location for the wedding? We got the location! &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, the best news. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim and her mom booked the location without me even knowing about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just wanted to talk to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, Mom is, like, really hurt that no one really stepped up to, like, take care of her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I guess Hump hasn't said anything to her about the fight. Thank God. No Humphries conversation. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think we really need to do something to make Mom feel that at least we're, like, there for her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just had no idea. Of course I want to make it right. Mom does so much for us. You know, I want her to feel like we care what happens, that we're there and supporting her. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think we really need to call Kourtney and Rob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, call them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE and KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: We wanted to conference you in with Rob. Do you have a sec? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, hold on. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Robby. I wanted to talk to all of you, because I think we should all do something, like, really nice for Mom so she feels like we're all, like, really there for her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't we all go to her house and, like, I'll cook dinner for everyone, and we could just hang out. Like, she's always cooking us dinner. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, you could rub her feet. &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's, like, the least we can do. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Hi. It's Sharon. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You must be Sharon. Thanks for meeting with me. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Are you kidding? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm back from Minnesota. I didn't really feel like I was being heard over Skype. I love finer things in life, but I'll also go to a dive restaurant that has really good cheeseburger. And I feel like I need to meet with the wedding planner and let her know that I'm involved. &gt;&gt; SHARON: So glad we finally get to meet. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I know. Heard a lot of good things about you. I wanted to be involved in the process. &gt;&gt; SHARON: I want you to be involved in the process. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I love food, so I could have input on that. &gt;&gt; SHARON: I would love that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you guys? &gt;&gt; SHARON: Ooh, I think Kris is here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim booked a meeting to meet with Sharon, and she couldn't make it. So she calls me in a panic, saying, "Get over there. I want to make sure everything's perfect. And don't let him change a thing on that menu." I'm here because I want this one to feel like he's in the loop. What's your favorite entree, Kris? Like, if you had to eat anything, what would you pick? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We could do burgers. Five Guys burgers, have a little truck. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A truck? Why don't we have Wolfgang make sliders and his grilled cheese... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What about a little stand? Have you ever been to the state fair when they have those little hot fresh cookies? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The state fair? &gt;&gt; SHARON: For the after-party? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, this is a really elegant wedding. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: For the after-party, like, little cookies. I have all these ideas about the food. She's telling me no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You will never be able to recreate this night as long as you live. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I feel like she just showed up to shoot down all my ideas. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I think what we... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I had an idea. Sorry to interrupt you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What about-- I wanted Mason to walk down the aisle with the ring on the back of one of my dog's neck while he's carrying him down the aisle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Ugh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wow, Mase. Tonight, we are cooking dinner at Khloe's house. We need to do the scrapbook, 'cause Mom's coming in ten minutes. We are making a bunch of scrapbooks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's page one with the diamond hearts. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom spends all of her day taking care of us, and we do appreciate her. And we really want to show her that we really love her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to see one of Mom? That's Mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wow. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: They had, like, mustaches when they were kids. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Second page is in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's Mason? Gumby! Hello, Charlie Brown. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I know I said it was just going to be you and me, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I have a little treat for you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Surprise! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Surprise! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, this is a "we all still love you" party. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That is amazing. Oh. This is going to make me cry. What is this for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We felt bad that you thought no one was there for you during your surgery. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, this is so cute. Can you get me a Kleenex, Scott? Oh, my God. Oh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom starts tearing up when she's looking at our little love box that we made. And I'm just so glad that she knows how much we appreciate her. We wanted you to come here to celebrate how much we love and appreciate you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, look at me and you in matching outfits. It means so much that my kids all got together tonight to celebrate me. Look at Khloe. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Look at Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And the fact that everybody stopped what they were doing to tell me how much they love me means everything. I'm a really, really lucky mom. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you too, Rob. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Robert, this is weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You smell good. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's up, dude? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come here. Don't you want to sign this? It's for your pistachio deal. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: Um, so, last night, I just woke up in the middle of the night. I went to the McDonald's, then I went to-- what is it?-- the Dunkin Donuts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you being serious? &gt;&gt; ROB: Bible. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: This summer, Rob was supposed to, like, go work out and go be in shape. And then I would, like-- 2:00, 3:00 in the morning, I could hear him in the pantry. I think he's a-a Porky Pig. Are you a junk food hoarder? What's under your bed right now? &gt;&gt; ROB: The coffee cakes have been, like, my number one go-to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, we're going to your room. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: We're going to your room, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yes. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't like people going through my stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, this was all under your bed. Lamar, how long has that been here for? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's a bear claw. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't get why you get so mad at me. Like, he's clearly the reason why I eat like this. When I lived alone, I never had food like this in my house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, stop. Robert, if you keep eating like that, you're gonna be bloated at the wedding. &gt;&gt; ROB: I do worry about my body. I'm a dude, and I weigh 200 pounds. For me, that's a lot. Yeah. It sucks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, a moment on the lips is a lifetime on the hips. Do you know how long that will take to get off your body? Lamar, give me the Fruit Roll-Up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, doll. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. So I want to talk to you about, um, the cars for the wedding. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've got the guys here, Bruce and David. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I want to introduce you. I'm really excited, because EmpireCLS is coming by Kim's house today to show her the cars that I booked for the wedding. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Nice to meet you. This is Bruce. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? I'm kind of obsessed with the Maybach. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Well, this is the 57S, and this is the sport version. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Gorgeous. I've asked David and Bruce to do one car for Bruce and myself, one car for Lamar and Khloe and Rob. &gt;&gt; KIM: What about Kris's parents and his sister? They're a part of the bridal party as well. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. I never did anything about Kris's family. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Really? You got your whole side of the family lined up in Rolls-Royces and... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel bad, Kris, so I apologize. 1495 01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,783 I'll make sure that your parents definitely have a car. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Perfect. I didn't want to bring this up, but I overheard Khloe talking &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not okay. I'm definitely confronting her. &gt;&gt; ROB: Look at this pillow. They put pillows just here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you just break that? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what I love? That triangle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at that square cake up there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I love that. My family uses Hansen's all the time. I mean, they did Khloe and Lamar's wedding cake. They did Mason's first birthday cake. And I couldn't imagine having a wedding without Hansen's cake. You guys, let's all sit down here. Do we have forks? Look at this chocolate chip cookie dough one! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm not eating any because I-I don't eat sweets. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to try the wedding cake. It's traditional for you to have a taste of the wedding cake. &gt;&gt; KIM: You've got to try our wedding cake. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't eat sweets. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ever since the fight between Kris and Khloe at the engagement party, Khloe cannot stand Kris. You know, she keeps texting me how much she hates Kris, how much she hates his voice. Like, Khloe, chill out. It's not that serious. He's going to be your brother-in-law. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's do this butter-free one. We'll do different tiers. This is so good, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe we'll do the white with the chocolate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's good. I like the other two. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, that was for Mom! &gt;&gt; ROB: That one's really good, the carrot cake. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Carrot cake is good here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob, like-- when you go to the bathroom, all of this will be gone. And he's like, "Oh, they washed the dishes." Like, he'll just-- He eats it all. Rob has got-- gained at least 30 pounds. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I gain 30 pounds, and people are like, "She's pregnant with twins." Typically, I would not be the one to criticize anybody's weight, since I, in my family, is known as the "fat, chubby one." But I think Robert is not capable of controlling himself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: His ass is out of of control. You're not going to fit into your tux. &gt;&gt; ROB: I have been eating healthy, Mom. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Make sure that you put the cake away, so Rob doesn't sneak back here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Kim. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, it's really not cool that everybody's picking on me, trying to call me fat boy or whatever. I'm trying to lose weight. I'm trying to be healthy. And I'm going to lose weight before the wedding. I don't need to worry about whatever they're saying. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: He's got that Kardashian tush. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom, stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me see. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me see. I gave birth to it. Let me see it. 1556 01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:23,266 &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom, stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Baby. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I totally know from all the food and, like, the grocery lists and all the girls... they, like... they have to keep buying-- Rob is eating way more than what he's, like, even letting onto. So I found this. It makes the loudest noise. Look. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Damn, that is loud. But what... I don't understand it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's like the detector, so you know when the door opens and separates. Like, you know someone broke in. Here, come here. Now, when Rob goes and gets some junk food and he lies and says he's not, now we'll know, and we'll, like, catch him and be like, "Ha ha." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: That's crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Watch. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You can't put it where he can see it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He'll never look up when he opens the door. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Why not? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He won't look. Now, when you open it... Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now, when we go to bed tonight, now we'll know. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Should we turn it on, or do you need to go in here? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Nah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, once I turn it on, you're not... 'cause we're going to know if Rob's taking food or not. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I guess I'll go in here first. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, get what you want. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. Shark Bites. My tasty bake shop... tasty bake shop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, you ready? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. Tasty bake shop. Tasty bake shop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, it's on, so you can't go in there. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: He's going to be 1592 01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:49,752 embarrassed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who cares? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What do they want us to do in the pistachio commercial? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We don't have to say a word. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What did they say I have to wear? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have to wear a green T-shirt-- that's it. We don't change or anything. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Why don't you wear green? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can wear green, I'm sure. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Got his ass. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The alarm went off. See? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Got his ass! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I told you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: We got his ass. Youfat boy! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I totally knew this time was going to come. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: We got you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Caught you red-handed, baby. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've been served! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Are you embarrassed? &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe and Lamar think it's funny to, like, catch me trying to get junk food or whatever. I mean, I personally don't think it's funny. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is when food sticks on you the most, 'cause you're just going to eat and go to sleep. Just admit that you have a binging problem and you, like, can't control yourself. &gt;&gt; ROB: You are the cause of this. I was super healthy before I moved in here. If it wasn't for all the junk food and everything in this house, I would still be doing what I used to be doing and working out. But, you know, it's their fault essentially. If I lived at Kourt's house, I guarantee you I would be... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, you're addicted to food. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's okay, man. It's okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Brotherly love. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Lady, how are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? Sorry that we are a little late. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: We are meeting to make our own scent of candles for our wedding. I think that's really cool. I mean, I've never really heard of that before. That's interesting. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's too girly. &gt;&gt; KIM: This? A full man's cedar and leather scent. Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just got a call from the guy up in Montecito. Do you remember your dream location for the wedding that you wanted? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Please tell me it's available. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We got the location! &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom and I absolutely love it. It's perfection. This is exactly where I imagine my wedding to be. This is gorgeous. I love it out here. I know that Kris wants to be involved, but decisions have to be made, like, ASAP. We don't have time. We're planning this, like, massive wedding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, this is iconic. I never thought in a million years. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, the best news ever. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim and her mom booked the location behind my back. This is unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's so disrespectful to me. You're not going to make decisions for me. We're going to make decisions together. This can't go on. I can't live like this. 1655 01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:28,411 Seriously, this will, like, make the whole wedding. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll hold the wheel. You eat. &gt;&gt; ROB: Honestly, eating tacos is the best experience. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who went to Taco ...? &gt;&gt; KIM: I want you involved, but I seriously have been planning this dream wedding since I was ten years old. It's a girl thing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Then you could just slot any guy into it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe? &gt;&gt; ROB: Bye, Khlo. Bitch. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Bobby. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Welcome home, my friend. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob! Welcome home. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kourtney is really positive about me eating healthy. That's, like, here lifestyle. That's how I want my lifestyle to be. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should we take you to your room? &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, I need to be, like, around people that are on the same boat as me. Why is it so hot in here? Is this, like, part of your trick to, like, get... make me lose weight? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is. We're going to... I'm going to turn on the heat when you're sleeping at night so you can lose a few LBs. We'll go on walks with Mason. We'll eat healthy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just let him relax. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going to wake up in the morning. We'll keep all these blinds open so you get up nice and early. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: These herbs-- I make tea, and I drink this three times a day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And look at how good she looks-- healthy, young. &gt;&gt; ROB: What the hell is this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look, taste one. Kourt, kale and crunch-- that's disgusting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This can replace your Cheeto addiction. Bible, you'll like it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Bible, this is disgusting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Isn't it good? &gt;&gt; ROB: Kourtney is very healthy. She's trying to help me. She's trying to, like, influence me in a great way, and that's what I need. All right, I'm going to go hang out with Mason or something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: Thanks. Here, you want to read another book? Pick a book. Give me a kiss. 1697 01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:28,831 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't worry. I'll clean up all these dishes. &gt;&gt; OSH: How you doing? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: How are you? Kris. &gt;&gt; OSH: Osh. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Nice to meet you. This is Josh, Peter. &gt;&gt; OSH: Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; PETER: How are you? Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Finally getting fitted with my boys. We just get to hang out, do what we do. A couple of these guys, I've never really seen them in a tux before, so it's kind of exciting and fun. I'm not trying to put him on blast. We've been working out hard. &gt;&gt; ROB: I haven't got invited. &gt;&gt; JOSH: He actually coming with us? &gt;&gt; ROB: I haven't got invited. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: He's going to shed a few pounds. Dude, I did a double workout today-- Barry's Boot Camp in the morning, then I went to... &gt;&gt; ROB: Wow. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I mean, just not fair. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, Rob, you don't work out unless you have a $500 trainer. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's not true. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: There's no way getting around getting on a treadmill and running and feeling the pain. I'm just saying, there's no substitute for really just... &gt;&gt; ROB: If I'm going to have a six-pack by the wedding... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're not going to. &gt;&gt; ROB: A four-pack. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Four weeks? Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; MAN: I love you, Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Charlene! Why does Kim feel like she can show up? I don't go to her dress fittings. &gt;&gt; CHARLENE: So this is the cream for the wedding. So this is the cream tux for him and the black shoes. &gt;&gt; KIM: And is there the satin stripe down the... &gt;&gt; CHARLENE: Yep, and the tuxedo is striped. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; CHARLENE: And then, for the reception, I was going to change him into the black tuxedo jacket. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm a little frustrated with her right now. This is a guy moment. This is a guy moment. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, why are these girls always messing it up? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: She's so controlling throughout this process. Lamar, I need your opinion, man. I know you've been through this. How do I handle all this stress? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: The stress? That's going to... that's going to happen, like, all the way until the... the day of. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott and Josh, we're thinking cummerbunds. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think everyone should wear them. &gt;&gt; ROB: Remember the good old days when you and I would pick up about 20 tacos and kick it back old-school? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ah, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, baby, and a Bell on the side. &gt;&gt; ROB: I need a junk food fix, like, now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Isn't that the main reason you moved out was to try to start eating healthy again? &gt;&gt; ROB: Dicky boy, you're not going to tell Kourt if I get a burrito, right? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, man. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm a dude. I'm... I like to, you know, have my days where I let go, enjoy and cheat and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Cheat days? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you're down to cheat today, I'll cheat today with you. &gt;&gt; ROB: I am. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Chips. I'm going to let Rob eat whatever he wants because the truth is, he's not going to lose weight doing this, and he needs to realize that his eating problems are his own. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hi. Could I get the taco 12-pack? Could I have four super burritos, please? May I have the supreme nachos with sour cream and extra cheese? And an order of six churros. Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, &gt;&gt; ROB: It's been like a week of eating healthy, and I need my fix. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Taco? &gt;&gt; ROB: Kind of have to eat them in the car because can't eat them in the house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh-uh. Here, dude. I'll hold the wheel. You eat. &gt;&gt; ROB: Honestly, eating tacos is so awesome. It is, like, the best experience. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, you put that down quick. You haven't had food like this in a while. Dude, if... by the way, if Kourtney finds out that you ate tacos and all that, she'll be pissed at me. Let's make pretend we're taking, like, a wheatgrass shot. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. What up? Doll, do you want to get healthy with Rob and I? We're just going to do wheatgrass shots before bed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll take the, um, wellness shot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, so we'll do wheatgrass; she'll do wellness. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, one, two, three. Ugh. Oh, that's not that bad. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So why are you making a face like you just took a shot of? &gt;&gt; ROB: 'Cause it was. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you feel so much better already? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys, who went to Taco ...? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm so tired. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's exhausted, darling. He probably just wants to go... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob, why would you have Taco ... when you're eating if you're going to... &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm fine... I was fine... I'm fine having it once in a blue moon. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, there's healthy options here. I'm just saying that you tend to not take responsibility. Like, it's on you. &gt;&gt; ROB: I didn't blame anyone else. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe and Lamar? &gt;&gt; ROB: I do have my own problem. I mean, Kourtney gave me, like, all the healthy food, she gave me the perfect environment, and I obviously needed to get my, like, junk food fix in, and... I'm to blame. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Be responsible. You're an adult. You could eat whatever you want. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Shoot me straight here-- what's the entertainment? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, right now, it's Robin Thicke. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Which is a great choice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. All right, so why don't we explore Christina? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, what? I love her. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah, but I just don't like Christina Aguilera, her whole look. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're letting him choose? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, we're calling Christina. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah, you're letting me choose. If I have to stand there and listen to that... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't have to. We'll just talk about it later. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I heard that. No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then I've ordered the Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. One box per car. Six doughnuts in the shape of hearts. Yeah. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You guys, no one wants doughnuts in their car. &gt;&gt; KIM: We do. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's going to be hot. Look, you guys... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's going to be nighttime. It'll be like 11:00 at night. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What if someone has a really nice car, they don't want like doughnuts in there to... &gt;&gt; KIM: They're going to hand them to you right when you get in. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You guys should just marry each other. &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe, I seriously have been planning this dream wedding since I was ten years old. Like, it's such a girl thing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah, then you could just slot any guy into it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe? Honestly, if you don't love this location, I have the check in my bag, and I will rip it up. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Then there's going to be a huge floral positioned right in the center. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: What would ever make you believe that you can say something like that to Kris? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone else is having concerns. I'm just doing what everyone else is saying behind your back. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've made Kris feel like the wedding is just about me, and I feel bad. This is definitely our wedding, and he needs to have a say on major decisions. Now I really just need to take Kris to Santa Barbara to see this home and have him just fall in love the way I did. If you-- honestly, if you don't love this location, I have the check in my bag and I will rip it up if you aren't happy here, 'cause I want you in the loop. &gt;&gt; SHARON: So the guests come in. And there's going to be a huge floral of orchids positioned right in the center. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at how pretty. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't this stunning? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so in love with this location. It would really break my heart if Kris didn't love this place the way I do. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Look to your left. 1858 01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:41,997 That's were the wedding's going to be. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This is awesome. Wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Pretty, right? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Nice. &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't this stunning? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's very stunning. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you feel the love here? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm having flashes of my life with you beginning. &gt;&gt; SHARON: Aw! &gt;&gt; KIM: Aw! &gt;&gt; SHARON: Sweet love. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm really excited. You guys did this behind my back, but it turned out well. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so excited that Kris loves this location. &gt;&gt; SHARON: We have 12 violins, two horns and a harp. Straight ahead is going to be your chapel. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going to walk down this entire thing from before the fountain. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This is great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Now I think he can understand why I chose it, and maybe he can start to understand that I know what I'm doing here. Look, I know you're annoyed that I haven't really kept you in the loop, and I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This is a great location. I love it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You do? You really do? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I-I really love it. And I want to get married here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bible? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Bible. I want to get married here. I just don't want to end up like Scott and Bruce. Like not having any say and just basically living life in the passenger seat-- not even the... &gt;&gt; KIM: But that's them. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: ...the backseat, you know? That's my biggest fear, but I want you to have your dream wedding so... &gt;&gt; KIM: Our dream wedding. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're the best, baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, well, well, look what the cat drug in. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's kind of embarrassing coming back into the house after trying to be all healthy. But this is my home, and I'm way happier here than I will be with Kourtney 'cause I cannot eat like she does. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, I heard you had a fun time at Kourt's house. &gt;&gt; ROB: Don't really want to talk about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I know exactly what happened. I just want you to admit that it's not about living here, about all this food. It's just about you have no self-control. And no matter what, you're still going to go to Taco ... &gt;&gt; ROB: I get it. I'm a binge eater, and I love eating. I just need to eat better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does this mean you're moving back in? I'm confused. &gt;&gt; ROB: I hate when Khloe's right, but I'm to blame 'cause I got a eating problem. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, I dropped the Cosby kids off at the Super Bowl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you excited to see Rob? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow. I think you like destroyed him. &gt;&gt; LAMAR:love, bro. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm gonna go in my room. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm glad to see you home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, if you fart again... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What'd you say? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God... ugh! 1917 01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:21,557 Oh, Bible, those smell like you in your pants. &gt;&gt; KIM: I almost want, like, the wedding to be over so we can just enjoy our lives. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, what happened to us? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I just want to, like, jump past it and, like, have a photo book of what happened so we can look back on it. &gt;&gt; KIM: And be like that we the most stressful time of our lives. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously, why all the stress? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: 'Cause you're just like a different crew. Like it's-- it's like there's no men in your family. It's just really weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I mean its just so female dominated. I feel like I gotta get, like, four women to fall in love with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why would you randomly say that? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I just, you know... I mean, I just don't necessarily always feel that, you know, that they're all that into me, you know? &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean? Did someone say something? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No. Please tell me if someone said something. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I didn't want to tell Kim that me and Khloe got into it. But I want to have as open of a relationship as I can with Kim. So I don't want to bring this up, but... I overhead Khloe, uh, talking and I confronted her. &gt;&gt; KIM: When? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: At the engagement dinner. &gt;&gt; KIM: Weeks ago? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, tell me, what did Khloe say? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: She was just like, it's you know, is your motives right? Is this, you know, too soon, this and that, like she's your dad or something. &gt;&gt; KIM: Too soon? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm hoping that your intentions are pure. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: How dare you question someone else's marriage. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. Why is she-- like, you don't go there. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I feel like it's all a competition with you and your sister. &gt;&gt; KIM: This isn't a competition, and you should wish someone the best. Why is she wishing evil upon us? As much as I felt a certain way about Khloe and Lamar, I didn't say anything. I let her have her moment. I supported her, and we didn't even know Lamar. I'm just asking for the same respect back. Why are you just now telling me that she's like interrogating you, making you feel like She's, like, definitely not one to talk. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm never going to say anything to her about it, but it's just annoying. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, why wouldn't you say something to her? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Well, because I don't want to... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going to say something to her. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't want to... No, you're not. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I am. How dare you say something like that. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Look, there's always haters out there. You just happen to have... &gt;&gt; KIM: Haters, but haters shouldn't be... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You happen to have one in your family. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's exactly what Khloe is being. And I don't want that negative energy or negative-- any negativity on our special day. That's not okay. I'm definitely confronting her. Kris feels that you just hate him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just doing what everyone else is saying behind your back. &gt;&gt; KIM: But no one else is talking about him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone was. They just didn't say it to his face. &gt;&gt; ROB: You have a lazy eye... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: These are all pictures that... &gt;&gt; ROB: ...in that eye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everybody--every human being has a lazy eye. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's what I heard. I thought he did that smile like-- to like-- have a swagger thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I was talking to Kris, and he told me that at the engagement party you were being nasty and had a talk with him upstairs about how we're getting married too soon. Like what would ever make you believe that you can say something like that to Kris? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, he's a young kid, and I just don't want you to be hurt. I'm protective over you, and that's all I was saying to Kris. I was really trying not to attack him. But then Kris said you're only with Lamar because he's a Laker, and there's no way you could know you want to get married after nine days. &gt;&gt; KIM: He always feels that you just hate him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think he says disrespectful things to me and to Mom and to Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's joking. You guys just don't know his personality. And you guys don't even give it a shot to get to know him and talkabout him behind his back, but... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I don't talk about him behind his back. I said it to his face. That's what's frustrating. Everyone else is talking Everyone else is having concerns. I'm just doing what everyone else is saying behind your back. &gt;&gt; KIM: But no one else is talking about him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone was. The just didn't say it to his face. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe's saying that everyone's talking about Kris behind his back. But she's the one that's, like, really stirring it up. She's the one that's creating all this drama. I don't want any of this bad energy at my wedding. And if all of you are talking behind my back, there's no reason why any of you should be at my wedding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I didn't. All I'm doing is telling you what's being said behind your back. Kim? So what, you don't want me at 2026 01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:47,422 your wedding? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I don't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tomorrow night on Kim and Kris' Fairy Tale Wedding: &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, kitty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a wedding day, people. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I'm going to change my last name to Humphries. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are incorporated. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are so selfish. I'm not just going to go live in your place in Minnesota. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm not. We're 150 people over the seating limit. We deal was scheduled for this-- &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Do you want me to start dis-inviting people? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. This is not correct. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm not doing this right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are forgetting what all of this is supposed to be about. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The wedding is finally here. 2043 01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:23,825 &gt;&gt; KIM: This is more than I ever could have dreamed of.
