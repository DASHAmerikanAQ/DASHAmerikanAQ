- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get busy living or get busy dying, baby. &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I got a tattoo that says "Get busy living or get busy dying." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He watched a documentary of a girl who had a muscular disease and ran a marathon. And her quote was, "Get busy living or get busy dying." So the next day, he got tatted on his stomach. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: She inspired me so much. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Comes back... Get this thing out of here. Get that thing away from me. That's a beast. &gt;&gt; KIM: Haven't you ever wanted to crowd surf? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't crowd surf on two people. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've never been crowd surfing. Can I crowd surf on Rob? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar won't even look that way. Look. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, oh, okay, scoot closer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna have the head, not the butt. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I get the butt. 21 00:00:55,122 --> 00:01:00,627 &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but I'm close to Lamar's penis. Not worth it, not worth it, not worth it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not worth it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Salud. Salud. You should go like this. Why do you get allergies or something? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We all got really bad allergies in Dallas &gt;&gt; KIM: You're just allergic to Dallas. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe. Remember in New York when we made Kourtney's bathtub an aquarium... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...and Mason loved it? He was, like, "Whee!" He, like, thought it was like the best thing ever. I mean, a fish is a good training tool for kids to learn, like, you have to feed it every day. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like he would really want a dog. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney was, like, you would die. There's gonna be a new baby coming. It's too much responsibility. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know that Kourt has been really nervous about how Mason is gonna, like, react to his little sister and meeting her for the first time. So as Aunt Kiki, I just want to get Mason a present. I really think it's, like, appropriate to get a little fish. That's, like, perfect. &gt;&gt; MJ: Shannon &amp; Company. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; MJ: Hey, Kris, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just called to say hi and check up on you. &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, that's nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you have fun while we were there in San Diego? &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, I really enjoyed San Diego. I really did. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had so much fun. Can I ask you a really crazy question, and you won't think it's weird? &gt;&gt; MJ: Sure, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, do you remember when we were talking after Papa died, you said that you were going to get a plot for yourself next to his? &gt;&gt; MJ: Right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you do that? &gt;&gt; MJ: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you get one for me? &gt;&gt; MJ: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. So you left me out? &gt;&gt; MJ: No, actually, you could put two more people. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, so wait. There's a plot so you can have multiple people buried there? But what if you don't get cremated? I'm not sure I like this whole cremation situation. &gt;&gt; MJ: I would probably think for you guys, you should go out to little Hollywood and be buried next to Marilyn Monroe and all those people. They take people on Halloween and say: "This is where the Kardashians are." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Mom, you've been drinking or something. I'll see you later. &gt;&gt; MJ: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. Crazy lady. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, Mason...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mase, we have a present for you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's Kiki. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, you want to see? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a surprise. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here, you want to see it? Just close your eyes. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't show it to him yet. &gt;&gt; MASON: Maybe it's a dinosaur. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe it's a dinosaur? Okay... &gt;&gt; BOTH: ...one, two, three. &gt;&gt; MASON: Fishy! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We got you a fishy! Look, do you want to hold your fishy? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, you hold that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is your friend. Hold it. Oh, you're welcome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What enticed you to buy a fish? Kim and Khloe come over with some goldfish for Mason. I'm not a pet person. And I really don't want pets until my kids are old enough to ask for them themselves. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mason! We have two! we're gonna make this so cool, okay? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you guys gonna come back every day to feed the fish? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is a net so you can catch him You go, "Hey, I got you." &gt;&gt; KIM: So I got Mason a really cute fishbowl, and we got him two fish, one from me and one from Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This looks like Fruity Pebbles. &gt;&gt; MASON: There's two fishes in there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What should we name them? &gt;&gt; KIM: One from Kiki and and one for Koko. &gt;&gt; MASON: Fish. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, if it brings Mason some joy, then that makes me happy, but it's not my dream come true. Do you like them? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you want their names to be? &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to catch it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY/SCOTT: You want to catch it? &gt;&gt; MASON: Why do you... in there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why don't you name one "Fruity" and one "Pebbles"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So pretty, huh? It's Fruity and Pebbles. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, can you come in here so I can talk to you about something? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, actually, I'm watching aviation stuff, but what do you want? Come in here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, I just spent all this time with my mom, and I remember some of the worst memories of my mom are what she went through when my dad died. And I thought, "I never want my kids to be in the position where they have to make all these split decisions if something happens to one of us. I think it's a great idea to kind of make sure everything's in place just the way that I would like it. If something happens to me, then my family, my children, nobody has to worry about, you know, what to do. Maybe we should get these 12 plots or 25 plots or however how many people it adds up to. Or maybe even get one of those, like, situations where there's a mausoleum. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, so everybody could have their own drawer? What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris, you've lost your mind. You have. You really have. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want to be cremated or do you want to be buried? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't care. You deal with it. I don't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everyone's gonna die. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why would you leave the whole situation up to somebody else? Seriously. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 'Cause I'll be dead. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll actually have a little peace and quiet. It'll be great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get a massage. That's peace and quiet. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, when are you ready to go to lunch? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I'm coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Whoo, let's wheel this crane up. Whoop! &gt;&gt; MASON: Oh-oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh-oh. Have you been feeding your fishies? &gt;&gt; MASON: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you feed them today? I am playing with Mason in the playroom, and I am noticing not such a good sign. Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, one of the fish? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? How do you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's over... I saw it. I was just playing with Mason, and I saw it. Roar! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let me go look. Okay, play with Koko. I'll be right back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, there's no mistaking it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I told you. It's like it took a nosedive. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that's, like, traumatizing for the other one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I could get it out of there and just flush it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the exact reason why I don't like pets, because they die and it's very sad and tragic, and I would say the number one reason I've never had a dog or anything is because when I was little, my dog died. And, like, it was so heartbreaking for me and Kim. Both her and I hate dogs now because we just, like, could never get over it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye-- I'm assuming this is Pebbles. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, don't flush it. We got to take a picture. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Take a picture for what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: To get a new one. We need to know what it looks like. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think he knows what it looks like? He's two. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need a close-up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Perfect photo. So we flush this thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: With the eyes and everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Close the toilet and let it go in peace. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye-bye, Pebbles. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo! I see the mirror reflection of your ass lobes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, it's like two boobs. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom, stop looking. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Does anybody know what this is all about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, here's what I'm thinking. And this is what I wanted to talk to you guys about. So thanks for all coming. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, spit it out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been thinking, I really want to work out with this entire family about what we would ever do... &gt;&gt; ROB: I thought you meant 182 00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:23,363 like group workout. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...if somebody-- no-- if somebody passed away. There's a lot to do and I really want to make sure that everything's organized in the event that something happens to one of my family members. After what I went through with my dad and, um, you know, trying to figure that thing out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, if something happens to me, you're going to be hopefully sad about it. You're not going to make the right decisions. At least if I do it myself... &gt;&gt; KIM: What's a right decision? You get in a coffin, you get in the ground. What do you want me to do? What is going on with my mom? Something weird is up. Tell me what color you want. Temur-Pedic? What kind of pillow tops do you want in there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, you guys can make fun of me all you like, but seriously wouldn't it be great if we had like a Kardashian-Jenner... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Odom, Disick, like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Odom, Disick situation. &gt;&gt; ROB: Cemetery. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, the funeral business. Now, there you could extort us. Yeah, let's make some commissions on those plots, baby. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My kids want to make me feel like I've gone crazy, but it is very serious and it does take a lot of work and planning, and I just want to do it right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, basically ladies, I want to gift you guys with where we're going to end up the rest of our lives. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think my mom's idea of wanting to get a family burial plot is kind of ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In case something horrible happens, who would take care of Mason if something happens to you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It ain't either of you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I'm taken a little back by it, and I'm a little hurt that Kourtney 215 00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:06,866 doesn't look at me that way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have it all planned out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim's over there. She really wants you guys to take pictures of her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're at the fish store getting a fish for Mason. Ooh, how pretty. Are these real plants or no? &gt;&gt; CLERK: No, those are all fake. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's the only reason why they're so pretty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you have a fishy that looks like this? &gt;&gt; CLERK: Yes. Is that the guy you're looking for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yep. That's him. &gt;&gt; CLERK: You want one of those guys? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you just get like another pretty one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it needs to be the same exact one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think he knows? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney is so overprotective over Mason, which is... it's not a bad thing. I'm not saying that is, but like, for the fish, you don't have to go through this whole death story, but I don't think he's gonna really notice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, any tips on keeping it alive? &gt;&gt; CLERK: He needs a filter and a heater so you'll... a small aquarium. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, so I guess I will get a tank. So I don't have to do this again. Guys, I'm getting a tank. 241 00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,841 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I don't have to do this again. &gt;&gt; CLERK: You're also going to need to feed them every day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First Kourtney did not like that Kim and I bought Mason two fish and now Kourtney's 246 00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:39,692 buying an entire aquarium, which it-it's just a lot. Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just like Michael Jordan. Here, maybe put it on the kitchen table. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We need to plug it in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Put it here for right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Move! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, the guy said 25% to 50% water change every four weeks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay what the is wrong with this, seriously? What is this part? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That probably goes on here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it doesn't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, this is the bottom. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, excuse me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Man, this thing is so wobbly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, who the bought this piece of I wasn't given a Rubik's cube when I was younger because I had major... like I get very angry, frustrated and I throw it at things. I can't do stuff like this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hate you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, it's a present for you, okay? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yay. Look at the fishy right there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And there's one right there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is that fun? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: It says put one cap of AquaSafe... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Pow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow! Stop! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does that hurt? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, get that. Take it home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! &gt;&gt; JAY: Hi, Jay Boileau, executive vice president of Hollywood Forever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi, how are you doing? &gt;&gt; JAY: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is Bruce. &gt;&gt; JAY: Very well. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you for seeing us today. After talking to my family, I took it upon myself to research cemeteries and places that would be appropriate for a big family, and I came across one called Hollywood Forever Cemetery. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. I'm Kris. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Hi. Very nice to meet you, Kris. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How you doing? Bruce. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're the owner of this cemetery? &gt;&gt; TYLER: Yes, I am. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: It's a family business. &gt;&gt; TYLER: Yes, yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One thing about Kris, when she gets some idea up her butt, you know that she's going to do something. There's no stopping her. So to be honest with you, the easiest thing to do is just show up and get it over with. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So like, I'm looking at these pictures, and there is... Like, what is that? Like, what are the options? &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Okay, that would be a private family mausoleum; meaning that you build the structure yourself. There are also large mausoleums and within those mausoleums are what we call family rooms. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You could build your own thing? &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Build your own, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Our next building project. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: I would really focus on the Ararat Mountains for your family in Armenia. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I love that. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah, they have great meaning and also you have an Olympian here... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: So I would kind of meld everything. Hi, there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, what's up? Sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you, baby? I was thinking as a gift to you, I want to do this so that you would never have to worry about anything again if anything ever happened to me or Bruce or anybody. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: That's beautiful. &gt;&gt; TYLER: It's incredible. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. I think my mom's idea of wanting to get a family burial plot is kind of ridiculous. I mean, it's typical of my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you ever given any thought to would you want to be buried or would want to be cremated? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Above ground, below ground -- there's all sorts of options. &gt;&gt; ROB: Buried. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You want to be buried? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes, but we don't... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'm gonna make a list of all the family members. Okay, so you're buried. Okay. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's like she's planning a party. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it's exactly right. You're exactly right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you think I should be? Maybe above ground? Below or above? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Above with you, I guess, I don't know. Right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you could go underneath. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I've been there enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, that's not that exciting. I want to be on top this time. &gt;&gt; ROB: T.M.I. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, basically ladies, I want to sort of gift you guys with where we're going to end up for the rest of our lives. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know if this is a way for my mom to deal with death but it's not fun when you're like, the kid. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, another one of the fish died. This is becoming such an inconvenience. I just can't keep dealing with this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look, I was trying to play along and make it funny, but it's not funny, and it's not playful. I don't think that she's like, realized that we've already lost a parent and we don't want to think about losing another one. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: This would be an example of the community mausoleum. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. My feeling is that you could buy a whole wall, so like, we could buy that wall for 28 people and that wall for 49. I'm emotionally all in on this journey, so I'd like to do the mausoleum. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm into the mausoleum. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right? We could design 347 00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:21,140 black and white marble. &gt;&gt; KIM: Go hard or go home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khlo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You could build a mausoleum down by that water. &gt;&gt; KIM: We should really have our own mausoleum on a lake. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I like having our own lake. We want a lake. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe's into this. We got her into this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We want our own lake with a mausoleum and we want like a moat, so like, no one can steal our bodies ever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think Khloe and Kim enjoy planning the family mausoleum. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: See, we should have this and it could rise and lower when our guests come, if they know the secret password. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's actually interesting and fun doing what we're doing. Each person, if they had their own section, like this could be Khloe's section and she could go all the way up with like full burials or she could have like a hundred cremations over here. And this could be Kim and that could be Rob and then all of your... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm kind of curious just to see what the different options are and I don't know, I just feel like... why not go out and have like a fab, you know, resting place? You are ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Boo! &gt;&gt; KIM: She's like disrespecting the dead people in there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at the duck! It's coming our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my goodness. Hi, Quacker. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Quacker! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Quacker? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Here. Waddle, waddle. Come here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Waddles. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait for me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why did you wear all black? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because we're at a funeral home. 382 00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:00,573 It's respectful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Upstairs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Upstairs. Why is it the only time you call me to come over is when you need something fixed? What is this? What are you women up to? &gt;&gt; CARLA: Nothing. Chatting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nothing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Nothing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Solving the world's problems? &gt;&gt; KIM: What a bright colored shirt you have. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Were you golfing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is not proper golfing attire. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, another one of the fish died. This is becoming such an inconvenience. &gt;&gt; KIM: Again? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes! And I just can't keep dealing with this. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll get another one. I'll get more. Which one died? I'll replace it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But it needs to be exactly the same. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's not going to even know. Which one? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I'll send you a photo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, you take a photo of the dead fish. Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Of the dead fish. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What is going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: I got Mason a fish as his first pet and it keeps on dying and so he, like, doesn't know what death means, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, you could still explain it to him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not really. He can't really understand that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honestly, I think he can learn a very good lesson by saying, "You know what, the fish went to heaven," and explain it that way. There's books on the subject; kid's books about death. I mean, they're really pretty cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just should be up front with the guy. There's life, there is death, there's, you know... Fishies go to heaven. &gt;&gt; KIM: Fish go to heaven. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes. Now what do you need fixed? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I have a couple things. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello, how are you? I'm Kris. Thanks for meeting with us. I heard through a few sources that you made the most beautiful custom, custom, custom caskets in the city. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, Rob and I, we are so desperately trying to stay supportive of my mom, but it's just getting harder and harder and harder to try to support her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would like to have a black, shiny casket that looks like a baby grand piano. &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: Yes, uh huh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's shiny... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's so awkward. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...with, I think, white mother-of-pearl trim inlay, so it's black and white. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This silver one is pretty fancy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do a lot of people come and pick out their caskets for themselves? &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: Yes, all the time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Really? &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: Here, let me show you how it opens. &gt;&gt; KIM: My makeup would get all over this. &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: It is better that I open it, because... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: ...because you need to know how. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, has anyone ever like... do they sit in it to get measured? Like to see if they like it? &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No one does that? &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: All caskets are standard size. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What if you're really fat? &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: These caskets fit up to six foot three inch person. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like my husband is six foot ten inches. &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: Oh, he is? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: We just need to make him a longer casket. Why don't you follow me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: And I'll show you... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Before we leave this one, is there any way we could take it for a little spin? Or a test drive? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could I lay in it? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She just said no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't lay in it to see? &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: No, you can stay inside if you want to... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I? &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: If you want to go inside. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ISABELLE: Here, he's bringing you something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. Okay. It's very pretty. &gt;&gt; MAN: Are you close enough? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I am. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Gees and Maries. Uh, Mom, be careful. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, just go slow; just go slow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't slip and die. You might actually need this thing. &gt;&gt; MAN: Stay right here. Just be comfortable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; MAN: No peeking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is fancy. This reminds me of... &gt;&gt; ROB: A Chanel purse. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is it comfortable? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This one's very comfortable, actually. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you ready to get out, Mom? &gt;&gt; ROB: Seeing my mom in the casket is just such a weird thing to look at. She's all serious. It's making me uncomfortable and I really don't want to, like, think about that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's actually very, very comfortable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know how people keep fish alive. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have to be realistic with kids and that's part of life. What happens at some point, you buy little Mase a dog, and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, that's why I won't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It dies... Well, that's not a reason. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're mad because I'm in the will to have Mason? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't get how Kourtney thinks that you're like the better aunt, when I spend more time with him. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, your paparazzi's here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM : I didn't freak too much, but it was like a ladybug. Wait, has anyone talked to Mom about her funeral plans? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's just not something I would want to plan. &gt;&gt; ROB: Do you think Mom's okay? I mean, like... it's kinda depressing. It's kinda weird. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's definitely okay. She's just a freak. &gt;&gt; KIM: She is. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, maybe there's something that she isn't telling any of us, like something wrong with her. &gt;&gt; KIM: She would be an emotional wreck. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And she would want all of us to know. You know how Mom is. &gt;&gt; KIM: She would want the attention. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I guess. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She would be like, "Please, come to my bedside." &gt;&gt; ROB: My Mom's intentions are obviously great; they always are. But sometimes she gets a little carried away. This is like a sad process and it's kind of just messing with our emotions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't get why someone would do this. 512 00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:29,902 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to think about any of this. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was thinking like who would take care of Mason and the baby if something ever happened to Kourtney and Scott? &gt;&gt; KIM: Probably... well, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know you have to pick somebody to be like the... &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I was going to say probably you, but you might be getting a little too old. Hopefully nothing will happen to Kourtney but I don't know. Why don't you ask her? You sure work a lot in this office. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. It's Mommy and Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mommy and Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have a little question for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: About what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We were just wondering, in case something horrible happens to you or Scott, who have you picked to be Ma... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: First of all, why are you talking about this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Because we're just being extra precautious. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, who would take care of Mason if something happens to you? Which one of us is his guardian? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, it's none of anyone's business. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, yeah, because what... you would have to ask if... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Actually it is. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...we wanted that responsibility. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe the person who will have the responsibility I've asked them, which means it ain't either of you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just tell us who it is, Kourtney. This is a family decision. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's Khloe and it's not a family decision, it's my decision, it's who I think is the best in that situation. It's something I take very seriously. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't really understand why Kourtney made that decision and didn't even talk to me about it. When Mason was first born, I was watching him and I babysit him all the time. I think I'm a little taken back by it and I'm a little hurt that Kourtney doesn't look at me that way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have it all planned out. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't really care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, where are you going? Kim? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello, Brucey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How ya doing, babe? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've been organizing the baby stuff. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You think it's gonna be more fun with a little girl? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's more challenging because, like, there's so many girl styles. Like which direction do you go... like, princess tutu? Or do you go, like, boho chic? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I'm going boho chic but Kim and Khloe keep buying me tutus. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, Speaking of Kim and Khloe? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I keep hearing all this stuff about some goldfish. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They bought fish for Mase without even asking me. The fish died, so then we had to go buy another fish. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you worried about the effects it will have on poor little Mason when these fish die? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, we had to go replace and get the exact same fish. I don't know how people keep fish alive. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have to be realistic with kids. And that's part of life. What happens at some point, you buy little Mase a dog and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, that's why I won't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It dies. Well, that's not a reason. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but that's traumatizing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, I brought something that might be able to help that. Dog Heaven. Animals live and animals die and they go to heaven. It's part of educating. Okay, the fish died, terrible, terrible tragedy. Mason will recover, and I promise two hours from now, he won't even remember the fish. But Mom, especially first-time moms, everything becomes so dramatic and big and bigger than life. How are we gonna deal with it? It's fine; the fish died. We move on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There he is. Whoa, Mase. You don't seem to be too traumatized. Give me five! I brought over some books for your Mommy to read to you. Dog Heaven. Have Mommy read that book to you. Do you like books? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, he's obsessed with books. &gt;&gt; MASON: I read the baby ones. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The baby ones? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: About you're going to be a big brother? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where's your new little sister right now? Oh, Mommy's belly. Very good. Very good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, you do not need the same color shoe literally in every style. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are one to talk. &gt;&gt; KIM: I do not have them in every style. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, you do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nope. Oh, my God. Are you a Goth stripper? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, those are stripper fun shoes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Malika bought those for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't care if the pope got these for you. Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Just give it to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: What did you do this weekend? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hung out with Lam. What did you do? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, like a good auntie, I was with Masie this 607 00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:24,997 weekend. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt told me that you're Mason's guardian. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're mad because I'm in the will to have Mason. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, all I'm saying is actions should speak louder than words. You weren't there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just sorry that one day I was with Lamar, that you were babysitting. Like, how does that make me less of a person? &gt;&gt; KIM: It doesn't. I'm just saying like, I don't get how Kourtney thinks that you're like, the better aunt when I spend more time with him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't spend more time with him. It's not like a contest. I don't think Kim should be angry at all. I understand why her feelings could be hurt, you know, if she's feeling left out, but the guardian situation was something that Kourtney is honoring me with but I think the anger, I just think is just directed in the wrong place. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why did you tell Kiki about Mason being mine? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She like, forced me to say it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's just weird that like, you would even tell her anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not like, your decision. &gt;&gt; ROB: I was like showing my friends this picture I took of Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! That one literally looks like she's deceased. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, she... My mom is really making me uneasy and this whole situation is just like not normal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, this is so cute. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Damn, coming up. What happened to the fish tank by the way? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, I decided to get rid of it because it's way too hard to take care of them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, you take care of a child. It's not that hard to take care of a fish tank. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I even talked to Bruce and he was like you know, you can't protect him from everything, and I noticed that Mason hasn't even said a word since. He hasn't mentioned them one time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He probably doesn't care. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's true. Well, luckily we don't have to worry about it this time. I used to... you know I had four mice named Eenie, Meanie, Miney and Moe? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That is so bizarre. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They were white mice with red, beady eyes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who knew that you were a mice breeder? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to watch some toons? &gt;&gt; MASON: Dance! Go! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, why did you tell Kiki about Mason being mine if something were to happen? Because now she's like, pissed. I thought that was just like a final resort and it's just weird that like, you would even tell her anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom is crazy lately with all this stuff, making us get everything in order. Which I have everything in order, but she forced me to say it, 'cause she didn't think I had it in order. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you had to say it in front of Kim? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim was there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, she's being so rude to me. She's like, "I babysit Mason more than you. You're never with him." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't mean for Kim to be mad at you. It's not like, your decision. I'm surprised that Kim has been lashing out at Khloe. I would never even think that Kim was into taking on such a responsibility. I mean, she would have no clue what to do. She has no patience. She's never home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I mean, she isn't ever home. But you know, obviously she would if anything... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't even like talking about this stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Well, Mase? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you like Koko's house? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! That's my juice. &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm going to drink it all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No way, Jose. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you believe Mom sent all these flowers over here because she wanted to know which one we liked the most for whenever it's that time of day, year, life, I have no idea. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't really like talking about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't either. I feel like this is getting way too weird, and it's kind of disgusting. &gt;&gt; ROB: I was like showing my friends this picture, look. That one I took of Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! &gt;&gt; ROB: It's so weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not that one. That one literally looks like she's deceased. &gt;&gt; ROB: She... yeah. My mom is really taking the whole, like, her passing away thing and setting up her funeral, like, to another level where it's making me uneasy and this whole situation is just, like... just not normal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was trying to play along and make it funny, but it's not funny. &gt;&gt; ROB: We just are, like, really bothered. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, enough. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like you are all about Kim right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just really hurtful to what Kourtney really feels about me. Whatever. So rude. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Cheers, guys. I love having a mother who's an alcoholic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, I'm having a drink and she's having a drink but I'm the alcoholic? &gt;&gt; ROB: She's drinking a glass of champagne with strawberry. And you're drinking vodka. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because vodka doesn't have as many calories. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, we've all kind of been talking, especially like Rob and I, and we really, really appreciate everything that you're doing and, you know, that you want everything handled, but I think you have to pay attention to the uncomfortablity that it might cause your children. Like, I was trying to play along and make it funny, but it's not funny and it's not playful and that coffin place was so just like overboard. I don't think she's like realizing we've already lost a parent and we don't want to think about losing another one. It's a scary thing to think about. &gt;&gt; ROB: We're just... we just are just like really bothered, but it's because we love you, so just wanted to let you know that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I don't want you to be upset by it, for sure. It's just an important thing I need to do, like a check off my list and... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Exactly, but it's something that you need to do. Okay? Rob took this picture of you and it looks how you would look if you were really deceased. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow. That's a little frightening. I apologize. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's just like pretty disturbing when I like look at those kind of pictures of yourself and it's kind of odd that you would kind of surround us around those type of things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to enjoy you here and now. I want to live in the now and not in the 20 years from now. Like, enough. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Five little monkeys jumping on the bed. One fell off and bumped his head. I like that song. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, you are having too much fun. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoa. Okay, put on your leopard hat and then let's go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh my gosh, so many things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've been organizing the clothes into sizes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? But what do you think she should wear home from the hospital? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have these little booties and hat. &gt;&gt; KIM: So cute. Do you feel like babysitting tomorrow? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do I feel like it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have to go to our friend's birthday dinner. It's JJ's birthday. &gt;&gt; KIM: What happened to your go-to guardian? She's not available? She's too busy with Lamar? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She is, actually. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't get it. Like, if she's always busy with Lamar, and she's like possibly not even gonna be here because she's like consumed, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just... &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, why would you just not even have a conversation with me about it? Like, all I wanted was the respect of a conversation. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just feel like it's the best decision because right now you're so busy. You're always traveling and I feel like Khloe, she makes dinner every night, and it's just more like... &gt;&gt; KIM: I have dinner every night. Everyone has dinner every night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are all about Kim right now. It's not like about coming over and hanging out, taking a picture so you can Instagram or Twitpic it... like, it's about quality time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, you think I come over here because I want to Instagram a picture of Mason? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just saying that's all you do when you do spend time. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's so pathetic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not saying that's why you come here. I'm saying, it's when you're here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, I babysit him because I want to spend time with him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I Instagram and do fun things no matter what I'm doing. Yeah, I don't have kids right now, but if certain circumstances happen, you obviously adjust to that, but the fact that she says I'm all about myself, it's just really hurtful to hear what Kourtney 774 00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:28,773 really feels about me. Whatever. You're so rude. &gt;&gt; KIM: How funny that, you know... &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...that Mom used to live there growing up. She got a ton of mail there the other day... &gt;&gt; ROB: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...from like 15 years ago and they brought it over. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then see all those trees? I bought a ton of trees and they're just gonna get higher. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but you're about to move. &gt;&gt; KIM: If it's worth it. But if not, I mean, I'm totally fine here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're a hard girl to track down. Hello, Bob. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just wanted to say obviously I think you're an amazing aunt to Mason. You know, I wasn't trying to hurt your feelings with this whole thing, but like you need to pick one person. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I mean, but I also feel like I spent so much time bonding with him and it's annoying to me that you wouldn't like have a conversation with me because obviously I'm gonna find out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, maybe I should have talked to everyone first and, you know, figured it out, but, you know, we're in a meeting, had to make the decision and that's what we came up with. But, that doesn't mean that I don't think that you're not a great aunt. And I know Mason loves hanging out with you. I mean, you guys take pictures together. &gt;&gt; KIM: He likes our videos. He plays them back over and over. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys make videos, you guys read books, you watch movies. &gt;&gt; KIM: We play football. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim is a great aunt to Mason and she is very loving. She is always willing to come over at any time and I know that no matter what, her and Khloe will always be a huge part in my children's lives and hopefully I will never have to have either of them be the guardian of my children. The responsibility that I was going to give to you was the money aspect of things because I know that you're great at that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I mean, that makes sense. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want the financial responsibility? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I'm fine with it. I can easily take it on. It's not a big deal for me. It's definitely comforting to know that Kourtney trusts me with managing her finances so at least I feel included and I know I would make the right decisions in that area. As Mason would say, "Chips me." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Chips. &gt;&gt; ROB: God forbids this happens, but if, you know, everyone dies or if you guys die than I'll just, you know, look after little Mason. So, it will all work out in the end. Don't worry. ♫ ♫ WOMAN: She likes it, right? &gt;&gt; ROB: Tonight we're going to this winery in Malibu to celebrate and kind of appreciate my mom, and, you know, invited a couple of her friends, Noelle and Liz. We're supposed to be celebrating her life and not her death. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow, this is crazy. Oh, Rob. Rob, this place is rocking. How did you find this place? This is so gorgeous. Ah ha ha! I'm so excited you guys are here. This is so cute of you, Rob. Honest to God, this is the sweetest thing. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, you wanted to like celebrate your burial with like cotton candy. Like, you're crazy. Celebrate with wine and enjoy this. You understand? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like your style. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, it's your style. I'm just trying to help you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like that about you. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is like your favorite place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love this place. I mean, honest to goodness, this is like a little piece of heaven. &gt;&gt; ROB: It really is. Did you see this? Did you see my new tattoo? &gt;&gt; LIZ: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I never have worn one. &gt;&gt; ROB: Of you... it's of you. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Wait, let me see. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Robert! &gt;&gt; ROB: I got a tattoo of my mom because, you know, I have a portrait of my father and, you know, I also want a portrait of my mother. My mom's a pretty woman. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's actually... &gt;&gt; WOMAN: That's amazing! &gt;&gt; ROB: It's from her, from her wedding day. She was like putting makeup on, I thought it... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is it real? &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, you look so young, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What made you do that? &gt;&gt; ROB: Just sheer appreciation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sheer appreciation? &gt;&gt; ROB: I love it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that Rob getting this tattoo is very, very sweet. Maybe a little crazy, but sweet nevertheless. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, are you happy to like actually enjoy your life in the moment in what we're living in and stop focusing on your funeral and like worrying your whole family about... &gt;&gt; KRIS: After being here and an afternoon like this, um, I'd say I'm living in the moment. So, thanks, Rob, for bringing me back to reality. &gt;&gt; ROB: Back to reality. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; ROB: I love you, too. Next on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians": &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oprah's coming to our house. &gt;&gt; KRIS and OPRAH: Hi! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If I sweat on Oprah, I'm gonna just die. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How long until your mom cries, you think? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna cry. 873 00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:39,393 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got her to cry! &gt;&gt; ROB: Kim only cares about herself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're not acharity case. Get a job! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't even wanna be a part of this.
