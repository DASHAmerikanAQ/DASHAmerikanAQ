- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KIM: What's going on with you and French? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I kicked him out of the house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: French and I have decided to take a break. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When was that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was last night. I really just want to be responsible for me and my life and, you know, I don't know what tomorrow brings. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm on my way to the doctor with your sister. It's an urgent matter. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye and I have been trying to have a baby now for almost a year, and there's something wrong. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She has to have surgery. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They won't know until they have the surgery if she can have another baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you. &gt;&gt; NURSE: You did beautifully, Kim. I'm gonna put a little blood pressure clip on your arm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She feels warm enough. You're gonna be okay. &gt;&gt; HUANG: So when we go inside, we want to see the opening on this side, that's here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; HUANG: I cleaned all that out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What was that? &gt;&gt; HUANG: That might be old placenta, and then at the end of it you have a nice, clear cavity. Okay, all right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow. With this clean, she should be able to get pregnant on her own. &gt;&gt; HUANG: I'm very optimistic. Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Great. &gt;&gt; HUANG: Actually, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put her on some hormones. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I have some? Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; HUANG: You're fine. And then that'll get us to her next cycle. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, good. Maybe she'll move out by then so I don't have to go through yet another menstrual cycle with her. To hear that Kim's surgery is a success is everything to me. The fact that everything looks great and she's going to heal is music to my ears. &gt;&gt; HUANG: Hello? Hey! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; HUANG: Go home and get some rest, okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think that I will have a hard time getting pregnant? &gt;&gt; HUANG: I hope not. I'm very pleased with how you did. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; HUANG: Okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: The fact that the doctor is saying that this went well is amazing. There's nothing more on this earth that I would want than to be pregnant again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Scott. What's going on? Is Kylie here yet? She's meeting us here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hold on. Um, I'm gonna call you in a little. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let me text Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie isn't coming. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, isn't this Kylie's idea? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is Kylie not coming? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause she said she's on a strike because you and her got into a fight and she's not talking to you right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, please. Every time she gets mad at somebody, she just punishes them by not showing up. I've been having such a tough time connecting with Kylie, and we seem to be butting heads at every single turn. I try to spend time with each one of my kids individually and my grandkids. And lately, Kylie's been making that really tough. Okay, Scott, let's do this. &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; MAN: Green flag means, uh, race is starting. Checkered flag means race is finished. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why can't we go faster? Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was fun. Thanks, guys. This looks good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like Kylie would've had so much fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I don't know if it's, like, her age, and she's just acting out or... Everybody's had this rough patch at 17, 18. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I had my rough patch at 30. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. How you doing, bud? I'm glad you came out. Is it hard to put that down? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, you don't have much service here, so it's not that hard. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, thank God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So what's going on? Talk to me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Nothing major. I just wanted to hang out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, all right. Social life? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's all right right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And how is Kim doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kim's good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mom-- how's she doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why not? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I haven't talked to her in two weeks. I was supposed to go go-carting, then I really wanted to hang out with you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would've taken the go-carting. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't really care, to be honest. I legit don't care. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, moms and daughters at this age sometimes can be very difficult. I mean, if you ever want to talk about any of that stuff... Duh. Right here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If there's anything I can do to cheer you up or keep you on a positive note... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All righty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...here I am. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: K.K. When I say dramatic... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You know, I just didn't want to be in the middle of this awkward situation, so I literally kind of dropped the car off and threw the keys and, like, left. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. French and I have been broken up for, I mean, a little bit now, and I still have some of his belongings. Honestly, I don't want to deal with it. So I had Malika drop off all of his stuff. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm, like, in the car with Sydney, I'm like, "We need to go." 'Cause I could hear his voice. She goes, "Is that French?" And I go, "Yeah, and do you know what kind of conversation I'm gonna have to have with him?" It was just, I panicked, but I was happy to get out of there. Having to drop off French's stuff at his house was probably the most awkward thing I have ever done. I do not want to be in the middle of someone else's relationship. It just became a situation that was uncomfortable for everybody. I'm actually really happy it's done. Well, I mean... Do you feel a little relieved? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm fine. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You're single again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm single. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: We can play together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That sounds weird. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: With other people. What do you want to do? We should do something fun. Are you up for it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like what? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I would love to go on an adventure. Like, as long as we just get out, we've never done it, and we're together, we'll... It'll be, we'll make our life fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Nori baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's Nori's? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does anyone know what that white cat is up there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She got that in Thailand. &gt;&gt; KIM: In Thailand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, kitty. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna show that to North. She's obsessed with kitties. I got to read you an e-mail-- how scary this thing is that I'm speaking at. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is this? &gt;&gt; KIM: There's a tech conference called Code/Mobile. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you in the tech world? Oh, I guess you have a video game. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Is Kim Kardashian-West a mobile genius?" "Why would I want to interview her when I have had people like Apple's Steve Jobs onstage? Had I jumped the shark?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She mean the ship? &gt;&gt; KIM: It says shark. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would you even be on a shark? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe you were riding a shark. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's riding a shark? You ride a wave, you ride a ship. Who wants to even be on a shark? What if they ask you questions that you have no idea what the answers are? &gt;&gt; KIM: I met with, like, their whole app team and I did a Q and A, and it went pretty well. The tech world is a new world for me and is a new business venture, something that I've just gotten into, but I know what I'm talking about. I think the tech world is a really prestigious industry to be a part of, and since I really don't come from that world, there are a lot of people that are skeptical. This is kind of setting me up, I feel like, for failure. It's like one of those. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't say that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sure people are expecting me to come there and have no clue what I'm talking about and just want me to fail. I like to prove people wrong. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom told me, "Back out. They're trying to set you up." Well, I don't back out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get it, Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, babe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I'm on the golf course all by my little lonesome, smacking balls away. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I wanted to call you because, uh, the other day I had Kylie out. We were talking, you know, about stuff and life, but she also said that she was upset with you and not talking to you. Is that true? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, more or less. We're definitely going through a rough patch. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just think she's going through some teenage growing pains, and I have rules, and she gets angry, and so we go round and round. Lately, with Kylie, I feel completely disconnected, and when I feel like that, I'm not myself until I fix it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What can I do to help? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think there is anything that you can do to help, but I'm thinking about planning a little trip somewhere, like a mother-daughter thing that she really can't say no to. So I'm just trying to figure out what that is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think that would be perfect. Let's just keep in communication on this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, hold on one second. Robert designed some Valentine's Day socks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think it would be wrong if I sent a pair of socks that said "my boyfriend" to Keanu Reeves? Never mind. You're probably the wrong person to ask. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I wish you best of luck with that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Cheers to new beginnings. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cheers. Longevity, life and that we don't crash. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Yay! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I would've left that part out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have an appearance in Vegas, and I decided to make this an all-girls trip. I just want to let my hair down and have fun. We are gonna live it up and have the best 24 hours of our lives. We have dinner at 10:00 at a restaurant called STACK. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Oh, that's lovely. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guess who booked a party on the same night in the same city. &gt;&gt; KRISTEEN: Hmm, I wonder who. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: The French Manicure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He called me today and was like, "What are you guys doing? Come to the strip club." 'Cause we're cool. Like, it's fine. Listen, we're not gonna be turned away, so if we feel like going, we could go. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I am beyond confused. I had no idea that she was talking to him again. But he won't stay away. I have been hoping not to run into him, because I don't like confrontation, and it's a girls' trip. I don't want it to be ruined by Khloe's ex. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Vegas, here we come. Come on, Malika. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Come on, lady. Minibar is open, ladies! What are we drinking? No BS. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: What? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: When we were on the plane, did you and Khloe not say that you guys wanted to go to the strip club? &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Generally speaking, yes, we would all have fun at a strip club. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Why would we even somewhat have a plan to go to his party? &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: I was just saying it would be fun. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I don't care to be around him. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: But are you gonna be, like, in a bad mood because of that? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm not gonna be in a bad mood. Am I gonna want to hang out with him? &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: No, and nobody's gonna ask you to do that. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You're not familiar. When he comes around, he sticks around. That's how she can't get rid of his ass now. You know why? 'Cause he goes, "Leek, let me talk to you. Man, you supposed to be my sister, Leek. You, what..." I don't want to do all that. That puts me in a bad mood. So I don't want to sit at Khloe's table with him, and I definitely don't want to go to his party, either. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Oh, hey! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What time is it? &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: 8:00. Are we going to the strip club? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's, like, after hours. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: She asked me where we're going 'cause we said it on the plane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If that's something you want to do. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: If you guys want to go, obviously I don't mind if you guys go. I just wouldn't go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: French doesn't... Like, if he shows up, is it gonna put you in this horrible mood, 'cause you shouldn't let anybody... &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Same thing I asked. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's not gonna put me in a bad mood. I didn't fly here for French. I came here for Khloe. Whether he shows up or not, I don't have intentions of letting him ruin my night or anyone else's. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really don't get why Malika is so, like, bothered. I'm the one who broke up with French. If I am not tripping out on French, if I am okay with seeing him, then you should be fine. Like, what are you so bothered for? I just don't want to be, like, stressed out, like, "Oh, is this gonna, like, is this gonna ruin her mood?" Like, you don't care, like, how you're like, "I just don't even care to talk about it." It's like, if no one cares to talk about it, just let the night go. Like, he shouldn't control how anybody feels in Vegas. We're here to have fun. Is my vagina gonna come out? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, your vagina's high. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am wearing underwear, but how am I gonna do this? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, oh, go, go. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: I'm having, like, malfunctions here. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Suck in, don't breathe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. French is here. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: You're joking, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: French is right there. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Of course he is. Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: He doesn't feel, like, weird to be sitting at a table next to yours? Like, it's so random. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Zachy! Hi, Zoey. &gt;&gt; FRENCH: Malika, um... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: French. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't understand what's happening. &gt;&gt; ZOEY: He wants to talk to Malika. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What am I gonna do in San Diego by myself? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is our girls' trip; we're having a slumber party. It's been two weeks since Kylie and I have had a real, true conversation. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Follow me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I'm a little nervous, but I'm also excited. She's gonna ask me the tough questions. She doesn't really beat around the bush. &gt;&gt; KARA: Why do people not take you seriously? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, he's here. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: You're joking, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: French is right there. Zach! &gt;&gt; ZACH: What up, Malika? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Zachy! Hi, Zoey. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hey, Zoey. &gt;&gt; FRENCH: What's up? Give me ahug. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Malika doesn't want you to sit here. &gt;&gt; FRENCH: Malika, um... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: French. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't understand what's happening. &gt;&gt; ZOEY: He wants to talk to Malika. &gt;&gt; FRENCH: You know that's my heart, right? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; FRENCH: I don't know what I did to you. It's like, if you giving her that vibe like you mad at me, then she start doing other things, this and that, making me feel like, "Oh, Malika's making her do it." &gt;&gt; MALIKA: See, that's the thing, like, it doesn't have anything to do with me. Exactly what I've been trying to avoid is now happening. Whatever happens between y'all is between y'all. It's been real. I do not want to be in the middle. I'm stepping out of this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What happened? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: He was just basically saying, like, I'm the reason why you and him are not together. When you break up with someone, you do not hang out with them. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How Malika's acting right now, it's crazy. It's ridiculous that she wants me to just cut French out of my life completely. That's just not my style. My entire life, I've never done anything like that, so why would I do it now just to make Malika more comfortable? &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: But anyway, let's have fun. &gt;&gt; JEN: To Khloe! &gt;&gt; GROUP: To Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you, girls. &gt;&gt; KARA: Our little podcaster, Noah, is over here. Can you give him a few minutes? If you can't, don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sure. Yeah. I'm in San Francisco, backstage at the tech conference doing a pre-interview before I go onstage. &gt;&gt; NOAH: If you could give any bit of advice to a young woman listening, uh, what would be the first thing that comes to mind? &gt;&gt; KIM: Work hard, 'cause nothing really comes easy, even if it seems like it does, and whatever you're doing, just make sure that it's authentic. &gt;&gt; KARA: It's both a techy audience and it's also one that, um, it's really super interested in mobile. So we'll talk a little bit about the game. What are you doing differently, and why are you successful? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know that she's gonna ask me the tough questions, and I know that she doesn't beat around the bush. I'm a little nervous, but I'm prepared. &gt;&gt; KARA: Okay? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll try. &gt;&gt; KARA: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Best that I can. &gt;&gt; KARA: Best you can, good. Then just have a lot of fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have something to tell you that's very important. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you have a panini maker? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I don't, Mother. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I make the best paninis, and you need to know how to do this for you and your family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Party of one. Oh, Normy-Norm... and Kylie-Ky! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's Norman's middle name? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wimpleton. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Norman Wimpleton?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's been two weeks since Kylie and I have had a real, true conversation. And it's heartbreaking to me. Kylie, I'm going down to MJ's to spend one night, and I think that you should come with me so that we can spend a little bit of time together and have a little bonding moment. So, I want to take her someplace close so we can have a little road trip because it eliminates all the distractions so that we can get back to normal. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, that two-hour drive really doesn't get me excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, I need you to come and be with me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is Norman going, too? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Norman can come. And we can talk about all the things that you never have time to talk to me about-- remember? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at him! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, I'll think about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm your mom, and I'm telling you now that I want you to go with me to San Diego and you don't have a choice. So, pack your bags, and we're gonna leave tomorrow. Be ready at 10:00. &gt;&gt; KARA: When we announced that we were gonna have Kim Kardashian, we got a lot of interesting reaction on Twitter. Why do people not take you seriously? &gt;&gt; KIM: Perfect first question. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Malika has been acting incredibly distant towards me. I still really want to make an effort to go on this single girls road trip. Road trip! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I admire that Khloe is putting effort towards us. I just want to address our situation, and let's just get through it. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: We're about ready for you to be backstage. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Follow me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KARA: When we announced that we were gonna have Kim Kardashian, we got a lot of interesting reaction on Twitter. &gt;&gt; KIM: As a businesswoman, it's really exciting to kind of venture off and do something different from the world I come from. I have never been to a tech conference like this. I'm a little nervous, but I'm also excited. &gt;&gt; KARA: So, let's start by talking about why do people not take you seriously? I mean... &gt;&gt; KIM: Perfect first question. &gt;&gt; KARA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I don't know. I pride myself in my work ethic, and I work really hard. &gt;&gt; KARA: One of the things I think is interesting with you is that... you use social media. You seem to be bypassing media to go right to your fans. Talk about that. Like, why...? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I love that connection. I could be jet-lagged across the world and write something on Twitter, and feel like there were people that I can communicate with. And I would write back to so many people, and that was fascinating to me that you can just connect with people across the world... &gt;&gt; KARA: Why did you like Twitter? What was the...? What was the...? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's an amazing focus group. &gt;&gt; KARA: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would ask people, "What color fragrance bottle should I use-- this shade of pink or this shade of pink?" And I would twit-pic a photo and I would get a response back and it was fascinating to me. And I would use that information... &gt;&gt; KARA: The game. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KARA: What did you, what did you do for them? Besides lend your name? &gt;&gt; KIM: The comp... Well, it-it wasn't just that. I mean, I must've spent weeks getting what I wanted all of the clothing to look like and the characters-- they took such amazing direction on that. &gt;&gt; KARA: What do you imagine doing next in mobile? &gt;&gt; KIM: Everything is moving into mobile, whether it's, you know, I have clothing stores... &gt;&gt; KARA: Commerce? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KARA: You could see yourself doing mobile commerce... &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely. It's really fun and exciting to see all of these things come to life when you work really hard at it. &gt;&gt; INA: Oh, high five! &gt;&gt; KIM: How was it? &gt;&gt; INA: I think it went really well. &gt;&gt; KIM: Someone Instagrammed a photo of me there and said, "Kim is an eloquent, thoughtful speaker and a hell of a businesswoman; inspiring talk from her at Code/Mobile." &gt;&gt; INA: Yay! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just really glad that it went well. It was, like, a 50/50 shot. I could've either gone out there, bombed this interview or get people to respect a little bit more of the business side that I love so much. You can grow from an experience of maybe not being so comfortable. &gt;&gt; INA: Kara said, "It went great. People here loved her. I think people were surprised with the level of savvy." &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, that's so good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This we can hang, put away in the thing. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna bring these two. Malika has been acting incredibly distant towards me. And that has never happened in our friendship ever. So I rented such a cute, fun, pink Thunderbird. This will be sick. Because Vegas didn't go so well, and I still really want to make an effort to go on this single girls road trip and have fun and kind of brush everything under the rug and let's move on! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Let's run like the wind. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Road trip! We're cruising for a bruising! I'm going over, buddy. We're on the freeway... There's someone next to me! Listen, people, the brakes don't work on this car, okay? Don'twith me! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I admire the fact that Khloe is putting effort towards us getting back to a good place, but I'm not used to being upset with Khloe, and it hurts. But I'm gonna try to put my best foot forward and just see what she has planned for us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I already have to pee. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't this pretty, Kylie? When was the last time you were in La Jolla? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Was I ever in La Jolla? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You used to come down here all the time when you were a little girl. Our meeting tomorrow is at 2:30. Pretty Little Liars. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I swear. She was gonna send scripts over. Everyone loves your style. They're obsessed with you. My thought is you can use your social media and do those little vignettes about style. It's like I've been asking you to do this for one year and you could've been well on your way. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My mom is always on my case about this or that, and if we're gonna take a trip together, I just want to talk about other things than work. What am I gonna do in San Diego by myself? I might as well take... &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is our girls trip! We're having a slumber party. We can turn on a movie. And order some crazy sweets from room service. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This way. &gt;&gt; MAN: Welcome back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; MAN: Doing good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nice to see you. Wait, look what we got. We have a bed for Norman. And look at this view, Kyles. What do you think? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, I need my own room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The whole point of the trip was so that we can bond. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I can't. No slumber party. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Slumber party. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can wear onesies. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I can't do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The fact that she wants her own room wouldn't seem like such a big deal, but I was really looking forward to laying in bed in our pajamas and watching movies and hanging out and just... being together. Hi. Yes. This is Kris Jenner. I was just wondering if you guys happen to have one more room available. But, as she has proven in the past, if I push too hard, she will leave. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to go there! How often do you drive by an entire field of miniature ponies? Look at the little ponies! &gt;&gt; MJ: Are you gonna have a new place pretty soon? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I think I'm gonna start looking, like, this week. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't realize that she was in this big of a hurry to move out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, wait for Mommy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't like this. Why are we walking? How far is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a block that way. You're gonna survive. Except don't walk too fast because my shoe will come off. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, you shouldn't have worn heels if you can't handle it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. I can handle a block or two. Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Grandma, this is Norman. &gt;&gt; MJ: Well, hello, Norman. You're like a stranger. The Official Princess Rulebook. Oh, here, Kylie, this one's for you. &gt;&gt; MJ: This is for you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm a queen, but thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you're a princess for now. You can grow into a queen. See those little blue check Humpty Dumpty's? Those were in Khloe's room when she was a baby. &gt;&gt; MJ: Yeah, and there's a picture of her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I took that picture. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Aw. &gt;&gt; MJ: Do you go see your sister very often? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Which one? &gt;&gt; MJ: Kendall. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She's out of town a lot. &gt;&gt; MJ: When she's there, do you visit her new place? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, we hang out. &gt;&gt; MJ: I bet it's fun. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We get down. &gt;&gt; MJ: Are you gonna have a new place pretty soon? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I think I want to start looking, like, this week. &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: The second I turn 18, on my 18th birthday, I'll be all moved in and ready to live in my house. &gt;&gt; MJ: Wow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie is gonna be 18 before you know it. I just didn't realize that she was in this big of a hurry to move out. I almost feel offended that she's counting the days and the hours, and she just wants to get away from me. &gt;&gt; MJ: Do you know when I had my own place? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How old? &gt;&gt; MJ: Guess. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When you got married. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 17. &gt;&gt; MJ: 16. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You had your own place? &gt;&gt; MJ: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When you were 16? &gt;&gt; MJ: Mm-hmm. My girlfriend and I talked my mother into letting me move into an apartment with her, 'cause she was older. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: We're literally, like, in the countryside. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like it. It's so cute. We are in the cutest town called Solvang. It's a Danish town. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: These homes are like cottages. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so, so cute. Look at that windmill. How cute. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! Look! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We drive by a miniature pony farm. Aw! I want to go there! One of the best parts about going on a road trip is if you see something cool, you pull over and you go and explore that. How often do you drive by an entire field of miniature ponies? Look at the little ponies. Hi. &gt;&gt; JOLEIGH: Hi. Welcome. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this your place? &gt;&gt; JOLEIGH: This is my place. Rema! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, look. &gt;&gt; JOLEIGH: Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're like little puppies. I thought I saw one with a saddle on it. &gt;&gt; JOLEIGH: Oh, he probably had this one hooked up with a harness. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, got it. That's what it was. &gt;&gt; JOLEIGH: Do you want a ride? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure. &gt;&gt; JOLEIGH: All right, hop on in. Jose's a good driver, I promise. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Jose. &gt;&gt; JOSE: Hi. You want to go fast? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure. Oh, yeah! Good girl. Malika, look! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Are you guiding her? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He let me steer her. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to do it? It's so cute. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you, little pony. You're over it? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I mean, I felt like you had a little bit of a plan. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just think we should just, like, enjoy. We're already here. Let's, like, take our time. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Although Khloe and I are best friends, I understand she deals with situations by kind of sweeping things under the rug. I'm not able to do that. I wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm very emotional. And at this moment, I just want to address our situation and let's just get through it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing with all the candy? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm going back in my room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, I feel sometimes like nothing's ever good enough. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It breaks my heart that she wants to leave, and I feel like she doesn't want to be with me. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I don't know how to be, like, in an awkward phase with you. When it comes to men, it's been very difficult for me to watch her. I didn't want to feel like someone could come in between our relationship. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you let someone do that. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Because you thought it was okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you sleeping? Wake her up, Norm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, this is crazy. It's 6:00. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: If we're not going to dinner, I can't sit here from, like, 6:00 to 3:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: MJ gave me a pill, and it put me to sleep. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, excuses. Like I predicted, my mom is practically passed out. I knew this trip was gonna end up like this. I'm just gonna hang out by myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing with all the candy? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm taking what's mine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean, you're taking what's yours? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm going back in my room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, I went to a lot of trouble to try to get some nice quality bonding time in today, but sometimes I feel like nothing's ever good enough. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It breaks my heart that she wants to leave, and I feel like she doesn't want to be with me, and it's driving me crazy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm gonna go to my room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: One day you're gonna regret not spending time to enjoy what's going on around you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, maybe I agree with you, but I just need to decide for myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And you're always on your phone. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! What a cute place. &gt;&gt; JAMI: Would you guys like to do a wine tasting? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow. &gt;&gt; JAMI: We have GoGi label. That's Kurt Russell's label. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love Kurt Russell. &gt;&gt; JAMI: Well, I hope you love Kurt Russell, 'cause he's my brother. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He is?! &gt;&gt; JAMI: Yes. Okay, the Goldie Chardonnay. And what did you decide on? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm gonna have Angelbaby. &gt;&gt; JAMI: Ah! Kurt does the blend himself on this. He's very hands-on making this wine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are so cute. &gt;&gt; JAMI: Now you two must cheer one another. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, we must. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: So... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Um... Even I'm... I'll be honest with you. Even being here was, like, tough for me, because I don't know how to be, like, in an awkward phase with you. I don't claim to know the best relationship that Khloe should be in, but when it comes to men, it's been very difficult for me to watch her engage and break up in relationships. So I've become very protective of her. I mean the best, and it all comes from a very loving place, so this is hard for me. I didn't want to feel like someone could come in between our relationship. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you let someone do that. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Because you thought it was okay. &gt;&gt; MJ: I was so glad that you guys came down and I got to see Kylie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. I'm just glad Kylie came at all. She feels like she doesn't need her mommy, you know? &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, like you did at 17? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No camping. Mountain lions. You sure do pick the best locations to play. Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hurry up! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I didn't want to feel like someone could come in between our relationship. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But you let someone do that. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Because you thought it was okay. You have a disingenuine person in your life, and you're making me deal with that person. That puts me in a very awkward, like, weird-ass situ... I don't want to be in that type of situation. I shouldn't have to deal with that. He's not someone you should even be around. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, but that doesn't, that shouldn't... There are so many people I think you shouldn't be around. It's none of my... Who cares? I think Malika thinking she has my best interests at heart is great, and I respect that, and I love her for that, but her, in a way, trying to, like, discipline me because I'm not doing it her way, she has to get over that. 'Cause I'm gonna do things my way, and it's my life, and I have to experience things for myself. And I don't believe in cutting people out of my life. I still like to keep relationships intact, and she should respect that. There's many people I've chosen to not be around in your life, but I don't make it your issue. You have to experience those things for your own. I can't sit there and tell you, I hate Caitlin, I hate... You got to get rid of this Caitlin person, blah-blah-blah. And then just, and you-you're like, all right. I understand everything you're saying, but that's for me to decide, and that's my journey to walk. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Honestly, I'm not trying to make her decision for her, but if that's how she feels, I have to respect it. This is not the first breakup that I've been around for with Khloe, and I will be around for the rest of them, and I'll support her no matter what she does. I did feel like you should've dealt with us, dealt with him differently. We don't deal with everything the same. And it's fine; we can agree to disagree. I'm not trying to choose for you. I could not choose the best suitor for you-- I never have, I never will-- but I can choose for myself, and I no longer want to be affected by this individual, in this way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But why are you, like-- yes! &gt;&gt; WAITER: How is everything, guys? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good, thank you. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Good. Are you guys all finished up here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yes. &gt;&gt; WAITER: I got some fruit here for dessert, for you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't this pretty? &gt;&gt; MJ: Mm-hmm! Beautiful! I wish you were facing the view. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What medication did you give me yesterday? You knocked me out. &gt;&gt; MJ: So you slept good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did. I slept really good. &gt;&gt; MJ: Really good. I was so glad that you guys came down and I got to see Kylie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. I'm just glad Kylie came at all, because we hadn't been really speaking for a couple of weeks. &gt;&gt; MJ: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She feels, I think, sometimes, like she doesn't need her mommy, you know? &gt;&gt; MJ: Oh, like you did at 17. Remember? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; MJ: I think she has a lot of your moxie and know-how, you know that I mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Mary Jo has a pretty good point. I remember when I was Kylie's age-- I was 17 years old-- and I actually met my first husband, Robert Kardashian. So that's crazy. Payback's a bitch. &gt;&gt; MJ: What goes around comes around. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; MJ: There you are! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, boo! &gt;&gt; MJ: Kiss, kiss-- mwah! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know, I'm just full of surprises. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a bagel for you over here. Hey, Norman. &gt;&gt; MJ: Kylie... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes? &gt;&gt; MJ: I'm so glad you're spending the weekend with your mom. She needs you, you know. Mom's at that age, and you're at that age where you have to stay together, even though you're growing up. And, you know, she knows you're not still a little girl, but she just wants to have a little bonding time with you, you know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I agree. &gt;&gt; MJ: You agree? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think MJ's right; I think I've been a little tough on my mom. I'm the youngest, and I'm gonna leave the nest soon, so I should take in this quality time with my mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I actually want to take you to an amusement park that I used to go to when I was young. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Aw... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Want to go? &gt;&gt; MJ: Sure she does. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. Sounds fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it'll be fun. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: The wide-open road. Back at it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've heard about these phenomenal natural hot springs, right outside of Solvang, and it's on our drive home, and I feel like we could, maybe, put all this nasty stuff behind us and not fight anymore. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: "No camping. Mountain lions." You sure do pick the best locations to play. Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hurry up! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'm not hydrated enough for this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Come on, you guys, like, I didn't know this was happening. No, Kourtney, you did know this was happening. I'm pregnant. I cannot be in mud. What, Kourtney, you're pregnant? We're getting closer! Oh! Oh... oh...! Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is... there's no way. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: What in the is even in here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I just got some water in my mouth-- oh, my God. It smells like literal and eggs and mildew mixed together. And that one's murky white-- oh! Like, there's cream in that one! And there's bacteria, white foam, everywhere. It's so gross. We cannot end this trip this way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ugh! Oh! Ugh! Oh, my God! Ugh...! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: This is where you wanted to come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but I envisioned small, different pools and waterfalls-- I am so upset that this is why we walked up here! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Well, look, I'm gonna cop a squat... and you're going to do the same, 'cause this is your adventure. Come, come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it smells! Like, horrible! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Well, let's look at the upside: like, last night was a little intense. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: But I just wanted to make it all good. Our relationship hit, like, a tense point, and I think, as much as it's been, like, uncomfortable, I feel like it was a really good thing, like, for us to spend the time, hash it out... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Obviously, Malika and I are never gonna agree on everything, but Malika and I are going to rise above, and I just think we're bigger than that. We've been through more than this, and this is nothing. We needed the alone time, and I'm sorry for putting you in that position. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I still feel like, even though this was supposed to be, like, some cleansing experience, we still had ours. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! For sure. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: And that's really all that matters. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I literally am gonna pee-- where do you pee? I wish I had a sometimes. I do-- it'd be so much easier. And then I could just go and takepics and I could just pee wherever I want. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Thethat comes out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I'm literally going to pee on your face. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's really sweet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look! Belmont Park. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How cute! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't it great? It's like an old-fashioned wooden roller coaster. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are we wearing the same glasses? &gt;&gt; KRIS: God, I hope so. Look, let's go over here. Giant Dipper. Do you know I used to ride this when I was a little girl? There's nothing in the world that matters more to me than my children. As a mom, to have that close bond with them, is everything. It's what I live for. Oh, no... oh, no! Oh, God, please. No matter how old my kids get, my wish is that I will always have that connection and that bond with them. And I just hope that they want to have the same thing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I am so glad I got to do this with my mom. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's so much fun to come here and do what she was doing at my age. This is, like, the biggest cotton candy I've ever seen. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. So, Kylie, I know that you think I'm really hard on you... and you are the youngest, so it's the hardest, but I love you so much, and I just want you to know that I'm always gonna be here in your life and help you through the ups and the downs, and hopefully be here for all the wonderful times, too. And I think it's important for us to do stuff together once in a while so that we can bond, too, and stay connected, right? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know what that means. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That means we're stuck together forever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my baby. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Ready, then? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Aw, that's really pretty! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The photo shoot is amazing. I really couldn't be happier. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Do a lot of women hate you? &gt;&gt; KIM: There's been a lot of theft at the store, so I have set up every security camera you can imagine. &gt;&gt; MAN: We're gonna watch them steal. &gt;&gt; KIM: I see him putting something in his pocket. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; MAN: What the? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's time for you to start hosting your own parties. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe that you're doing a club appearance. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You booked me on this event, and you've been MIA all day long. What theare you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you okay?
