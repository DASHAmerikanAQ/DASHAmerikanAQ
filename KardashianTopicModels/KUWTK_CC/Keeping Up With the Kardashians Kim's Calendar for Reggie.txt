- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, that is the ugliest nail file I've ever seen. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like glass. I've never seen such a thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't handle that glass noise. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, it's pretty awkward. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know how to do my bangs. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, so you guys, I cannot believe my one-year anniversary is coming up so soon. I have no idea what to get Reggie. I don't know, like, do I get jewelry...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, what about like a nice watch or something? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why don't you get him a leopard? &gt;&gt; KIM: A leopard? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you get him... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would want a leopard, I hope someone would buy me one. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know, maybe I should do something kind of like a calendar. Like just for him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: It will have like a football look. Valentine's Day I feel like will be something cute and red. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: March you have to wear like a green... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Saint Patrick's Day. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, March is his birthday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So a birthday cake surrounding you. Sprinkles, cupcakes in a circle. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was going to say in my birthday suit. Just kidding &gt;&gt; Alright, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go on. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. Duh. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; Welcome to American Laser Centers &gt;&gt;How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: So if I'm going to do a calendar, I have to be in the best shape possible. And I work out all the time, but I have a little bit of cellulite. &gt;&gt; We have a couple of different options that you can do. We have skin tightening, we have photo facial, we have laser hair removal and then we have our VelaShape. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She needs whatever could remove the cellulite from her ass. &gt;&gt; That's the VelaShape. You'll love it. &gt;&gt; KIM: We need to start now. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It might be a long treatment. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When you have a big butt, it kind of comes along that you have cellulite and other ripples and things. Look at that. She needs to do it there. &gt;&gt; KIM: What should I do? If I have it kind of everywhere? &gt;&gt; We can do the bottom of the thigh and then like a part of your butt. &gt;&gt; KIM: So should I take these underwear off or what? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, what do you want to do, show your whole vajean? &gt;&gt; KIM: So this cellulite removal process is this big huge machine that basically gives you a massage. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just excited to watch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, that looks so weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's it feel like? &gt;&gt; KIM: It feels like someone's like, sucking on my thigh. It tickles, but it's like hot at the same time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It looks like you're having a twitch. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wish I had this twitch all the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, Kim, your thigh is so meaty. It's almost like watching a porno. You can't take your eyes off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's meeting with him tomorrow just to see what he says-- what he has to say. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you guys talking about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This guy that called Scott about, um... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A jeweled... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That wants him to work for him at this car place. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Like in a job? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A real job. What do you...? You don't have a job. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I work all the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Doing what? Playing golf. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. How do you think we have all of this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you a male prostitute? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: These girls don't think I work all the time. But you know what, I work out of the house. I do my speaking, represent companies, I'm traveling all the time. I work hard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you should go to one of Bruce's speeches where he goes and he motivates sales forces. Kourtney and Khloe don't have a clue as to what Bruce really does and speaks about when he goes out and does his motivational speeches. And I think that they could really gain a lot from listening to one of Bruce's speeches. He's giving a speech this week in Orange County. Why don't you guys go? It's nice and local. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not a funny joke. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You need to get serious about life and come to my presentation, that's all there is to it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? We own two businesses. I own two businesses. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everybody needs a little energy in their lives. A lot of people really look up to him to inspire them to be better. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to see. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, have I got you going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now I'm ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He earned the title "The World's Greatest Athlete." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. Are you coming? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and I are going to drive to Orange County and listen to Bruce speak. The only reason why we're going is because my mom is forcing us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; TROY: I'm so excited to shoot you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Me, too. I'm shooting with Troy Jensen, who is amazing. He's doing my hair, my makeup and he's the photographer. &gt;&gt; TROY: I might have them put just a bottom on you or like a skirt. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; TROY: No top and you're just doing something... Or just the top. &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie has no idea and I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; TROY: Right there, beautiful. Right like that. Right there. Yeah, just like that. Yeah, I want to see a little bit more. Exactly, right like that. Look at me. Beautiful, I love it. It can be loosened a little bit. You can loosen it a little bit. I want you to just play. &gt;&gt; KIM: Heartbreaker. &gt;&gt; TROY: Get comfortable. Right there, right there. Same thing, do a few of those. Yes, get it on your fingers. Just put like, your... a little bit in your mouth. And a little bit more to the side. I want V legs. &gt;&gt; Troy, what's the next lens? &gt;&gt; TROY: Give me a second, let me focus. &gt;&gt; KIM: &gt;&gt; Surprise! &gt;&gt; KIM: So Reggie surprises me and shows up at my shoot. I'm really excited to see him, but I kind of hope that it doesn't ruin the surprise. He thinks it's just for some other magazine. So I'm going to let him think that. &gt;&gt; TROY: And lean forward a little bit more, just like that. Don't move. Put your leg back up. Remember, bright eyes, baby eyes. Right there, don't move. Look right where you were. You got to keep your legs really close. Can you do it where you're holding your hair up? Right there, that's where I want you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie's a little uncomfortable with the sexiness of the shoot, but little does he know, the shoot is just for his eyes only. How cool does my makeup look, though? &gt;&gt; TROY: Gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KIM: &gt;&gt; TROY: And there's something about them that's so intimate. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, babe, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Just got done talking on the phone. What's up? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you upset about the photo shoot? &gt;&gt; REGGIE: I don't like how... I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's kind of cute that he's a little uncomfortable when little does he know that he has nothing to worry about. I don't know, I get... kind of tired of doing like, all of these sexy photo shoots. Especially when it's so, like, bikinis and lingerie and... &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Don't do it. I think I should get approval over all the pics. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, you'll get approval, all right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls, we got to go. Come on, let's go. Up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go wake up Kourtney. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not just another day, baby, it's another day to excel-- let's go. Get your buns up. We're burning daylight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So this morning, Bruce wakes us up and we are exhausted, we're so tired. And we can't believe he really came here to wake us up so we'd go to hear a speech. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, this is going to be a great day, girls. Going to work with step daddy day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut theup. &gt;&gt; SHIVA: Hi, Kris. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! Fine. How are you? &gt;&gt; SHIVA: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, the Dylan's candy bar looks so cute! It makes me hungry every time I look at it. &gt;&gt; SHIVA: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good, honey. What's going on? &gt;&gt; SHIVA: So this mail came for Kim. Do you know what it is? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Oh, my! 2008 calendar? Wow! She must have told me about this, but I forgot. Kim has so many projects going on now that I really have a hard time keeping it all straight. The last thing I want to do is let Kim think that I dropped the ball on something. &gt;&gt; SHIVA: She looks so cute there, look at her hair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! This is fabulous! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you wearing tomorrow? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The same suit, with the gray shirt and gray tie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is so embarrassing! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Normally, I just do the presentation, you know? But this one, I gotta do the cocktail party the evening before, and then, the next morning is the presentation. Newport Center. We're taking a right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Fashion Island! They have the best shopping! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're driving right &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're driving right Girls, here's the scoop. These are businesspeople, okay? I want you to be on your best behavior. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Someone tells me to shut up, I tell them to &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, these are, like, business people. They don't use language like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're businesspeople. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to be, like, you, youugly monster. I hate youbusiness, corporate &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. Let's go. Come on. Be on your best behavior. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I act amazing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, girls. Here we go. Hi, Russ. Nice to see you. How are you? &gt;&gt; RUSS: Very good. How you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Very good. &gt;&gt; They change it. Every month, it's at a different venue, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you guys do? &gt;&gt; I'm a CPA. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A CPA and a...? &gt;&gt; I'm in insurance. An insurance broker. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't go crazy on the hors d'oeuvres or the drinks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I agree. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need a drink. We are so bored here, so we decide to make the best of it. Trust me, this is the most entertaining part of the entire night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What up? Yo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Three, four, I declare a thumb war! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Five, six, seven, eight... Why won't you answer me? Drew, it's really hurting my feelings. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you girls doing? Girls, girls, that's not funny. Time to get out of here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We gotta go home to our hotel room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls, girls, girls, girls, come on. It's time to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You were just... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, no. It's time to go. I think it was one too many glasses of wine. When you started fondling with the mannequins, I thought, you know what? This is a little bit too much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love football players! Grr! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. If you don't have appropriate behavior, maybe you shouldn't even come in the morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: To what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To my presentation. You came all the way down here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I... This wasn't it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: These two girls can't control themself at a cocktail party. I'm concerned about how Kourtney and Khloe are going to do tomorrow at my speech. Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know you love us! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is business. This is not fooling around. This is not fun and games. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know you love us! You know you love us. &gt;&gt; Kim, I'm at the newsstand. There's a calendar with your face on it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, hang-over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My God! I'm so tired. This is so early! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's <i>so early!</i> Khloe and I are so exhausted. We just want to get this show on the road, so, Bruce, hurry it up when you're talking. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls, I told you 6:45-- it is now 7:03. I'm supposed to be there at 7:00. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, you know we're girls. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We need to be fashionably late. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you mean, girls? It's just responsible with your time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm hungover, I'm tired. The last thing I want to do is listen to the boringest man in the world. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're already late. Let's go. &gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bruce Jenner! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, I think the deal was, if I drove in in the BMW, I got to keep the BMW? Is that...? Where is the Irvine guys? Yeah. I started off as a dyslexic kid. Failed second grade. Suffered from terrible low self-esteem. What sports did is it gave me an arena to play in, to test myself, to grow as a human being. What has your business done? What the business has done is given you an arena to play in. I got my four keys to success: gamble, cheat, lie and steal. Gamble your best shot. Dare to take risks. Cheat. Cheat those who would have you be less than you are. Surround yourself with positive people, uplifting people, people who want to see you do well. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce starts his speech, and he's actually an amazing storyteller. I didn't know he could articulate himself this well, and be so into every word he's saying. I'm really impressed. Seriously think about your life-- decisions that you made in your life. You gotta make some concrete, gut-wrenching decisions about where you want to go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm dying right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm at the newsstand, and there's a calendar-- it says, "2008 Calendar," and you with your face on it, and you have your finger in your mouth. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? I don't have a calendar. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yes, you do, and you're all in lingerie. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. Where are you? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: The newsstand on Laurel. &gt;&gt; KIM: This makes no sense. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You have a birthday cake with your finger in your mouth. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! That's the one that I made for Reggie. I'm so confused. Oh, my God! I bet you Mom took my calendar. Oh, my God! I'm going to kill her. Please make sure that you buy them all. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: All of them? &gt;&gt; KIM: Buy all the calendars, and call me as soon as you're done. I'm going to call Mom. I'm going to call Mom. So my first instinct is my mom. My mom definitely has something to do with this. Hi. Liz, it's Kim. Is my mom there? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, Mom's not answering her phone. I'm going to go to the store right now. I'm going to find out where else the calendars are. This is what she does. My thoughtful gift, she tries to make, you know, money off of it. My mom could potentially ruin my anniversary present if I don't get these all back. I'm so pissed, and I'm going to literally kill her. What did you do with my calendar? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't know it was your personal calendar. I thought I was doing a really great thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where did you distribute them to? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Key, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: What did you do with my calendars? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: The calendar that I made for my boyfriend for our one-year anniversary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-oh. I had no idea I wasn't supposed to be doing this calendar project. I didn't know they were for Reggie. You had pictures delivered here that said to you. As your manager, I open any kind of a box that comes here. I don't think I did anything wrong, Kim. You're always telling me that I have these missed opportunities, and I'm not acting quick enough on anything that you do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where did you distribute them to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, right now they're down at the Laurel Park News, the Laurel Canyon Newsstand. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where else? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're at Handmade Galleries. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where else? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And that's all for right now. I thought I was doing a really great thing. And I thought I really, I mean, I was really proud of myself that I got 'em here in, like, 12 hours. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you weren't. You weren't. And you need to ask and you need to be in communication. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have no communication. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're the one who left me out of the loop, Kim. You're the one who left me out of the loop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I need to go and get all my photos. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Credit in life goes not to the critic who stands on the sideline and points out where the strong stumble, but rather, the real credit in life goes to the person who's actually<i>inthe arena.</i> And finally, always believe in the power of you. Let's make it a great year, 2008. How's that sound? Thank you very much. It was my pleasure. Great, great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He was amazing. I'm really blown away by Bruce's speech. After listening to him talk, it really makes me want to chase my dreams just like Bruce chased his. Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was really cool. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was really not as boring as I thought it was gonna &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You mean, I'm <i>not</i> boring? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I love that. No, I want to build my own center from scratch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. Kourtney, you and I, same page. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Same page! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, this is good. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. So I'm running around from store to store, newsstand, bookstores and buying every calendar back. &gt;&gt; All right, 30 of them at $14.95. $485.50. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's find news. &gt;&gt; It's gonna be $194. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously? This is so embarrassing. Hi. Rob and I got, hopefully, every single calendar. This is all my mom's fault, and somehow, I'm gonna get her back. This is costing me more money than her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She just doesn't appreciate all the work that I do for her. And it makes me just sad sometimes. I get just really down. She gets my energy down. It's, like, "Hello. What's wrong with that?" Don't have anything to say about that because you are a kid and you're sweet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I do have something to say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Your boob is really squishy. Your boob is really squishy. Your boob is really squishy! Your boob is squishy! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're, like, psycho child. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Mom. This is what I've been spending my day doing. This is something that was private for Reggie and I. Do you think people are gonna understand that March, me holding a birthday cake has anything to do with the month of March? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Robert's birthday is in March, too, Kim. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yeah, but she wouldn't have her finger in her mouth sucking cake. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I was trying to do was surprise you with what I thought was a really great idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: If one person gets this calendar besides Reggie, then my whole gift is ruined. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you have to pay $14.95 apiece? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, I did. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you ask for a group discount? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, it's not funny, okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I get that now, Kim, and I, and I'm sorry. I can't take it back. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, babe, did you get the calendar? I'm so glad that Reggie loves the calendar and I'm just so relieved that my mom didn't ruin the surprise. I got you good, didn't I? All right, call me later. I love you. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's actually a really good speaker and he's very articulate, and, like, people are, like, captivated. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's great, because nobody's captivated by what I say around here. I just want to say all you kids, I'm extremely proud of you because you all know where you're going, you all have good direction, and you all have very good work ethics. I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your speech made me want to, like, take things to the next level, like, clothing line. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe and I are really proud of Bruce, and we're actually a little bit motivated. And thanks to Mom, calendars for everyone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, this is what we need. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Put it up. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Dorm room! Dorm room! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, Kimberly! Who do you look like there? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Amy Winehouse. Doesn't she look like Amy Winehouse there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She does, I swear. I was thinking the same thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The big question, Kim, is what does Reggie think of your calendar? &gt;&gt; KIM: He loved it. It's hung up in the locker room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It should be called "The Tush," or "The Bush." The Bush and the tush. &gt;&gt; KIM: A Bush for the tush. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You tell him how Mom tried to scam you for a couple bucks? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't give me that look, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Last year, I set up a photo shoot for my mom. The pictures were kinda racy, really sexy. My mom definitely needs a dose of her own medicine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. Remember that picture, that photo that's in your closet? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, that's not really very funny. Where's the picture? &gt;&gt; KIM: $5,000 and it's all yours. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This isn't funny, Kim! &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you, Mom. Next on <i>Keeping Up With The</i> <i>Kardashians:</i> Reggie is doing this pool tournament in New Orleans. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, it's time for a romantic few days with my wife. I'm gonna get her nude and chase her around the house. &gt;&gt; This is what we have left. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're living in a FEMA trailer as big as my bedroom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They have, like, nothing.
