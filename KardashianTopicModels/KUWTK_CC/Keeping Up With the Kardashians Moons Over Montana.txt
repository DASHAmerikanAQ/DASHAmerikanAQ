- &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh! My boobs are getting bigger. It's a problem. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's so cool. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, they, like, hurt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what happens when your body grows. You get, like, growing pains. Do you not want big boobs? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. They go in and out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe hormones. I don't know. Want to go upstairs? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ow. Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would you do such a thing? Uh... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Is this, like, a Jenner thing? Like, our boobs are really low on our body? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I think it's me. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Do you have big... a big chest? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I do. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: See how my boobs look really low? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you could look at it like you have more room for diamonds. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, you know, it's a positive. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, that's so brave of Kylie to be doing singing lessons. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Isn't it cute? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall and I are gonna do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She started singing a few notes one day at the house, and she sounded amazing. She did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You never say I sound amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, she sounded, like, really amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all, I've definitely been known that I'm, like, the real deal. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, I've definitely been known. Like, I've had some singers tell me that I'm, like, an amazing singer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When have you sang in front of singers? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: A lot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you guys form a girl band? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We should. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We'd be taken so seriously. (Kendall and Khloe sing high notes) &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Supermodel work. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, you're so chic and sophisticated. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait. Don't seem so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who invited you here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I was about to wear my beanie, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Copycat. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Anyway, so I had a dream, literally, the entire night, like, every... I kept waking up and going, "Aah! Kourtney!" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And I was really, really, really scared. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The one thing, I think, in this family is that we're all really busy, and it's hard to even think about the things that are happening in our lives. I find it to be helpful sometimes to go to therapy. There's been so many changes this year with my mom and Bruce. And now that everything going on with Bruce is out in the open, with our family, we all want to make sure that Kendall and Kylie feel supported and have an outlet to communicate their feelings. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: If you're talking about therapy... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: ...I don't see it as the worst thing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't think you should ever go to therapy unless you're the one asking for it. I don't know. I feel like I go through these times where, like, I hate my life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you think you're willing to go, or not willing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I probably won't. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's pretty crazy that all of this information about my dad is coming out, and with our parents splitting up, Kylie and I are handling it differently. Kylie does bottle up her emotions, and it's just easier for me to open up. But being able to work all the time and travel kind of keeps my mind off of it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye. Love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Guess that's it. Love you, toots. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Want to see what Mom dropped off? &gt;&gt; KIM: What is it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE:Exactly. &gt;&gt; KIM: These have to be, like, Dad's or something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They don't even work. &gt;&gt; KIM: "Elton John tour. 1980, Forum Club." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to throw them away. &gt;&gt; KIM: But why would they bring binoculars to the concert? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How bad were their seats, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. So my mom has been cleaning up her storage space in order to move on from this kind of complicated chapter, and, you know, it's hard once you've spent 25 years of your life with someone. I couldn't even imagine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, am I supposed to hold on to these? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. That's so weird. I just want to go skiing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just feel like it's, like, not aligned in the cards for us to do anything. There's been a lot of just craziness happening. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's all the more reason why we have to go somewhere. There is a place that's gorgeous in Montana called The Big Sky. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've never been to Montana. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have never been to Montana either. It'll be like a kids' trip. There has been a lot going on in our family, especially with Bruce lately, so I think it's really important that we keep a family trip to insure that the family just stays close. Even if it's just the kids. No more trips with Mom and Bruce. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So no more family trips, all of us? That's so sad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thailand was the last one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is our first family trip since our parents' divorce. I never really thought about, until this moment, that our holidays, trips or anything else special and monumental in our lives-- they're never gonna be the same again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's to another good day in Greece, everybody. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yay! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go, Khloe! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let it go. Let it go! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now that so many things are changing, we're gonna have to make and create new traditions, and I think it's about the kids forming that bond and never letting us lose touch with one another. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, a calm trip with the kids. Let's make it about that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They will have a lot of fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know it's raining? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT:Oh, you did? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. This house has a lot of windows. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, shades are closed. I just saw in the bathroom that it's pouring rain. Wow. Kim just said the ski trip is on now. Are we gonna go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I'd like to go. It's just a lot of work. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I feel like it would be nice to get out of here and go enjoy some of the outdoors, maybe take a hike. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You would never take a hike. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know that you know that. I'm a new man. It's definitely no secret that I've been struggling over the past couple years with some of my inner demons, so I decided to go to a center and actually work on these things. They definitely made me confront my issues head-on, which was definitely scary, but extremely helpful to see what I needed to do to better my life and move forward. I'm excited. I want to go to a ski mountain with you. I know Mason would like to build a snowman. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to go. I'm just saying... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. All right, so you're in! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It gives me anxiety thinking it's, like, our first trip with the baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The more we travel, the easier it gets. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Mason. Last thing-- do you have ski clothes that fit? Should we get some maternity stuff? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, first of all, I'm not pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Same vibe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They don't even make maternity ski clothes. You're not allowed to ski when you're pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That can't be true. There's got to be some people that are living on the edge. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Relax. I'll figure it out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, ta-ta. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I'd love to travel in the same direction as traffic. Just FYI. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm. Today, all of us kids, except Rob and Kendall, are going to Montana together, and I am super excited. Us kids have never gone on a family trip ever together, so this is definitely something new for all of us and the babies. And I'm just really excited to be in new weather, go skiing, and, hopefully, I actually remember how to ski. Can you show Malika the bracelets you make? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Let me see. &gt;&gt; MASON: I made that one for Daddy. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: So... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And he wears them every day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, you little big boy. I'm actually very excited to go to Montana. This is the first time that we have taken a trip with the new baby, and it should be a good time. I'm pretty excited, actually, and I usually don't get excited about much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is Kylie coming on this flight? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, they're all meeting us from New York. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Got it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie-- she's just been a little bit more distant lately. You know, I think with everything that's been going on with Bruce, I totally understand if she is having a hard time dealing with everything, and do want her to feel that we're all here to support her, because we're all, you know, going through the same thing, and we just have to be there for each other and support each other. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How old are you now? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Five. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're five? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How old do you think I am? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: 54. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 54?! What?! &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you guys talking about over here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just chilling with the kids. I meant to ask you. Are Jonathan and Malika staying at the house with us? &gt;&gt; KIM: I booked a room at a hotel nearby Jonathan can stay at. Maybe Malika can either sleep in your bed or on the couch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, your friend gets the lap of luxury, and you want Malika to sleep on a couch? Kimberly knows Jonathan and Malika's dynamic. They bicker and kind of fuss about everything. So I feel like you have to treat them the same. Getting Jonathan a penthouse without even discussing it with me and then just expecting Malika just to sleep on a couch, I think that's really selfish. Shouldn't you have told me this so I could have either hooked Malika up, too, or...? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I just thought you like her close to you. Like, she's always just been... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think I might have an ear in--tion. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, you think that I like Malika close to me while you have Jonathan, literally, in the major crevice of your anus. And you think I like Malika next to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Takes an elevator right up your tuchis. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was so hard to find a house that would satisfy everyone's needs. I didn't even mean to leave Malika out. You would think that Khloe would just at least acknowledge the fact that I've planned everything else. The house isn't big enough with all the people. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get over yourself. She's not sleeping on a couch. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at her butt crack! That's my girl! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Where is my room, before I freak theout? I don't want to talk to anyone else right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie's the one we're worried about. I don't want her to emotionally go away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Welcome to Montana, guys! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're going up to the North Mountain. &gt;&gt; MASON: Santa! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're not at the North Pole. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're going bye-bye, Northy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: âŞ We're in Montana! âŞ &gt;&gt; KIM: Montana... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah, we get it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did that make you laugh, Northy? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Your mommy's funny. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My gosh, my little Khloe. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Amsterdam. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Bruiser. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We just landed in Montana. &gt;&gt; KIM: Montana. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What the hell are you doing in Montana? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're here on a kid ski trip. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, get out of here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We just got here, and, um, we're caravanning. And we just wanted to check on you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm okay. Oh, so, go. Go have a good time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Bye. What did we decide on the housing situation, Keeks, for Jonathan and Malika? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't know there wasn't enough rooms, and Kim got Jonathan a hotel room, and I said, "You should have told me, 'cause I would have got Malika one, too." I don't think Malika could be sleeping on the couch while Jonathan's in a penthouse. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Why would me being on the couch ever be an option? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's what I'm trying to figure out. &gt;&gt; NORTH: Da-Daddy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the house, guys. Look at the snow. &gt;&gt; MASON: Snowman! Snowman! Snowman! Snowman! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Montana! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, la, la! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, it's the Shangri-la. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The Shangri-la? &gt;&gt; KIM: How pretty is it, guys? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at this fireplace. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love the understatement. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have to give myself props for finding this place so last minute. There's so much space, but it's so cozy. It's, I think, the perfect house for all of us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at these views. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Room's beautiful. Wow. These were Jews? Yeah! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, hello! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, look who it is-- the Kyster! Kaiser Permanente! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kyles! I wasn't sure if you were actually gonna be making it here. Jonathan. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's up? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, what's up? What's going on? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How are you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So where's my room? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I really need to know before I freak theout. I didn't know if I wanted to come on this trip because my sisters keep trying to push me to talk about things, but I don't really want to talk to anyone else right now. We all just cope with different things in different ways. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Was that it for Kylie? She's done? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Did she quit? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's it? She's done for the day? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is she? &gt;&gt; LEIGH: This is beautiful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Isn't this nice out here? &gt;&gt; LEIGH: This is kind of the life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So you've talked to Kourtney, right? &gt;&gt; LEIGH: I did. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, here are my concerns. Kourtney and, uh, Kim and Khloe-- they're... they seem to be fine. Kylie's the one we're worried about. She's younger, very emotional, um, having a hard time dealing with this. You know, I do everything I can to try to stay in touch, but, um, she doesn't want to talk about it. She's kind of just shut me out lately. And that's... that's what bothers me, you know? &gt;&gt; LEIGH: There's always a reason to avoid confronting the things that aren't so fun to talk about. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I agree. I-I agree with that. My big concern is just that... You know, we've had such a close relationship. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: Yup. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, for so many years. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: Yup. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And my kids are everything to me, and I-I want, uh, that to continue. And I don't want that space between us, you know, where she'll go months and not talk to me about nothing, and I call her up to try to get a... you know, to go to dinner and talk or come out here to the house. I don't want her to, you know, go away, emotionally go away, you know? &gt;&gt; LEIGH: Seems totally appropriate and totally normal that in this short amount of time that she's dealing with some pain, and she's keeping it in. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: She will come around. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think so. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: And it's kind of age-appropriate, so I would say... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, it is age... &gt;&gt; LEIGH: ...I would say it's probably less about you and more about her going through her process. Hopefully, she will get help to open up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; LEIGH: Understandable. Understandable. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at... look at Mase, look at Mase. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at her butt crack! She looks like a plumber! That's my girl. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you ready, Northy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, put your feet up. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm making it to go slow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's not scary at all. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Someone's gonna get hurt going this fast. &gt;&gt; KIM: Northy! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, slow down! I don't know if I have smelled or breathed crisper air. I have a newfound respect for the outdoors. Everything just feels better here. I mean, I feel like the air is more fresh, I can think clearer. I can just appreciate life a little bit more. Get on before it leaves. I've always had a lot of ups and downs in my relationship with Kourtney, and she's stuck by me through thick and thin, and I have to say if there's anything in the world that I appreciate the most, it's definitely her and the kids. You hold on to me. Okay? Holy... We're coming in full force! Watch it, Marty! Holy guacamole! Who's up for Pictionary tonight? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Family Pictionary. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What about Heads Up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Remember when we used to play that? &gt;&gt; KIM: What about spin the bottle? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're all family. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, that's what's so much fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We should spin the double-sided dildo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Haven't you guys seen the double-sided-- one's black, one's white. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: To switch out? &gt;&gt; KIM: I wonder if they make one. If not, we should do one. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: So you're staying here tonight? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, no, no, no. I'm gonna go to the hotel. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: They told me you were staying in the room here. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, the hotel is sold out except for the penthouse. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's not gonna work for me, sorry. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I think it's kind of settled, because Kim got me my room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're in a penthouse-- why don't you share? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, I honestly think we-we might have to flip for this, Jon. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wait, what are you talking about? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, Jonathan's one team, Malika's one team. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I should be the other. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For tonight's playoff in the Pictionary game. Whoever wins gets the penthouse outside of this house. Wait, what's the other game we play, not Pictionary? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Charades. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Charades. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Charades is like, "movie." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's play charades instead; that's way better and fun. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: So whoever, what, wins gets the room? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: If I have to fight you for a room key, it's happening, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh-oh, snapple-pop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Jon, will you look at this and tell me which pic you like best? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I feel like I haven't had, like, two minutes with you alone here. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. Okay, there's that. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's a good one, right? I'm so tired. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I got to ask you something. Like, when I'm in New York and stuff, everyone keeps asking me about Bruce. Like, is there's something going on that's, like... that I need to know about that I don't? &gt;&gt; KIM: I really haven't mentioned anything about Bruce to anyone, but now that Bruce has shot this Diane Sawyer special, I know that the time has come, and I don't want my friends to not really be in the loop, especially my close friends. But it's just... I don't even know what to say. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's take this to Bruce. Going through all these photos bring up a lot of emotion. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I really want to go on this tram that goes to the top. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going to the highest peak on this mountain, and it's one of the most dangerous. Look how crazy it is up there. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Everyone keeps asking about Bruce. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know what to say besides it's all true. I was kind of waiting for you to ask me this. It's something that Bruce has always felt, since he was really little, that this is who he is. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Like, how is he doing? Like, is he, like, he's happier than, like, it's, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: He's definitely happier than ever. I don't know-- I feel, like, relieved for Bruce that he can be who he wants to be. But, like, I think it's such a huge adjustment for the whole family and... I think he's moving really fast, and he thinks, "No, I waited, you know, 65 years. I'm moving really slow." &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: And what about Kendall and Kylie-- like, how are they even functioning? They're, like, so young. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just really hard. But, like, we have the sisters to really, really talk about this with, and I think that has saved everything. If it was just one kid-- or even Kendall and Kylie-- it would be much harder. In coming out to Jonathan and just being honest with him about Bruce, it's like I feel like this weight has been lifted off my shoulders. It feels good to be able to have him in my circle of friends that I can actually talk to about this. It's, like, so good to get away without our parents. Just to have Kylie kind of get away. I think it's really refreshing for her. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah. Wow. Hope everybody's gonna be all right. &gt;&gt; KIM: We will. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Let's go play charades. Come on, Malika, I want my room. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The teams are Jonathan, Kourtney, Kylie, Khloe. Malika, Kim, Scott. Okay, Jonathan, you're going first. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is there a time frame? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One minute. Ready, set go. A body. Big butts. Big puss. A suitcase, pants, pockets. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Boxers. Pockets. &gt;&gt; KHLOE/KYLIE: Underwear. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yes, underwear! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, Malika's team. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Scott, make it good. My sleep depends on it. Three words, first word. &gt;&gt; KIM: Peace out. Peace in the Middle East. Third word. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Third word is 45 seconds left. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hunger, turkey, food, sandwich, starve. &gt;&gt; KIM: Slice, piece. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I know what it is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Piece of pie, piece of food... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Piece of cake! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bow! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Still that confident? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We about to get that room back to Malika. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is it Kylie's turn or Jonathan's? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Kylie has to play. She has to play. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Go get her. Kylie? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think with everything that's been going on with Bruce, Kylie is having a hard time dealing with everything. And I just hope that Kylie can kind of talk about her feelings and just have a good time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We are tied. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Come on, Kourt, you can do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Time. One word. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: One word. Sewing, shot. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow! Ow, bee sting, bee. Mosquito bite, mosquito. Yeah! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sister, sister. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys are, like, in each other's heads. Mosquito. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Right, yeah. This is the one for the win. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your timer's going on starting now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Two words. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What?! &gt;&gt; KIM: Shoot, explode. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Make it rain? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: 30 seconds left. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: This is not good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Tiny sperm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: This is never gonna happen. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Time's up. I think Spider-Man is one word. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's going... What... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It was capitalized. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For "spiderweb." &gt;&gt; MALIKA: The S and the M. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, we are the champions of the world! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wow, looks like Jonathan's gonna be sleeping good tonight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We won. Listen, I'm not built to, like, throw away games, so suck it up, Malika. Sorry. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We won. Malika, can you get my bags, please, and put 'em in the... put 'em in the &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Never gonna happen. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Guys, this was real fun. Scott, good luck with Malika. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Buford, let's go. It's time to get our ski on. Yeah, baby, yeah! Yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have to brush your teeth 'cause you have food in it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what gets you not excit... Let's get... Let's get out there. Black diamond's calling our name. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Black diamonds? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah, baby, that's what they call me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: In the past, Scott has always been such a Debbie Downer on most of our family vacations. Why are you even drinking? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna grab a quick smoke. You bring me back to the hotel? &gt;&gt; CAPTAIN: Yes, what about the other? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nah, forget about them. Oh, I literally just want to go home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Go home! No one's stopping you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, book it! I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think it's great that he has been working on himself. I definitely notice a difference in his attitude, and I'm hoping that this is a change that will continue. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at how beautiful it is out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's gorgeous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It is everything and more. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Come in. I think I want to double up on socks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So double up on socks. You were cold yesterday. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You look cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I look so big though. I like being in fitted clothes. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But I like when you wearlike that, 'cause then I can see you. So I really want to go on this tram that goes to the top... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't you want to just have, like, a family ski day and ski with everyone? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We'll do it first and then we'll meet with everyone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, basically, I don't have an option. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Not really. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Typically, if Kylie were to ask me to go on some frightening... ski mountain, I would decline and say go with your dad. But I feel like I have to kind of tough it out and say yes. Oh. Look how crazy it is up there. Oh. Holy smokes. That is so scary. Holy We're going to the highest peak that there is on this mountain. And it's one of the most dangerous. You have to take five different lifts to try to get to the one lift to take us all the way to the top. Kyles. Look how crazy it is up there. Look, you can't even see the top of the mountain. That's where you want to go? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, thisis fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? I don't want to go all the way up thetram. I am freaking theout. Holy &gt;&gt; KIM: Feels really good to be out skiing. I haven't skiied in years. Oh! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're a pain in the ass, Malika. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just really can't believe that this rooming situation fight is still happening. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Stay in Khloe's bed tonight. Try to kiss her again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kyles. Look how crazy it is up there. We're going to the highest peak that there is on this mountain. And it's one of the most dangerous. Look at that, you're gonna kill yourself. I'm shaking and I'm literally so nervous, and Kylie is as cool as a cucumber, doesn't even care. This bitch is crazy. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MAN: So right now, I mean, it's kind of gnar up there, blowing hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It looks like it. &gt;&gt; MAN: It could be worth skipping today. Just my recommendation. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I'm on your page. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, on the same page? Okay, right on. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love adrenaline and always love challenging myself, but I guess they're saying the conditions are really bad and we shouldn't go up there, so I guess it's not happening. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, no, thanks. No, thanks. The angels were all working in my favor today. I'm literally thanking the Lord. I'm so happy and I'm not arguing with him. I got out of dying today. Don't you want to just have hot chocolate? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kind of. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Wait, slow it down. Slow it down. &gt;&gt; KIM: Feels really good to be out skiing. I haven't skiied in years. The mountain is so empty, and we're just having so much fun. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh! My God, I think I killed myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim doesn't even help. You're so mean. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ski clothes are not made for people with butts. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: That's kind of cute on you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it doesn't go over my butt. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Come on, Malika, why are you always taking so long? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: It's not me, it's Khloe-- Khloe has to find something to wear. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I feel like it's you. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Be patient, dude. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I feel like you're taking longer than Khloe did. It's, like, come on. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You sayall the time. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I don't talk at all. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Why don't you tell Khloe what you said about her last night? 'Cause you said you'd say it to her face, so why don't you say it to her face? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Which part? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: The cooler sister is Kimberly. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, yeah. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Malika, you're always causing Yes, I did say Kim is more famous than Khloe, but Khloe knows that. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Yeah, and all I'm saying is I said you wouldn't say it to her face... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: And I said it to her face. What's the... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, I said it to her face, so don't act shocked now. Doesn't mean you don't love her. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: So far, all you do is bring stuff up in front of Scott. She's so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just really can't believe that this rooming situation fight is still happening. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You know, you're a pain in the ass, Malika. Uh, literally, don't stay in the room. Stay in Khloe's bed tonight. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I can stay wherever I want. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Try to kiss her again tonight. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I found heli-skiing. It's where they, like, you get in a helicopter and they fly you to the top. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who thegoes heli-skiing? I thought this was, like, a big, safe helicopter. My anxiety is through the roof. Oh,a duck! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Whoa, watch this person. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's this driver in front of me, and they keep slamming on their brakes. Yo, this is not theway to drive thecar! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like your ass gets bigger every day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want it to get bigger. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Crazy, I've never seen something like that in my life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, that's just rude. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: In a good way. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's not a good way. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, I looked online and I found heli-skiing/heli-boarding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. What the hell is that? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's where they, like... you get in a helicopter and they fly you to the top and you, like, jump out of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm. You're doing this by yourself? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I want you to do it with me. I'm determined to go to the highest peak on the mountain, and since we didn't do the tram, I am not gonna miss this helicopter ride. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I used to be a really good skier, but I haven't done it in so long. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, you'll see, I guess. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Once I'm... once the helicopter leaves? What happens if we needed to... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, no, we'll do, like, a practice round. Not on the helicopter. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. If Bruce came with us to Montana, he would love to do all of these things that Kylie wants to do. I like to stay in, like, my comfort zone. But, again, I definitely want to show her that I appreciate her coming, even though I'm really terrified to go heli-skiing. Like, who thegoes heli-skiing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: These are nice rooms. This is a nice house, in general. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It really is. Who does not put the price tags inside thepillows? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That is wild. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's all just try to, like, dig in and get all this stuff out of here. I'm tired of storing everybody else's stuff, like I'm the... trash collector. It's been a really intense couple of weeks. Bruce is starting a new chapter in his life, and the rest of the family is, too. Did somebody bring a label maker? That makes it really difficult to sort through all this stuff and kind of relive the past. There's a lot of history in this storage unit. Oh, my God. This is her little placemat. That goes to Kylie. So we got to find some kind of a box. Kendall, Kendall, Kendall. Oh... my God. These are great Valentine's presents. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah. Absolutely. Look at that, you did shopping for free. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: There you go. Good. Now ready? Push those feet apart. Perfect. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, Mase. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Penelope wants to go on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She does? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The magic carpet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, so let her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So we're gonna put on her skis when Mase comes down. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, it's definitely becoming more and more difficult to travel, especially as our family is getting larger. Yeah, that's good! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All by herself. P, you're like a professional skier. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's refreshing to be somewhere with everybody, and I just want to take it all in and create some memories and, you know, be excited for it all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, Mase. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, Marty! We are the most annoying parents ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, so this is all, like, Bruce Jenner's stuff. This is a Bruce box. That's a Bruce thing. This goes to Bruce. It's his accordion or something. These, I think, are all his training shoes. Going through all these photos... Oh, my God. ...and looking at all this memorabilia... Oh, it's Olympic stuff. ...all these things that we have... Look at my baby's ice skates. They're so cute. ...definitely bring up a lot of emotion. And I don't have a crystal ball. I don't know what's gonna happen. All I can do is be there for my kids, and we just have to stick together as a family. "Dear Kris Jenner, I was recently watching your show and saw you had a segment on spicing up your marriage." Well, this one doesn't pay attention 'cause I'm divorced. Oh! I have included our newest line of seamless waterproof medical-grade silicone vibrators. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: They're somewhere in the storage unit. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: I want the vibrators! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just hit the vibrator jackpot! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm really freaking out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Khlo, I'm so excited for you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Am I gonna die? Thank God I have a helmet on. I am not really, like, a big heights person. On your, like, itinerary for the day, I normally would never see heli-skiing as one of my options. That's the helicopter you guys want to go on? Holy I thought this was, like, a big, safe helicopter. &gt;&gt; MAN: So, guys, we have some radio transceivers for you, in case there is an avalanche. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, what? You have to wear an avalanche backpack so the people can find you after you die. My stomach is in knots, and I am freaking theout. This is crazy. I think I have to pee. Can we go back down the hill? The more that we're going higher and higher and higher, my anxiety is through the roof. &gt;&gt; MAN: We are at 10,000 feet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, how did we get into this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Both of you have a inferiority complex. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get your head out of everybody else's ass, and pay attention to your family trip! Get over yourself and all your little people! &gt;&gt; KIM: You're such abitch! &gt;&gt; MAN: We are at 10,000 feet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. I don't think I can get down this hill. Oh,a duck! &gt;&gt; MAN: You guys are landing here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, hell no. &gt;&gt; MAN: Stay low! You ready? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right, let's do it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Come on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. I was freaking out at the bottom of the mountain, so now I'm, like, really terrified. I can't... You guys, I can't get up! This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Come to me! Come to me! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't get back up! &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay. Three, two, one. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It was harder, bro. What do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; MAN: She went to go check out these trees right here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Although we are so high up, the terrain is not as crazy as I thought it'd be. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But it is so funny watching Khloe clearly having a hard time with this. Are you okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm over this whole skiing thing. This is definitely the craziest thing I think I've ever done. It just isn't really my thing. But I'm really proud of myself for pushing myself and for doing something new, and now I can say I've gone freaking heli-skiing. Like, that's pretty badass. Oh, my God. Kylie, I never would have done this without you. Ever. I brought this on the trip and didn't take it once. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I had my face on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We killed that one. Um, I seriously thought that the helicopter was so intense, and I thought that was kind of, like, the craziest it could get. I understand why you're, like, this adrenaline junkie, and I feel like you're doing all these things to, like, distract your mind, 'cause I just feel like you're going through a lot and that's your form of therapy. But I feel like you also do it 'cause you feel like that makes you like you're the Jenner and you feel like that's your connection. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, I like it. I genuinely enjoy doing things like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I feel like you're doing all this and you're doing it with, like, me, which I love, but I think that should be your bonding stuff with your dad. There's been so much going on with Kylie emotionally, and I think she has to realize that her dad will always be her dad. All of her fun, athletic ways-- that's all her dad's blood running through her veins. Your dad loves that Your dad would've totally pushed you to go on the tram. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, it would've been fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would've been traumatized. He thinks we're such pussies. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. 'Cause you guys are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Blue balls. Watch out, guys. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:yeah! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's the wrong color-- you're solids. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you don't know the color I am. The first thing I just got in. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're solids, bitch. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I get to go again. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think on the next thing that you scratch, you need to apologize to Malika. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: For what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, everything she told me at the Burton store yesterday. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Are you s... Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, what happened at the Burton store? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: He said I was jealous because his best friend is more famous, 'cause that is so the reason why me and... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That's not what I said; I said I got the room because Kim's more famous. I didn't say I'm friends with her 'cause she's famous. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, no, no, you didn't say that... He didn't say... No, he said, like, "I was..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who got you the room? Kim's fame paid for it? &gt;&gt; KIM: I invited Jonathan on this trip, so I took care of my end. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Right. Why didn't Khloe get you a room?! &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Why are you yelling at her? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You never told me that the house had limited boarding. You knew how many people were coming on this trip. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She had a bedroom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, she didn't. She wanted her to sleep with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that both of you have ainferiority complex. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, burn. Maybe that's why I don't want to hang out with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Jonathan and I click, we vibe. He doesn't need to, like, entertain me all day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He sits in the corner and juggles until you laugh. Like, stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why don't you guys just go make out again. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Get drunk again, Malika. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honey, if you want Khlo Money to come out of the cage, I will take my hoops off and put some Vaseline on my face and I will whup your ass. Get your head out of everybody else's ass, and pay attention to your familytrip! Get over yourself and all your little people! &gt;&gt; KIM: You're such a &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Daddy-o. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. It's my daughter! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I miss you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I miss you, honey! You know what I'm doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm moving in to the new house. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall told me about the horsey situation. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's just great trail riding all over this place, so I told Kendall if she wants to buy a horse, I can put him up. We'll build a stall and all that kind of stuff for him. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's so much fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What else is going on? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, m-me and Khloe... me and Khloe went heli-skiing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get out of here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It was so fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, there's nothing better than good powder, you know? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. I wish you were out here to do crazy things with me. Me and my dad have so many things in common. He's making a lot of changes, but I want to make sure I keep a close bond with him. I want to do some adrenaline stuff when I get back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. We will do some fun stuff, and we'll talk about the horses. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right. Love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love you. Till then, babe. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This place is beautiful. There's a lot of really nice houses. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Michael Keaton lives over here and Justin Timberlake. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No way. J to the? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I feel like they all live in Yellowstone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So this is different? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: This is different. This is Big Sky. Then there's... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but Yellowstone, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that Yellowstone National Forest? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, that's, like, two minutes from L.A.; this is far. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's six hours from L.A. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, well, this isn't six hours away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was just asking. That's why I asked the question. If you don't ask, you'll never know. Wouldn't you rather me ask you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But, technically, if you were on a plane for an hour and 50 minutes... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When you go to Vegas, it's... No, when you go to Vegas, it's 50 minutes. And, guess what, driving can still be six hours. So an hour and 60 minutes... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right! That's exactly my point. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No.off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You double the flying time. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: We don't need you to look at Khloe; look at the road. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hungry, fella? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: So watch out. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Whoa, watch this person. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got a 16-wheeler behind me. Can, like... you just figure out where you're gonna turn? There's this driver in front of me, and they keep slamming on their brakes, trying to turn off the highway, but then they don't actually turn off the highway. And not to mention there's a 16-wheeler truck right behind me riding my ass. Are youstupid?! There's a 16--wheeler! It's ajoke! Yo. This is not the way to drive acar! What theis wrong with you?! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh... &gt;&gt; SCOTT:idiot! I got to get all of us killed! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, you're driving, like, crazy. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, hello, London. I'm excited for Fashion Week. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why are you following me everywhere? That's my time to, like, get away from home. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: The question is why did we place the embryo and you didn't get pregnant. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am getting a biopsy now because IVF did not work for me. Oh, my God. I don't know how much longer I can go through with this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you hear Bruce is having the surgery? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to get my last visual of him without some major physical changes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not my fault, not my fault! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God, I don't have my seatbelt on! Holy!
