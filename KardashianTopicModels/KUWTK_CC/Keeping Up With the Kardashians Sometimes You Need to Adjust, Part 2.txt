- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's great to be back in New York; maybe we can get into a little trouble. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Welcome home! For the past few months, Khloe and Lamar haven't been in Los Angeles. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's grand opening of his restaurant is happening. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In New York? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe could come, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have so much to do. Going to New York is kind of the last thing I should be doing. There's a lot of pressure on me right now. I can't commit to going. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe's having all these excuses that aren't real. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: People don't get like how muchI'm under. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so crazy. I think she loves that she's his like everything. Khloe's just trying to make Lamar's world so perfect, so that just makes me frustrated. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're officially an Odom. Are you gonna come to New York? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why the hell are you guys pressuring me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm not coming. It's the pressure, the pressure, the pressure, so guess what? I am an Odom. Bye, Kardashians. &gt;&gt; 23 00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,369 &gt;&gt; KIM: So tonight I'm partnered up with the charity Dress for Success. Dress for Success will help empower women to look their best in order to go on job interviews and get a job. Hi. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Hi, Kim. Can you tell me a little about what drew you to Dress for Success? &gt;&gt; KIM: For a company that really helps give confidence to women. And we had an amazing contest today, where we... &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; MAN: Back up, back up. Back up, back up. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm doing the red carpet, and all of a sudden, I get this powder all over me, and I'm so shocked. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Wow. She poured powder all over me. I mean, I think I can like clean this off and be good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go this way. Let's go. Where's Mario? Can you blow-dry the back of her jacket right here? &gt;&gt; KIM: I just needed some extra powder to set my makeup. Now, I've definitely experienced my fair share of haters, but I don't want to ruin the night just because this anti-fur organization tried to ruin our event with this flour bomb. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; REPORTER: What an amazing trouper you are to brush that crap off and continue. &gt;&gt; KIM: I respect people's time, so I wouldn't want to waste your guys' time for coming out. I appreciate it. I told my makeup artist I needed a little bit more powder. 51 00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,157 I didn't think they'd bring that much. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? What should we do to your sister's room? Pink walls? &gt;&gt; MASON: I like green. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Green? &gt;&gt; KIM: But do you like green for you, or you want green for your sister? &gt;&gt; MASON: I want green. I'm gonna go downstairs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, I heard that you keep posting pictures of you and Khloe when you were young. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know she's on Twitter. She writes all the time. I know she sees our tweets. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How's that working for you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I don't know. She hasn't responded. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I really do miss Khloe, so I just figured I can tweet some like baby pictures of us just to kind of put in Khloe's head, to kind of let her know we always will stick together, and we'll always make time for each other. I just like want my sister back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Try calling her now; let's see if she answers. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna need some backup. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; RECORDING: Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice-messaging system. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Khlo, it's Kim. I'm here with Kourtney, and we're just calling you to tell you we miss you, so call us. Bye. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Where are we going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Going to see my restaurant. I've been putting a ton of time in at my restaurant, trying to get things ready, and, you know, the process is definitely a lot longer than I thought it was gonna be. It's tough with the family, but I think it's worth it in the end. I mean, I just want everything to be perfect. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, this is it? This is a good spot right here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Hey, &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, How are you? I like this location, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Location's insane. Where is this gonna come to? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: About five feet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where is the drape? The metal drape? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: The metal drape, that would be in... They're not putting it in yet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's still wires showing, there's still exposed brick. Did you test this? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: No, not yet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's got to be a lot that happens in a very quick amount of time. I mean, it's pretty scary. I mean, this place looks unbelievable, but, you know, when I look around, I'm not disrespecting anybody, but there's a lot of work that needs to be done, and I'm freaking out. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: I'm a little nervous also; I've been... I've been... We've been on this project for three months. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just want to make everybody proud. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; BRIAN: You're in very good hands. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Every time that I had any openings, I mean, the walls are still wet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'mstressed. I really just want to make Kourtney really proud of me. She's had a lot of doubts already, and I don't want her to have more. I got good news. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Everything's finally done with the restaurant. I'm so pumped. The lease is finally gonna get signed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll believe it when I see it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The last thing I want to do is have her see the place without it being, you know, 114 00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,271 completely done and ready to go. If this isn't perfect, I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; Mommy! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, let me see. Can we open it? Yeah, watch. Okay, then we put this head back on. You ready to watch? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; MASON: Ooh, mmm, yummy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Rob. How's New York? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's good, it's good. I'm chilling. Is Kim with you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? &gt;&gt; ROB: You hear about that song that Kanye released? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I've heard it. So what? &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, come on, it is so about you. You just got flour-bombed and he just thinks it's hilarious. "Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor." &gt;&gt; KANYE: ♫ Kanye West ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kanye West is a rapper. &gt;&gt; KANYE: ♫ Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kanye has a new song out where he talks about falling in love with Kim. &gt;&gt; KANYE: ♫ And I'll admit I fell in love with Kim ♫ Around the same time she had fell in love with him ♫ I went for the kiss, and you went for the hug. ♫ Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and Kanye have been friends for years, and they've been hanging out lately, and I have no idea if it's serious or not 'cause I haven't really talked to Kim about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, just 'cause I'm seen with someone, does it automatically mean that's my boyfriend? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, but you've obviously been cool with him for a while, so I just... &gt;&gt; KIM: Why don't you stay out of my business? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you not ask questions? I don't ask questions. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, guys, you can hang up whenever you want. I don't really say bye, so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so we'll just hang up. We'll hang up. &gt;&gt; KIM: He truly is like a weirdo. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, thank you. &gt;&gt; KHADIJA: Who did you just ignore? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim. &gt;&gt; KHADIJA: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's so annoying. &gt;&gt; KHADIJA: You don't want to talk in front of me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I'm just like, I don't want to talk to them. They keep asking me about Scott's restaurant opening, and I said I don't know if I can confirm New York. Like it blew up to like a fight where I was just... &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, it was really-- that's how much I blew up. &gt;&gt; KHADIJA: He's disappointed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I just walked off, and I was like, you know what,you guys. It's too much pressure. Like basically I don't want to go anymore. Kim's just putting so much pressure on this New York trip, and the reason why I haven't brought it up to Lamar yet is 'cause we just moved back from Dallas. He's trying to get back into his routine. I'm just over it. I don't feel like bringing it up right now. &gt;&gt; RECORDING: You have one new voice message. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Khlo, it's Kim. I'm here with Kourtney, and we're just calling you to say we love you and we miss you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHADIJA: That was really funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My sisters are pretty cute at the same time. &gt;&gt; KHADIJA: Maybe you can talk to Lamar about going to New York, if you want. It could be a good, you know, situation for everybody. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Rob. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh, just checking some e-mails. When are you gonna get to New York? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had a couple meetings and I'll be on the next flight. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, what's this e-mail about that you just sent me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The sock line for 2012 sort of, um, fell apart as far as like a hard launch. &gt;&gt; ROB: What does that mean? We missed what? Like we missed the buying season or something? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We missed the deadline. They want to postpone it till spring 2013. &gt;&gt; ROB: My sock line that I've done so much work to this point, had all the designs ready, and now it's gonna be held into Christmastime because I missed the buying season, so I'm just, you know, sick of waiting at this point. I'm ready to launch this company. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What you should always do is keep four steps ahead of the game. &gt;&gt; ROB: But, listen, I'm just frustrated because Scott never comes through on a business, and now he's coming through, and so I just feel like, you know, I would've at least come through on this one. I love Scott; he's a great guy, he's very smart and very business-savvy, but I just thought that I would have something figured out before he would and, you know, obviously, that's not the case. It's, it's just, it's kind of frustrating, so. Love you. I gotta go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Bye. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's your wedding ring? "I just got out the steam." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I can't go in there wearing anything metal. I have to take off my earring. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You took off your earring this morning before you worked out. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You're just a good little girl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Baby? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Everyone's going to New York. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For Scott's restaurant opening. Kourtney and Kim think that I prioritize you over them. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: They probably miss you a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, and I miss them, too, from being in Dallas and all that, but I think I do a pretty good job of juggling everyone. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You know, they probably like overall miss you. We spend a lot of time together. I think we should go, support Scott, and hang out with everybody. We should go to New York. I feel really ♫ Broadway! ♫ ♫ I'm Lamar and I'm coming 224 00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:54,053 home ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: ♫ To Broadway ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, can we go? Wait, did you get a new car? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you like it? 229 00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,240 It's pretty fab, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not very pregnant-friendly. Um, are you turning into Mom? Do you guys both get new cars like every day? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is my friend's car that I'm borrowing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's your friend? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kanye. So Kanye and I, you know, we have, I think, a lot of things in common. We both just love cars, so what's the big deal? I'm just borrowing my friend's car. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're just friends and you're borrowing his car? &gt;&gt; KIM: Why can't I borrow his car? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so are you more than friends? &gt;&gt; KIM: Relax. It's not that serious. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whatever. It's fine. I think it is a little weird that Kim and Kanye are sharing cars, but I do get why Kim would want to be quiet about any relationship, especially considering her last relationship. &gt;&gt; KIM: We were having so much fun right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does he mostly live in New York? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mostly in New York, and then he has a place out here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So is he, when we're in New York, is he gonna be there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, he's gonna be there when we're all there. So that will be so much fun just to hang out and have some fun, you know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Hello? Kourt! I'm over at Kourtney's house. Kourt? I just wanted to apologize and make sure that there's no hard feelings, but she's not here. So I'm just gonna wait around because I'm excited to tell her that we're onboard and going. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't this dress cute? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, ho! &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, what are you doing here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You tweeting and posting all those pics. You really know how to work your social media, dude. And I'm sorry if you guys have felt that ever since I've moved to Dallas, that you're not as much of a priority, but... &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I get it. Like I get you had to do that. But I feel like you could have made a little bit more of an effort. We miss you on Christmas, we miss you on, you know, the big holidays that we've grown up our whole lives having you, so it was just hard for all of us, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was lonely. I was alone. Christmas Day, my husband got ejected from a basketball game. That was pretty much the worst Christmas I've had. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was actually very happy to make up with Khloe, and now Kim is starting to just bring up this entire fight all over again. &gt;&gt; KIM: You just have totally ditched us since you moved to Dallas and back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't start with me again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How's everything going with the restaurant? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Got so much to do and so little time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott always has an excuse about everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is going on? You and Yeez? 283 00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,710 &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I've taken this really slow with Kanye, but now is just the right time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys cannot give meright now. I'm coming here, I'm saying I'm sorry for ignoring you, so don't start with me again. So instead of picking another fight... &gt;&gt; KIM: Truce. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. going to New York. And guess whose idea it was most of all? &gt;&gt; KIM: Whose? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lama Junes'. &gt;&gt; KIM: No way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I'm so glad you guys are coming. I feel like we haven't got to hang out. All of us staying in the same hotel will be so much fun. I do feel bad about stressing Khloe out about coming to New York, but I am very happy that they're coming. Scott will be so excited. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God, your boobs are 299 00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:51,190 ginorm. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Va, va, voom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's it going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. Why do you look so weird? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why do I look so weird? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's Mase? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's good. He's sleeping. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I miss Mase. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's taking a nap. Wait. So it's so nice. Well, Khloe finally forgave us, and then Lamar was the one who was like, "I really want to go to New York." So they're gonna come. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is a lot of pressure, and it's more people, and I just got so much to do and so little time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, how's everything going with the restaurant? Is it gonna be done in time? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It better get done in time now that your whole entire family's coming. I want it to be good so everybody knows that I put together a real place that's like, you know, legit and good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm definitely a little bit nervous because Scott always has an excuse about everything, but I am hoping that Scott's restaurant opening will be a huge success. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. Love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Toodaloo. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yay, we're here! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're here. Our entire family is here in New York now, and everyone's just getting settled before we go to lunch. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is sushi? This place is sushi? Mason's sitting there. 327 00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:28,154 &gt;&gt; KIM: You can't have a knife. Oh, my gosh, look. &gt;&gt; MASON: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you talked to Scott yet? Have you seen him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you gonna go to the restaurant and see it before the opening? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sure he'll take me there to see it. seen Daddy's restaurant? &gt;&gt; MASON: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'm gonna go. I got to run. Rob said he's gonna come over here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye-bye. Kissy face. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. Should I sit here or here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Rob. Where's Scott? &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey. Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where's Scott? &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh, Scott... Uh, I don't know. He said he has to do... check up on the restaurant or something. I told him to come. I was like, you guys are right next door. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So Scott's right next door, and he couldn't come say hi? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, right next door. I told him he should come. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So bizarre. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So my entire family came to New York to support Scott, and no one has seen Scott. It's just common courtesy to say hi, and we're family. Even send us a text or anything. Like there's been no sign of Scott. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He just doesn't understand how to be not selfish. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm in New York to work on my restaurant. Doesn't mean I can't have a little fun while I'm at it. You get a little alcohol in me, and now, all of a sudden, I'm ready to go like the governor. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you're just over Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So do you want to break up with Scott? &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob! &gt;&gt; ROB: Sorry. I do it to Khloe all the time, and she's fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And I don't care. You have a bony ass. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's not a bony ass, it's just how I'm sitting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, but or is like that your... is that your bone? Like I don't know what... So, question-- what is going on? You and Yeez? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Yeez"? &gt;&gt; ROB: Ye... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just trying to be a little bit more private with my relationship and keep that to myself and not involve them in every last drama that goes on. I think they should be happy with that, 'cause they have so much going on in their lives. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like obviously you guys are serious. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know we've been friends for like 100 years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, you guys have been friends for like nine years, I get it. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I feel like... I mean, we're taking things really slow, but also it's-- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it's easier because you guys have known each other so long. &gt;&gt; KIM: Exactly. And we've always had this like, you know, mutual respect and love for each other. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kanye and Kim have always had some sort of chemistry towards one another, but either one had a crush on the other and the other one didn't, and then they would rotate feelings. It was never good timing. You know, he's always been a great friend. They've been through a lot together as friends. And he's always been such a great person. Well, I like Yeezy, I've always liked Yeezy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Me, too. 390 00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:26,132 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm just happy you're taking it slow. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, let's go, fine. You got me out. We're in New York. We'll go for a minute. You know, Rob starts telling me that he basically really just wants a partner to go out with. I'm in New York to work on my restaurant. Doesn't mean I can't have a little fun while I'm at it. I mean, if Rob wants to, why not? It'll be fun to kind of show Rob a little bit of New York, 'cause we've never been in the city together. I guarantee, if me and you walked into a spring break nightclub, they'd be probably throwing their panties at us. Didn't a girl throw her panties at you in Boston? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, man. That girl had the biggest butt. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did you play with it? &gt;&gt; ROB: Probably. I don't even remember. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank you. You know, I had no idea so much went into doing a restaurant. It's so crazy how much everything costs and how much you have to do. Little things you'd never expect add up. It's just stressful. &gt;&gt; ROB: What about Kourtney? Have you talked to her yet? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She was probably already in bed. &gt;&gt; ROB: We're gonna get wasted tonight. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, this is what you did. Look at this, man. You created a monster. You get me up and running, get my blood to start flowing, you get mya little hard, you get a little alcohol in me, and now all of a sudden I'm ready to go like the governor. You all right, there? &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's a lot of shots this guy's pouring out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Thanks. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, damn, this is hot. &gt;&gt; ROB: Just a shot of Jack. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, and some beer. Yeah, I'm starting to feel all right. &gt;&gt; ROB: Isn't that sad? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll have another drink or two here, maybe go to Darby after. Maybe go to 1 OAK for a minute. &gt;&gt; ROB: We'll hit it all up like your girl's &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's your girl... that's your sister you're talking about. You're a weird guy. Let's go hit another spot up. Yo, all y'all haters can suck on my Yeah. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Rob. Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Mase, make another really funny face. One, two, three. &gt;&gt; ROB: I didn't go to sleep last night. I had breakfast at 8:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did Scott stay up with you until 8:00? &gt;&gt; ROB: I did. He probably got home at like 6:00 or 7:00 also. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where'd you guys go last night? &gt;&gt; ROB: 1 OAK, and then we went to The Box. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who went with you to The Box? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're very inquisitive. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like to know. It's very annoying that my entire family is here only to support Scott and his restaurant opening, and he hasn't really spent time with any of us except for Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott's a big boy, and he shouldn't be hanging out till 5:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mind your own business; you worry about you, Scott, Mason, and the baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm worried about me and him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, not even Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So you're just over Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna have two kids; I can't have three. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So do you want to break up with Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I always do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You always do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So I don't know it it's hormonal or if I just hate him, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want you to be happy, obviously. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But if I was pregnant, and I was waiting for my boyfriend to come in, and he was out till all hours of the night, I would tell him, "Hit the road, Jack." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to say too much, because I want Kourtney to still come to me. Don't put yourself in a position where now Kourtney's not gonna want to talk to you. Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You shouldn't be treated like that. You're better than that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, he's an idiot. I'm obviously very aware of the situation that I'm in. There's no point in getting upset, and I don't need my mom to make things worse. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want to be there for her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you are there, so just be there. Sometimes you make things worse than what they are. Kourtney needs to deal with 475 00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:14,727 things, so she needs to deal with them. Leave her alone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely think that Scott owes me an apology and an explanation. It's really frustrating that I literally haven't seen him. He's been hung over all day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you hold him so your pregnant girlfriend doesn't have to hold him? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's the one who wants to hold him. I tell her all the time not to. You have to remember you're talking to the same girl who hasn't let him leave her bed in two years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you seen your girlfriend since you've been here? &gt;&gt; ROB: Can you guys stop so we can go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so annoyed with him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm in New York. It's my hometown. I went out with your brother. I didn't think it was the worst thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Scott always has an excuse about his behavior. His excuses can only go so far. &gt;&gt; ROB: Have you decided to forgive Scott considering he was out all night? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob, why are you trying to start a confrontation? &gt;&gt; ROB: You need to fix your &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN: I love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Those are fab. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Scott's here. No, don't give me a hug. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't seen you... I came here to see you, and I... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You haven't called me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, you've been busy every day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, working on this restaurant I'm trying to put together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, you've been out with him every night. You haven't seen anyone. You can't run away. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not running. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But when they landed... when they landed, you should have came to say hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've been told a million times that I run away from my problems, and I'm not saying I don't. I already have too much on my plate, and there's a lot of people with a lot of opinions. I don't need this from her right now. I don't really need this from anybody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whatever, it's fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're a piece of work. &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You get out of it like that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't understand. She's still mad at me for things that I did ten years ago and still drives me crazy. She, by no means, is over it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When the same thing happens once a month, it's hard to forget about the thing that happened the time before, 'cause then it happens again and 524 00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,541 again and again. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I don't know what to tell you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You think I look what today? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Pancakes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When people say "a pancake ass..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That means that you look flat. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: In my world, that means fluffy. Put some syrup on that joint. Eat that joint with milk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Who got you those? "K.W." &gt;&gt; ROB: "K.W."? &gt;&gt; KIM: What, my K.W. earrings? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: We were just out, and we saw them, and I thought they were so cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But did you buy them or he bought them for you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I bought them. &gt;&gt; ROB: So it's either Kim West or Kanye West. Which one is in your ear? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it means Kanye West. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think Kim wants to believe that she could take things slow, but let's keep it real-- you're wearing K.W. earrings. I know what that stands for. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want Swedish... All right, guys. I have to get something out of my room. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I'm not trying to be rude, but like there's something inside of me that just tells me that this restaurant's really not even gonna be opening. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just feel bad that it's like the same thing over and over and over and over again. Like when we were at Catch, do you know where he was eating? &gt;&gt; KIM: Where? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Exactly next door. He never came over to see Kourtney, he never cared to see his son, nothing. They never saw each other. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think it's rude that Scott is ignoring the family. He's worked so hard to get my sister back, and he's had a kid with her, and now they're about to have another child together, and it's just like, wouldn't you think you kind of would have learned from all your past mistakes? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wow, you look so good. Who would look away from those beautiful brown eyes? 562 00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:23,876 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you can't have sex with him! &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is this a joke? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, this is how Lamar likes it, so Khloe sends all these snacks from L.A. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just so funny like what a difference the preparation she does for her man and then what you would do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I said I used to pack for you and stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Please. Yeah, pack, that was it. But I'm saying you never would think to say, oh, I'm going to bring snacks for you or something. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I would a long time ago. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're right. I think it's the kid thing. And I messed up those privileges, I'm sure you're gonna say. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I realize Kourtney and I haven't been on the best terms since she got to New York because I've been so stressed out and running around trying to make everything happen for this restaurant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You say you have all this work to do for the restaurant, and then you go out till 6:00 in the morning and then sleep until 5:00. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was entertaining your brother! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He said that it was your thing and that you were like, "Let's go here, let's go here." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you joking? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. You have a girlfriend who's pregnant and home with your son. You don't need to be running out till 5:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're very emotional, you're very hormonal, and it's hard to be around you for me. I went out with your brother. Yeah, I got a little carried 591 00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,476 away, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So are we good? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're excellent. Oh, should I invite Elizabeth? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you...? 595 00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:43,855 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Chips. That was great. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey! &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing today? &gt;&gt; ROB: Got a shower, brushed my teeth. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what I forgot to tell you? Before I left, I had a meeting with all the agents at William Morris, and actually, we still have the deal. They didn't quite get what they needed. You've got to get shaking. I would be shopping at every single store you could find and just go look at socks and fabrics to get inspiration. &gt;&gt; ROB: I always do that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, it was your responsibility to get the stuff in there in time, and if somebody wasn't prompting you, then it's not my fault. You just gotta suck it up now. I tell the girls all the time I can't baby-sit everybody. Get yourtogether and 612 00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:33,171 start working really hard on this. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Ah, thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie's the hottest out of all of us. I think Kendall is like the prettiest like model-wise. Then I think Rob is the hottest brother. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's the only brother. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Kourtney's the smartest. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, thanks. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe's the funniest. And I think I'm the stupidest. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I see a gray. Wait. It was out. Look. &gt;&gt; ROB: So, Kourt, you decided to forgive Scott once again? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: To forgive Scott? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, considering he was out until 5:00, 6:00 in the morning, all night the day you came in. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: With you. Rob, why are you even trying to start like a confrontation? I thought we had a nice time out, and now you're like... &gt;&gt; ROB: You need to fix your 'cause if you think you're like somebig shot now, now that you have your little restaurant or whatever, like that's cool, but just show some respect to your family. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Everything's finally starting to be better, but Rob is now saying all these negative comments with this little 12-year-old jealous boy, negative attitude. I've never done anything to Rob to deserve that. &gt;&gt; ROB: You will never change, and like she deserves someone who actually will treat her right and will actually like come home to her, and you should know this stuff by now. It's not gonna obviously last a lot longer if it keeps going this way. That's all I got to say. And I'll see you all at dinner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I realized it was the first time in a really long time that you've been happy. The heart wants what the heart wants, and Kim knows what she wants. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But is he like your boyfriend? &gt;&gt; KIM: You fight like brothers. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. You know the night that him and I were out all night, in reality like I was like encouraging him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Here it is. What am I sitting on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. Here's to you ladies. Love and happiness. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: And no more drama. Kim seemed really happy today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was the first time in a really long time that you've been happy. I love her like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. I didn't know that Kanye was coming to Scott's restaurant opening. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I... We just randomly... Today was like... heard me talking about it, and he's like, "I'll go with you. Wait. Are you not inviting me, though?" And I was like, "No. I'd love you to come. I just don't want you to feel like the pressure of like coming with like Kourtney, Scott, Khloe, Lamar, you know." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that Kim is trying to take things slow, but the heart wants what the heart wants, and Kim knows what she wants. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar was like, "Now, if anyone is made for one another, it's those two." 'Cause Kanye was like, "No, Kim, you need to do your ponytail slicked back. I want it straight in the..." Like, he did... He told Kim how to do her hair the other day. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's like, "Wear this, wear this," and he, like, put my outfit together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar was like, "I'm tired of hearing about the that she can't talk to her boyfriend's about. Like I can't listen. I don't care about Kim's Chanel bags." So you and him are like officially like together? Like that's your main squeeze? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. I mean, I'm just taking it slow, and we've just like been, you know, hanging out all the time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But is he like your 680 00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:06,785 boyfriend? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know if I do titles. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh! You can't do that. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Look at these, these are sharp. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Is that Mason? &gt;&gt;: Who's that? Who's that? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Is that Mason I hear? Mason. Hey. See! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who is that? He wants to give you a hug. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's up, dude? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, so tall. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, you're so big, man. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want to sit on the couch over here? I know a lot is going on with Kourtney, and I know that she is stressed out, so Lamar and I are gonna baby-sit Mason. Yeah. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: See how you like it. Take it out there. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mmm. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Mmm. It's good? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you like that? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yup. Yup. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How good is the candy? &gt;&gt; MASON: Good. I want more candy. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You want a different kind this time? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. I want red. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Red? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yup. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Wow. You are starting to really communicate. Cheers. Let me see you dance. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. 704 00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,649 &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah... We gonna get you a little cousin to play with. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe my pants got like a hole in them. I'm so annoyed. &gt;&gt; ROB: You don't know how to sew. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I do. I am pretty domestic. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just feel like a for how I like yelled at Scott and kind of like just made him feel like a complete idiot. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott's been working on the restaurant for a long time, and I know you're probably frustrated that his restaurant is like coming out before your, you know, sock line. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's just really frustrating, 'cause I went to USC, studied entrepreneurship, and I wanted to be a business owner right out of the gate. It's definitely an eye-opener when, you know, Scott has this restaurant opening, and my sock line hasn't come out yet. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can't like, you know, not be happy for him. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Big smile, Scott! Here, Scott, up top. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's just nerve-racking. You know, everybody has huge expectations, and it's gonna mean a lot if everybody enjoys it, but it'll be very scary if people don't. Does this crowd look all right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I walk into the lobby, and there is Kourtney, and she's handing him a present. 727 00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,027 He goes, "Does this mean we're engaged?" And I'm like, "What the hell is going on?" &gt;&gt; KIM: I know you're probably frustrated that his restaurant is like coming out before your, you know, sock line. You can't like, you know, not be happy for him. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I know. I feel like a part of me was just like frustrated because I missed the buying season, so that process is delayed, and I kind of was like, I had all this momentum, and I... &gt;&gt; KIM: But that always happens. In my Tyler Perry movie, a huge production got delayed to make it better. You know what I mean? It doesn't mean it's not happening. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, no, I get it. I just... At the time, in the heat of the moment, I just wasn't like thinking like that. &gt;&gt; KIM: You fight like brothers. It's like you don't have any brothers so he's like your brother. &gt;&gt; ROB: Right. I was so caught up with my own problems, I didn't really kind of realize that Scott has all this pressure going on in his life, not only with his relationship, but with the opening of his restaurant. It's just unfair that I was putting him down. You know, the night that like him and I were out all night, like, you know, and I gave him for it, like in reality, 752 00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:32,090 like I was like encouraging him. &gt;&gt; KIM: So maybe you need to really apologize to him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think I should wear these shoes or these shoes? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like the pointy ones, but that's just me. &gt;&gt; KIM: These? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, the pointy, 'cause it's cold. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, babe. I'm so excited you're coming tonight. &gt;&gt; KANYE: You look great. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not with this, but I got that. &gt;&gt; KANYE: It's nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like the gold ones. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. I am so happy Kanye's coming with me to Scott's restaurant opening, and I don't want to make a big fuss about it. We're just hanging out. And that's it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: 'Cause I knocked on your door like three times. Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't you think this clutch is too busy for this? &gt;&gt; KANYE: No, it's cool. It's all right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, let me just get a little powder puff and a gloss, and we're good to go. &gt;&gt; MAN: Lookin' good, Scott. 773 00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,637 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah? Thanks. You, too. Finally, the opening is here, and thank God, 'cause all I want to do is get this done because it's killing me. I obviously have to go to the restaurant way before anybody else is gonna arrive. I need to be there to make sure things are okay before everybody gets there. It looks nice. &gt;&gt; MAN: You ready for tonight? You feelin' good? 782 00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:19,164 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's been a long time coming and a big process, and hopefully it pays off. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel that it's gonna do well, I mean, God willing, you know? Does this crowd look all right? It's just nerve-racking. You know, everybody has huge expectations, and it's gonna mean a lot if everybody enjoys it, but it'll be very scary if people don't. Why doesn't a cocktail girl come back here? Tell one guy to let the cocktail waitress in; everyone's dying. I'm excited for everybody to come, but it's just nerve-racking, you know? I am stressed, I am overwhelmed, and I really just want to hear good things, and hopefully Kourtney tells me she's proud of me. What up? What's going on, brother? You like it? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, I love it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Cool. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Love it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm extremely relieved. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It looks amazing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It definitely feels good that everybody came to New York to support my opening of my restaurant. It definitely makes me feel more a part of the family. &gt;&gt; KIM: Congratulations. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You've been talking about this since we were like in New York months ago. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know. &gt;&gt; ROB: What's this? The necklace you wear? &gt;&gt; KANYE: Yeah, I got it from my boy in Japan. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've never been to Japan. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I got to take you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's definitely clear that Kim and Kanye are into each other. Kim's had a really rough year, and of course, I want her to be happy. &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott? Hey, sit here for a second. So I was just saying how I shouldn't have treated you the way I treated you. I've been a littleto you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's all right. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's just kind of not jealous, but I was frustrated with how my sock line kind of got delayed, and you're actually doing something amazing for our family. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you. You know, you're my brother at the end of the day. I never had any siblings. I've always loved having you in my life. &gt;&gt; ROB: Seeing Scott accomplish this, it gives me a lot of motivation, because to have something successful that you're actually passionate about is probably the best feeling ever. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And when your sock comes, not only am I gonna put them on my feet, I'm gonna wrap 827 00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,617 them around myand walk down Fifth Avenue, feel me? Now give me some love. Thankfully, the restaurant opening went unbelievably well. I don't think it could have gotten any better. It was great that everybody showed support and came. It felt nice to see that I actually built something on my own. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that your new pocket square? &gt;&gt; MAN: You like that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yep. Doll, I got you a present. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got me a present? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause I'm proud of you for opening your restaurant. I got it before you were on your bad behavior rant. This trip to New York was definitely patchy for Scott and I, but I decided to give him this love ring, just to show him how I'm here through thick and thin. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But is this a promise ring? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, and it's that I'm proud of you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're not engaged? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just like the same old story over and over and over. He misbehaves, she ignores it, and then she rewards him for his bad behavior. I'm just over it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's beautiful, doll. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you. That's what you call romance. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I would've known this is up here, I would have been out here every day, seriously. &gt;&gt; KIM: So pretty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wait, the "W" on the West is turned upside down, so now it's an "M." Speaking of Kanye, did he have fun last night? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I think it might be a little overwhelming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think he was a really good sport, though. Oh, my God, you're never gonna believe what happened. I walk into the lobby, and there is Kourtney. Scott and her are talking and she's handing him a present. He opens it up, he goes, "Does this mean we're engaged?" And I'm like, what the hell is going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: At this point, we're all over it. No matter what advice we give, Kourtney does exactly what she wants to do. I mean, we've been going through this for like seven years now. It's not all his fault. She has set the tone of their relationship by sleeping in separate rooms. They have not slept in the same room in two and a half years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're too young for that. They've only been together, what, six or seven years? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's a long time. That's an eternity in my book. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, yeah, it's more than 72 days for sure. Next on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's up, London? I'm sick of nightclub appearances. I want to be royalty. &gt;&gt; MAN: I dub thee lord of the manor. Long live his lordship. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go. We'll take a putt in the car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's nobody more annoying to travel with than Bruce Jenner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Open thedoor, and let's get out of here.
