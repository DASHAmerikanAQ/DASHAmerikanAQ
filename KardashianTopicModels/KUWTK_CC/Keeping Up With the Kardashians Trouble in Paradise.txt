- Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely don't know what I think of Kris yet. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did that. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I really didn't try to flip you right there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I really want to renew our vows. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not a "renew your vows" kind of a girl. I just don't feel good about my body. I don't feel good about myself. You guys just don't understand. I just want to have a nice vacation with my husband. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you guys been drinking? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't need you giving me an attitude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've set the boundaries. He knows what his behavior has to be with me and what's 16 00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,367 acceptable and what's not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, am I not fine? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Good morning. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Is this for our room? Are you sure? For 322? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, that was nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourt wasn't pleased last night at all. But it's vacation. I want her to feel good. I really just want to smooth things over and just get back to being in a good place. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You ordered exactly what Mason wanted. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just wanted to end the trip on a nice note. &gt;&gt; MASON: Bah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bah. Obviously Scott is trying to make up, and setting up a breakfast definitely does not excuse his behavior. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know there's been a lot going on, a lot of drama. I think everybody's getting on each other's nerves. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I'm definitely ready to go home. &gt;&gt; ROB: They're taking the car. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Have you guys been enjoying your trip so far? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, very nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I think it's been very nice, and it's fun to see everybody else enjoying the trip along with us. Now, Kris, growing up, have you ever been camping? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't go camping. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, but Robert needs to hang out with guys that are on the right track. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I can't hang out with Rob too much. He's too into hookers. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, actually, it's the exact opposite. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think Robert's into hookers? &gt;&gt; KIM: Come on, Mom. Rob makes less money than Kendall. There is no way he could afford that. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, right now, I really don't have a lot going on, and, um, it sucks. I hear it all the time-- "loser this" from my sisters, from random people. 50 00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,572 I swear I feel like I'm going to explode. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm Rob. &gt;&gt; MAN: Rob? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MAN: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Scott. &gt;&gt; MAN: Nice to meet you, Scott. &gt;&gt; ROB: So what are these dudes you're doing business with? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's like a mixed drink in a bottle. &gt;&gt; ROB: So they're coming to this family anniversary vacation deal? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm going to take some meetings and stuff and do some business. &gt;&gt; ROB: I mean, that's kind of awkward. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I get that it's probably weird for you 'cause it's, like, a family vacation, but the truth is, money never sleeps and I got to make money while I can, buddy. &gt;&gt; ROB: I got you there. It's great to see how well Scott's doing lately and how he's just got a lot going on for himself. 67 00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:08,555 It also makes me realize I definitely need to step it up. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Are you on pace for Mason to be like five years old asking you for milk or what? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, you're not still breastfeeding, are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but I wish I was. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's a way to save money. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: 'Cause I heard she's cheap. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you know that Kourtney also still sleeps with Mason in the bed? He's like a year and a half years old, and he sleeps... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A year and a half years old? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't think we would ever do that with our kids. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't know. I've always thought, like, the... Is it called the Ferber Method, where you just let them cry it out? If you go pick him up every time he just makes a face, you're gonna be a slave your whole life to his demands. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and Kris-- they really should not be giving me any advice. They don't have kids. And how does he even know what the Ferber Method is? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All this baby talk is making me sick. It's, like, stressing me out. I'm, like, damn. What if we had a kid with us the whole time? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. Well, it will be like that one day if we ever... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Don't jump the gun, honey. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, it's so heavy. I got it together. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Party! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: While Rob's at the pool, Kylie and I decide to goof around and steal some of Rob's beers as a joke. I don't know which way it goes. It's one way. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh! I heard that. Ah! Wow! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. What's all the beer doing here? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What is this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's a bottle opener. Where did you guys get the beer? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Rob gave it to us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob gave it to you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He gave us that and all that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He gave you all that beer? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, that freak. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He really didn't. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, he did. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Say he didn't. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, he did it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He did. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why was Rob giving you beer. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: He said, throw a party. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just cannot believe that my little girls are trying to sneak beers on this trip. It's ridiculous. I'd better not catch you guys drinking beer. That's all I can say, all right? I've never seen you do it before, and you'd better not start now, okay? But if Rob's the one who gave 120 00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:36,369 these girls the beer, I will absolutely nail him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm pissed off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How could you let this happen?! Robert, are you gonna look at me? &gt;&gt; ROB: You're obnoxious. Who are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: You're a dick. a dick. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have no manners. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're a whore. You have no manners. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: If anyone else was talking to Kim like this, I would start swinging on him. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're being an ass 131 00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,789 &gt;&gt; ROB: I think you're a whore, and you should shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is all this beer on the table? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not mine. Robert gave it to Kendall and Kylie... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Robert gave beer... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...to Kendall and Kylie? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes. I'm just kind of pissed off. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How could you let this happen? I left for, what, a half an hour, an hour? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I wasn't here, either. Rob was doing it with the kids. I came in and saw the same thing! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That doesn't upset you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I already talked to the kids. Now you come in and start blowing up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob? Yeah, get over to my room right now. Who drank this one? Why is this one empty? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know who drank that one. There was a bunch of people in here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, maybe we'll find out now. Hi. If isn't that a handy-dandy bartender. What do you think you're doing giving your little sisters alcohol, Robert? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not even gonna defend myself right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob, I thought you would be an ally. You know that these girls-- they're 13 and 15 years old. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're supposed to be setting an example for them, Rob. Robert, are you going to look at me? This is not a joke. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well... &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is a very... This is big boy kind of a thing, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, well... &gt;&gt; KRIS: This isn't a child's game. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, Mom, I really thought you knew me better than that. I mean, I would think that my own parents would know me a lot better than that. I mean, I feel like my entire family is just attacking me this whole entire trip. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would think if they were drinking beer-- you're their big brother-- you would come to me and say, "Guess what? They're under age, and they're drinking beer." Okay? Be my little scout out there, watching out for these girls. &gt;&gt; ROB: As Bruce is screaming my head off, I begin to realize that Kendall and Kylie took my beer from my room and brought it to their room and threw me under the bus and blamed me, but you know, as their older brother, I'm gonna take the blame and kind of just go with it. All right, well... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't have a better explanation than that? That's how you're gonna leave it? Just, like, "Wow, Mom?" &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What'd you order? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is yours right there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at the little crabby. Ooh! That is so cute. Crab. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, look at him. I would feel really bad for him. This is just such a typical day of Rob. He's just so not motivated. Like, he... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: He should go get a real job. &gt;&gt; KIM: He wouldn't even survive. He can't commit. That's the problem. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Well, have Khloe put him out... &gt;&gt; ROB: I hear Kim, you know, badmouthing me and saying all these negative comments about me. You know, I take that personally. Thank God I have a sister who I can live with for now until I have a real job. I just fire back with whatever ammunition I got. Like, I'm just saying anything that I can think of to hurt her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, it was a huge hair. &gt;&gt; ROB: I want to actually focus on my career and stay in L.A. and work, not be out here on vacation, doing bullwhen I don't have a job. Doesn't make sense. It's kind of backwards, don't you think? I was doing this bullin college. Not focusing on my studies, not takingseriously. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I don't have a real job. &gt;&gt; ROB: My dad would never allow this &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Why are you acting like a brat, though? You could be thankful for your opportunities. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's your brat who... doesn't want to stay in a presidential suite. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Why would she be a brat 'cause she doesn't want to stay in the bigger room? &gt;&gt; KIM: I would have rather taken a smaller room for free. &gt;&gt; ROB: You complained right in front of the people that work so hard to pick flowers and put it on your bed and in your room and make it nice... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Not wanting something as extravagant does not make someone a brat. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, well, you're very disrespectful to say that in front of somebody. Dad raised you better than that. Mom raised you better than that. Bruce raised you better than that. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I think they'd all be very extremely proud of me. You, on the other hand... just look in the mirror. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Don't go anywhere. You started something. &gt;&gt; ROB: There's nothing to get started about, I wasn't trying to start anything-- it's just reality. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I can't tell if he's serious or not. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's serious, and he's an Maybe just smack him. You should've just stood up and told him he can't talk to me that way anymore. It would've scared him. Actually, he probably would've fought you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That'd be great. Rob doesn't have any respect for his sisters. You know, I have to say something to him-- you can't talk to Kim like this around me. Rob, we need to have a little conference. Come here, buddy. Listen to me, how you deal with your sister, like, in front of me, you're not gonna call her a bitch and &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't care. I will always call her that as long as she's disrespectful. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Well, then you got to deal with me... &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't want to be the guy that takes a knife and kills my sister's boyfriend. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: If it's got to go down like that, it's got to go down like that. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I just said Kim's... Kim's a bitch. And don't ever disrespect me and talk about how I'm a loser and I don't have a job, 'cause you say that to me on a daily... and you say that to everyone, Bible, on Dad, you definitely do. You probably say it maybe over 12 times a year. &gt;&gt; KIM: You said Dad would be so disappointed in our careers... &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I never did. I said, Bible, on Dad, I never said that. I said he would be disappointed in how you disrespected the hotel and how he would want me to go to grad school. I never did. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not our problem. We all think you're bipolar... &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, that's great. Then go to the doctor. I think you're a whore, and you should shut up. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: If anyone else was talking to Kim like this, it'd be on, you know? I would start swinging on him. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're obnoxious. Who are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: You're a dick. a dick. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have no manners. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're a whore. You have no manners. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're being an &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Look at me. Look at me, son. Say you're sorry. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think he wants to apologize. 264 00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,480 &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I will beat an apology out of you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're a dick. a dick. You're a whore. You have no manners. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm a whore? &gt;&gt; ROB: You just called me a dick, so I'm gonna say something right back. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's so immature. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yeah, I'm so immature. &gt;&gt; KIM: As a dad, you should step in, 'cause he's being disrespectful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go swim with the sharks. It'd be easier. &gt;&gt; KIM: We really need to talk to you about your son. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's he doing now? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, he's so crazy, Mom. Like, he's, I think he's bipolar. He comes over here and he just flips out on me, going, "You stupid bitch!" Like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? I don't know if he's bipolar or not, Kim, but he's definitely moody. I think you guys are overreacting, like, to the millionth degree. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: There was one Rob that I had a great time with, and I just met this other Rob just now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Welcome to the family. Wait, isn't that him? That's him. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's totally running right over there. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wait, are you okay with the fact if I put hands on your son? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I understand that Kris wants to defend Kim, which I think he should to some degree, but he really doesn't know the relationship that we all have together. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You need to give Rob some tough love. And I know we haven't known each other so long, but... you should just really snap on him and be serious about it and stick to it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? There you are. What's going on, Rob? &gt;&gt; ROB: I just can't, like, sit here anymore and just not do anything and vacation as a 24-year-old. Like, I don't enjoy sitting here and not having a career. All my friends are in law, you know? They're all going to grad school and they're doing all that. And that's what my dad did and that's what I would have wanted to do, but it's too late for that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's never too late to do what you want to do. You can do anything that you want to do that you put your mind to, but everybody struggles, everybody has disappointments, everybody has things that they have to get through, but if you really and truly want to go out and find something that you can be amazing at, then... you have to do that. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know what I want to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, but we're gonna figure that out. I wish I could tell you what it is, I wish I could hand it to you on a silver platter, but I can't. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just want you to be happy, and I want you to not... lash out at other people because you're angry. And I can't help it that your dad's not here and I can't help it that your sisters are doing something that you're not doing. As your mom, nothing is more upsetting... than having you unhappy. Honest to God. &gt;&gt; ROB: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you so much. I just want you to be okay. Okay? &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. 325 00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,705 &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Does someone have scissors? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who does this to you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Who does what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That alteration. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I said, "Do it tighter, do it tighter." Wait, look, Kourtney has some scissors right here. Kourt, will you cut up a slit up the back on the seam? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that Gucci? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But you want it cut? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I don't know if I can get into the boat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just wear it-- have Kris carry you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wouldn't cut it. It's Gucci. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, can I just talk to you for a second? Robert, go get in the boat. I sat down and had a heart-to-heart with your brother, and I think what you guys don't understand is, he's really hurting inside, and he doesn't mean to come out with some of the things that he says, and we need to be really kind and loving to him tonight, because he needs us right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Look over here, Mase. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, guys. &gt;&gt; MAN: All right, welcome back to Bloody Mary's. Now, first of all, these are gonna be your appetizer choices here in the middle. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Tough to sit in. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, poor big guy, doesn't fit at the table. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, I wanted to apologize for our argument that we had earlier. I feel like I said some really mean things. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, I don't like to hear that stuff, and you constantly say, "You're... My brother's a loser." I just need to figure out what I want to do when I get back to L.A. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bottom line, I love you, and I don't think that you're a loser or any of the things that I might have said. I obviously don't mean them... and I don't think that of you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Um... well, I appreciate you apologizing. And I'm sorry as well. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I know Rob's going through a tough time, and he's, like, in that phase where he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life, and I know my comments and what I say to him really doesn't help the situation. Rob is my only brother. Like, I love him to death. Like, I want him to succeed. Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, I want to make a toast. I know that we fight from time to time, but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No! &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...at the end of the day, I'm so happy that we're all here together. So let's have a great last few days on our vacation. 374 00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:58,251 Love you guys. Whoo! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is this? It looks like Mason pooped. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, it's not poop, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you sure? Ew, you're touching it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's, like, a filler. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, Dad, me and Kylie want to talk to you guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: About what? What'd we do now? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You'll see. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: About how much you love us? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm really surprised that Rob did cover for us. He is a great brother, and I feel like I shouldn't have thrown him under the bus. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We... thought it would be funny to bring beer into the room and to open some and blame it on Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So what you guys are trying to say was that was a joke? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It kind of turned into a whole different op... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, it did, because it made me really change my opinion of who I thought I raised for 24 years. I am so angry at Kendall and Kylie, because the last thing that Rob needed right now was somebody blaming him for something that he didn't do. Then why didn't Robert just tell us the truth? That's what I don't get. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think he thought that we were actually drinking, so he wanted to cover for us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's why we put such an emphasis on health and fitness and keeping you guys busy and telling you that drugs and alcohol are a really bad thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, don't tell me okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, we're getting too dramatic over this thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not getting dramatic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's the bottom line-- you're not gonna grow up too fast. I know you're around adults all the time, but you just can't do those things. Okay, we're working on you getting your driver's license. Okay, you-- you still got to grow up. And you guys actually should apologize to Rob. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is that, Mase? What is Mommy doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come on. agua? Agua. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When you guys were fighting, I heard. It seemed like I might have to, you know, punch Rob or whatever, but I... &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I think he was joking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. Kim and Rob are obviously going to make up, and then, that's gonna leave Kris and Rob in a fight, and maybe something that can never be forgiven. What would you do if he did that and had, like, a girl come up to you and say, "I just want you to know if you say that kind of stuff to Rob in front of me, I'm going to have to punch you next time," or something? You would be, like, "Who the hell are you? Don't ever come around me again." If Rob says something to Kris, then Kris can say something. But if you Rob and you are fighting, it's between you two. It's not between him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. No, I will. Even though I told him to stand up to Rob, I just really think that I need to have a talk with Kris and just kind of explain to him the family dynamic. That even though it seems really crazy, and we might be fighting, it's not really that serious. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, my friends. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, buddy. &gt;&gt; SHANE: Hey, mate. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; SHANE: Hey, so good to see you again. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, I realize that I'm on vacation, but the businesses that I'm doing at home can't just stop because I'm on vacation, so I decided to take a couple meetings with a vodka company that I'm involved in. Again, I can't believe you guys actually came out here to take care of business, but I'm very appreciative. &gt;&gt; SHANE: Cheers, mate. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Glad to be in business with you fellas. &gt;&gt; SHANE: Hey... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's have a cocktail for a healthy relationship. &gt;&gt; MAN: Cheers, guys. &gt;&gt; SHANE: Yes. &gt;&gt; MAN: To a great business relationship. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: To a very nice, healthy, long business. &gt;&gt; SHANE: Nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's refreshing, especially for here. &gt;&gt; SHANE: It's perfect. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Perfect. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Who is it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall, get that, please. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm in the middle of sleeping. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just get the door, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God! &gt;&gt; ROB: Freaking storm out there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I know. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Robert... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Rob! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Robert, give me a hug. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob, the girls told me that they were the ones responsible for the beer, not you. Why were you trying to cover for them? &gt;&gt; ROB: 'Cause I don't want these little brats to get in trouble. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you guys have something to say to Robert? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm sincerely sorry from the bottom of my heart. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you sure it'll never happen again? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. I felt bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bottom line is, is Rob-- he's a good big brother. I thought it was awfully nice of him and gentlemanly-like, covering for the girls. He didn't want them to get in trouble. Classy act, Rob. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys, you don't throw your brother under the bus like that again. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're supposed to have each other's backs, okay? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We're sorry. &gt;&gt; ROB: We're sorry. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're sorry. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie's kicking your butt. &gt;&gt; ROB: She's... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: One 13-year-old girl, and you can't get up? That's sad, Rob. 478 00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:45,805 I think she kicks your butt. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, Kylie. &gt;&gt; ROB: Dude, I honestly can't do the whole hair thing for much longer. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, you need to stop worrying about just getting your hair, like, shaped up. First of all, your hair is short right now. Do you know what I have to deal with this mane? &gt;&gt; ROB: But your hair's not that long on sides, is it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, but it has some depth that you're not aware of, because it goes straight back. Come on down. Hey, Humphy. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm still really pissed about the way Rob treated Kim. I just felt uncomfortable, disrespected. You know, it took every ounce of me not to just put hands on him, basically. Look at me, son. Say you're sorry. I will beat an apology out of you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SHANE: I'm Shane. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's the owner of the vodka company I'm investing in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is the worst idea I have ever heard in my entire life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think that you're drinking more than you say you're drinking. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like, do you just write down all the reasons to pick at Scott? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How annoying can you be? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's unbelievable. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Look at me, son. Say you're sorry. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think he wants to apologize. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't want to apologize. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: No, you will, or I'll beat that out of you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not sure he's sorry about... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I will beat an apology out of you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Say you're sorry. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I understand, you know, you and Kim have your thing, and you know, your family's been through a lot, and you know, I would probably never understand that, not having gone through it, but, um, just around me, try to keep it cool. &gt;&gt; ROB: Keep it PG? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. It's tough for me to sit there and watch that. Makes me just want to swing on you. &gt;&gt; ROB: I apologize to her. I apologize to everybody, so... I understand. My anger just gets to the next level. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Give me the apology. &gt;&gt; ROB: I apologize for being disrespectful. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But not to you, he said. 525 00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,021 &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, you can leave. Him and I are gonna hang out. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's something that I kind of want to talk to you about. I love... the way you are. Like, I love everything about you, and I think you're perfect. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wait. What kind of talk is this right now? &gt;&gt; KIM: I so appreciated that you stood up for me, because Rob was being really disrespectful, but basically, Kourtney came up to me and said, "Maybe that's just, like, a little too soon for him to be, like, jumping into, like, our family arguments." Maybe let's try and win the family over first before just hitting them all with all these crazy things that you say. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Right. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I know Kim's family's very important to her, and part of my goal is to, like, really bond with them, and I think when the family gets to know me, they'll understand my sense of humor. I know that you have an interesting dynamic, and I've been kind of figuring it out, but I'll win them over. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know you will. Besito. Besito. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's up? That's Star Tours. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hello. Hello. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, amigos. &gt;&gt; ROB: What's that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How much? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Did you make that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is there a basketball? &gt;&gt; ROB: Throw me a... Throw me a ball. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. We got Rob K here. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hey, where'd you get that beer? Where'd you get that 40 ounce? I want to bond with Rob for Kim, 'cause I feel like I should get along with her family. And one... three. It's not like I have to try hard. That's what guys do. Bonding with someone is, like, an easy thing. Money ball. Come on. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kris asked me to play ball, and of course, I'm gonna take him up on that, 'cause I'm better than him. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Game. It's over. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, Rob. Did you know I can dunk? &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, Kris-- he really is a good dude. My sister loves the guy. She's happier than ever, and it's good to see her happy. 568 00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,850 &gt;&gt; KIM: Boom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Family vacation, but I got to work some times. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's it going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just doing a little island shopping. &gt;&gt; SHANE: You've done well. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: These are my two friends that I'm doing business with that came into town to take a meeting. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is Shane. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. How are you? Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SHANE: I'm Shane... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's the owner of the vodka company I'm investing in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott has a lot of nerve doing this and planning this while we're on my vacation. This is the worst idea I have ever heard in my entire life. Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are these vodka guys on my vacation? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Vodka? Are they here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, Scott's outside with the vodka people. Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott always has a million deals going on, and I had no idea that it was for a 588 00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:38,597 vodka company. I'm gonna have to talk to him. Hey, what are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't worry about it, sweetheart. 592 00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:52,377 &gt;&gt; ROB: Let's go lay outside. Here. Come on, Kourt. &gt;&gt; ROB: Get your own. I got... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, we ordered enough. &gt;&gt; ROB: You just get your own plate, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want some food. &gt;&gt; ROB: No. I'm eating. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shrimp cocktail, isn't it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew! Ooh. Ooh, is that real? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here, Kim. Here's your lunch. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it alive? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's alive! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I found a live crab, and I was talking to Rob and Scott, and we all agreed that it would be really funny to prank Kim. I always find that if you mutually prank one person, it brings the whole group together. Damn, girl. In an emergency situation, though, she can react. Oh, she didn't lock this door all the way. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just really glad that Kris is bonding with the whole family. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Don't you want lunch? &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, it's, like, at my expense, but I'd rather that and just have everyone have a good time. No... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: He's nice, he's nice. He's nice! &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you doing that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? I think Kris is a really great guy, and I think he's bringing out the best side of Kim. I've never seen her laugh so hard. Kim can be a little uptight, and she's learning how to really loosen up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have them go over. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You want to come have lunch? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Broke a full sweat to try to scare you, baby. 628 00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,502 &gt;&gt; KIM: And you did. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so excited that we're going to have a family dinner tonight on another island. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's throw out the bumper. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at the fishies, Mase, fish. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got some fishies in there. See the fishies? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Masey, Mase, look. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason, what does a fish do? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He knows he's cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. That looks beautiful. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yo. Did you guys figure out getting the boat to the hotel? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who's he talking to? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What'd Shane say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Some business partner. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Wait, hold on, I didn't hear you. What were you saying? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott gets a phone call at dinner, and I overhear that it's from his vodka partner. I can't help myself. I have to say something. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, perfect. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think it's a good idea to have a vodka-based nutritional drink if you're trying not to drink? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll have a vodka here and there. I just don't really drink now to get drunk. I just drink to have a drink or two just to relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You were drinking to get a buzz on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Why are you even drinking? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna go have a quick smoke. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where is he going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll be right back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing, coming down here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just wanted to say your vodka deal... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know, I just don't want to ever get back to that place that we were at. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Have I not drank completely responsible? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just saying that you're starting to drink a little bit more and a little bit more. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't worry about me. I do everything you ask for. I made up with your brother when he was being immature. Everything you ever ask, I do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, but I'm saying, I think that you're drinking more than you say you're drinking. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, it's unbelievable. Like, do you just write down all the reasons to pick at Scott every day? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, how annoying could you be? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Un--believable. It's suchbull It's almost as if I'm on house arrest every day of my life. I am not doing anything wrong, I am being responsible. People need to take a step back and let me just proceed with my life. Can you bring me back to the hotel? &gt;&gt; DRIVER: Yes, what about the others? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nah, forget about them. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is everything okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's just annoying sometimes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Should we get going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, Masey needs to go home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where'd Scott go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. He was having a cigarette. I think he's probably on the dock waiting for us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where is Scott? Where's our boat? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No way he would take the boat and go back to the hotel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott left us here stranded on this island? This is just typical Scott behavior. He goes a few feet forward and 12 steps back. &gt;&gt; MAN: The desire to spend the rest of your life together... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Standing here being a part of the Jenners' life and I'm thinking I want to have a moment like that with Kim. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not the end of the world if I want to have a cocktail or two responsibly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is the end of the world if it turns out of control. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course, but that's not what's happening. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott knows what his behavior has to be with me and what's acceptable and what's not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Will someone just hold Mase while I get off? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good night, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got you. Here's Mase. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Tell Scott we really appreciated that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Of course. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good night, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good night. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come on, baby. You just leave us stranded like that? We all had to wait there for the boat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why would I leave you stranded? I took a boat home and I'm sure it came back for you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're so selfish. There's all these other people waiting for the boat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How am I selfish? 'Cause I wanted to get out of there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're one person. You could have waited on the dock and waited till we came back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, what, did you guys have to wait five minutes? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We had to wait about 15 minutes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 15 minutes? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, the world should stop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All I'm saying is that you were being selfish. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I go to anger management, and that anger management therapist has told me numerous times, if I'm in a place where I need to take myself out of, do so so nothing else happens, and right there was a perfect example. I needed to get out of there. Nagging me and getting on me for every single thing and babysitting me and treating me like a child-- that's selfish. You don't know how hard it is for me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's not selfish. That's called "I need to do what's best for me and Mason," and having a... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. Okay, that right there is being selfish. You need to do what's best for you and Mason? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What about us as a family? I have been under control, but you always want to make me feel like I'm some psychotic animal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whatever, I'm over this conversation. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean you're...? Oh, you're over it. And who's being selfish now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, come here. We're going to go to bed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go, buddy. âŞ Oh, my little buddy My buddy, my buddy My little buddy Mason. âŞ That's a golf cart over there. Yeah, the boats are out there. Yeah, they're on the water. Well, I don't see any right now. todo, todo. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott made it to breakfast, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is he not going to sit at our table? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who knows? He is such a drama queen. It's ridiculous to be avoiding each other. I am going to be the bigger person and go over and talk to Scott. I mean, we are a family. I think that we need to go home and talk to our therapist because I did set boundaries of what was acceptable and not acceptable. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm a good dad, I'm a good boyfriend. It's not the end of the world if I want to have a cocktail or two responsibly. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is the end of the world if it turns out of control. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course, but that's not what's happening. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, but just remember the place that you were in in Miami and that if it ever gets even close to that, even halfway back to that... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott knows what his behavior has to be with me and what's acceptable and what's not, so I just have to trust that he'll do the right thing. That's all I can do. 767 00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,723 I cannot live my life controlling him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, we're gonna go put our swim trunks on. &gt;&gt; ROB: We'll be right back. Hey, I'm gonna go put on my swim trunks. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I was gonna say, can you order food if you're gonna go down there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I ordered food for-- to the room. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, we're gonna go to the pool to eat lunch like we just planned. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, let us just change real quick, come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mason's sleeping, so why do you have to change? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 'Cause I want to put a bathing suit on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so hurry. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, forget it, then. Lunch is off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're such a loser. Be quiet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Shut theup. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm saying, be quiet when you go in. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Really, shut the up while you're at it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, cool. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Annoying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you had these? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What was that whole Scott, uh...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: His pet peeve is when you call him a loser. He, like, cringes. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: So, wait, you-- knowing that, you still called him a loser? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, I don't even care, I'm just-- it's fun to call him a loser. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All I see when I look at Scott is just a, a really good dad, nice guy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Fun to be around, so... that's all I can judge him off of. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's all those. I mean, I didn't have the best thoughts about Kris coming onto this vacation, but just seeing Kris defend Scott was a really nice thing. I think it's easy for him to just agree with me and say, "Oh, you're right, Scott is such a loser," and it really makes me 800 00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:52,117 realize that he fits well into our family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God, look at you in white. Don't you look cute? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm outdoing the bride, I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You are outdoing the bride. Let's go, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. The whole reason that we're here in Bora Bora is to celebrate our 20th anniversary, and Bruce has this big renewal of the vows ceremony planned, and I'm excited, but I hope he doesn't have anything else up his sleeve. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoo! You made it. &gt;&gt; MAN: The desire to spend rest of your lives together as friends, lovers, companion and protectors, and all things that embody this institution of holy matrimony. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 20 years ago, I said to you: "With this ring, I thee wed." Would you please give me your left hand? Okay. And so, close your eyes. No peeking. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Don't peek. ring, I would like to thank you for the 820 00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:57,148 last 20 years and look forward to the next 20 years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... my... God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't swear. We're at a wedding. Don't swear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do I get to keep this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, you get to keep it. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: So, I'm standing here being a part of the Jenners' life, and I'm thinking, 828 00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,538 I want to have a moment like that with Kim. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! Down one. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm not even thinking about golf. I'm just thinking, there's something really important that I have to ask Bruce. I wanted to come to you first... 834 00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,624 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: ...and ask you... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Kim, I have a surprise for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: A surprise? What kind of surprise? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm not gonna tell you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Babe, what kind of surprise? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm not telling you. &gt;&gt; KIM: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Just let's go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are we going? Is this okay to where? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Keep your eyes shut-- it's a surprise. Just walk straight. I will not lead you astray. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Look, baby. Remember when we talked about going on a sailboat? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you gonna sail? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do we take our shoes off? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, please. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, this is so cool. Where did you find this? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I did some investigating in town today. &gt;&gt; KIM: We could lay here. I have to admit, I was so nervous when you said you were gonna come on this trip, because you meet the family for the first time-- it's, like, really overwhelming, you know? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Just being with them all at once, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm really glad that you got along with everyone. I've had, like, a few freak-outs, like with the earring and fighting with my brother. Like, if anything, I think that, like, you bring out the better side of me and, like, have shown me not to really freak out. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I mean, if that's the worst thing that I see, I'm okay with that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you have fun? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I had a great time. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so pretty. This is so nice. It just feels sort of incomplete. I really miss Khloe. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe who? missing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe Kardashian Odom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have another sister?! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You've been hiding this?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Holy Chi... cago! We have another sister! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys have another sister no one knows about? &gt;&gt; OTHERS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That is unreal. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I could believe it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are Kim and Kris really not coming? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. They went sailing. I think that it's been kind of fun spending some time with Kris, and seeing how him and Kim are together. What do you guys think? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Tons of fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just think it's really cute the way that him and Kim are together. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, I love the bruises that I have on myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But he's kind of lovable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He is a nice guy, though. I like that I was talking to him about Scott, 'cause Scott was annoying, and he could've talked about Scott, 'cause I was, but he totally defended him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I think he has a good sense of humor. And he tries to make everybody laugh, but he definitely makes her happy. I'm definitely a lot more comfortable with Kris than I was before we went on this trip, because I didn't know him at all. I get now how Kim is head over heels for this guy. Who knows, he might be the one. So you're excited to get back to L.A. so we can... get to work on what your real passion is? &gt;&gt; ROB: I feel like I want to get back to L.A. I'm excited and anxious to, like, figure out kind of a career path, which direction I want to take. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's amazing. Cheers, Rob. I'm gonna help you do that. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well... yeah. And, I mean, honestly, I really would consider porn. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get it on camera? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Starring Robert Kardashian. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, no, no, I would direct, but I would do, like, one just to kind of get my... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just to jump it off. &gt;&gt; ROB: ...get my... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thrower, not a shower! Volume one! &gt;&gt; ROB: Scotty! Let's go! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's a rainbow-- not a big one. Look. In the sky. &gt;&gt; ROB: You love rainbows! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's never seen one before. This whole Bora Bora experience for me was just fabulous, to spend this much time with the family. Yeah, we have our little family problems and issues and everything, but overall, I think it was a big success. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was the most amazing trip. I actually forgot how much fun it was to be trapped on a desert island with my kids. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kardashians are leaving Bora Bora! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It just exceeded every single one of my expectations. Ah! Hey, doll. Did you have a good time? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I had a great time. It was a lot of fun getting to know your family and amazing spending a week straight with Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've never seen her so happy. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: That's good. That's nice to hear. All right, thanks for having me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks for coming. I'm really happy for Kris and Kim, because they seemed to have a really good time on the trip. And who knows, maybe one day they'll be back here again, and Kim and Kris will be celebrating 20th anniversary. You've actually got a keeper. &gt;&gt; KIM: In what, Mase? Of course we do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, in Kris. I think he's a really great guy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, honey, I've known that a long time ago. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have to give it to you this time-- you picked a good one. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I feel like I'm gonna get my shirt filthy dirty by putting this strap on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just put the damn strap on it. You're hanging around the girls too much. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I had a great time in Bora Bora, and I feel like I'm becoming part of this family. I'm going out golfing with Bruce; I know that's his thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get your sand wedge. Do I have to coach you, too? Basketball players-- they can't play golf. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm playing like crap, I'm nervous... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! Down one. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm not even thinking about golf. I'm just thinking, there's something really important that I have to ask Bruce. The real question is, you're wondering why we came out here. I wanted to come to you first... 954 00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,985 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: ...and ask you... 957 00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:53,431 access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Bad, but I'm not the worst player ever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, no. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm playing like crap, I'm nervous... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! Down one. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm not even thinking about golf. I'm just thinking, there's something really important that I have to ask Bruce. Bruce... the real question is, you're wondering why we came out here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh. Why? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: 'Cause, man, I, uh... I wanted to come to you first. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: ...and ask you... uh, if I can marry Kim. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so exciting! How are we asking Kim to marry us? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Us? &gt;&gt; KIM: You're gonna have to get a nicer place. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit. You're not in touch with reality. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's not true. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's true. This is the biggest moment 979 00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,848 in my life.
