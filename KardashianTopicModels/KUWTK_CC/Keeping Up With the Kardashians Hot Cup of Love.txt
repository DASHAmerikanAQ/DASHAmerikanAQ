- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't leave. I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't care. I don't care. I'm tired. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, we're just playing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe, stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're just playing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe, she's pregnant. Can you just get your hands off her? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't touch her! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Khloe! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not even funny. I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt! Kourt! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just get away from us! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, honestly, he grabbed Kourtney. I was-- it's my sister. &gt;&gt; KIM: He just went, "Come on," like this. He didn't go, "Get over here, woman." &gt;&gt; ROBERT: We had such a nice dinner, then you justit all up. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ROYA: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, to anybody like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just coming to get my stuff. I'm just going to work from home today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe's psycho, and I don't want to see her. She's, like... Last night, like, literally slaps Scott across his face. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I knew she was mad at Scott, but I never expected that she would really take out everything she had inside and hit him. Kourtney, what did Scott say though? I mean, was he...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nothing. He wasn't doing anything. They were just playing around, but then she, like, took it to the next level. Khloe hitting Scott totally crossed the line. I don't want anything to do with her right now. I don't want to look at her. I don't want to talk to her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm tired of everybody fighting. I'll go talk to her. This is just something that really needs my attention right now, and I'm going to have to step in and see if I can get the two of them to work it out. Hey, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello, gov'ner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nothing. It's hot in here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, I need to talk to you about something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just heard that you slapped Scott last night. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. It's not even that big of a deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, it is a big deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't care how mad you are at somebody, you don't hit somebody. That's abusive. You know, I know that he's not the idea situation... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...but he is a part of our family. It's going to be a different dynamic between you and Kourtney, because there's going to be a baby. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love that it's so easy to preach when you're the one that is so mean to Scott. You yell at him every second. And now that I get angry one time 'cause he grabbed me for grabbing <i>my</i> sister, you're going to now criticize me and blame me for something? That's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look how angry you're getting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My whole family is so hypocritical. Everyone's pointing the finger at me for slapping Scott. I'm just doing what they all wish they would do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you work on your anger and I'll try and work on mine, and we'll change our attitudes together. Happy family. &gt;&gt; LISA: What's going on with Khlo since the wedding? I haven't even seen her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's really good for Khloe to kind of be away from Kourtney a little bit. Khloe needs to concentrate on being married and being a newlywed and making babies. &gt;&gt; LISA: Oh, God. Talking about sex-- do you remember I told you I went to Betsy's birthday dinner? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LISA: The party favors, you're going to die. These were at every one of our seats. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is it? &gt;&gt; LISA: They're little male enhancement sex pills. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... sex pills. &gt;&gt; LISA: I am not kidding you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I thought my friends were crazy. Lisa's friends gave out organic male enhancement pills that, I guess you can buy over the counter. &gt;&gt; LISA: I wouldn't mind trying it. I mean... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce is never going to go for this. &gt;&gt; LISA: Just take it. Just take it. All I want to know is, I want a report afterwards. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A report? &gt;&gt; LISA: Yeah. And I'll give you one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stand by for that. You might be waiting a really long time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll wear it. No. I think it'll... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whose is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's mine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Unh-uh, it's Kim's. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I took it. She doesn't need another one. She'll never know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, did you really take-- I knew you took it from Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're so evil. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kourt. I'm with Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, we're going to leave here in about 15 minutes and go to the sale at Barney's. You want to go with us? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, no, thanks. I'm... have-- really busy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have been so MIA lately. What the hell is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why would you think I would want anything to do with you? You slapped Scott across the face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are Sensitive Sally. Seriously, calm down. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right. Have fun. I'm super busy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's really serious. Right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney has never spoken to me this way. I don't want to apologize to Scott, but I know the only way I can hang out with Kourtney again is if I apologize. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Scott. Can I come in? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I came here to talk to you in person. Hey, Kourt. I came here to apologize about what happened. I mean, honestly, I think we all overreacted. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I overreacted, Khloe? I wasn't the one assaulting people, if you don't remember. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I felt like you were invading my space with my sister. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Invading your space? You physically attacked me. Until you do something, I don't need you around me or around her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's brainwashing you... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's not brainwashed! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are disgusting and you're going way too overboard. I have to go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you hit somebody else that wasn't me, you could get sued. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, shut up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Shut up? Why don't you get mad again? Go hitting somebody! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know I probably shouldn't do this. If I put one little pill in his coffee, what's the harm? Hey, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good morning. Hey, how's it going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here, honey. Here's your coffee. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Good morning! Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, what are you guys going to have-- bagels? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You guys want to go to the mall today? Is that what you want to do? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: Actually, I do. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: We're all going to the mall. We're all going to the mall. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendal and Kylie, they're growing up. If I want to spend time with my little girls, now teenagers, where do I go? To the mall. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey. Why would you clean the pool if we have a pool man? What's going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I help you clean the pool? I have a little bit of time before I go to the mall. Let's see if this pill even works. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What, are you into the pool guy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you into the pool thing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a pool man fantasy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. You want to play "I'm the housewife and you're the pool man"? Huh? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think that might work out very well. Yeah, that's... Maybe we should. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We've got 20 minutes. I've got to take a shower. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Longer than that. I'm in no rush. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah?! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: We're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, Rob, give me five more minutes. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What are you guys taking so long for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob, go away! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: The kitchen's on fire. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? What?! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: What do you mean what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're busy, Rob. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll tell you what-- why don't you take them? Rob, here's a credit card. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: You guys are bad people. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So how's everything going? What's going on, everybody? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We've been good. Everything's good except your one psychotic daughter, Khloe. She's, like, angry at the world. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's not angry at the world. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do miss Khloe, though. I'm just over this whole drama and fighting. I just want to get it resolved and have it back to normal. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's just, you know, this, like, separation between the two of them, and I think they miss each other. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So has anybody talked to Khloe? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, she tried to come to our house and apologize, but I just said until she got, like, help, I don't want her around me or her. I think she needs to go to some kind of anger management. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's crazy. She does not need anger management. She was just, like, drunk and just messing around with you... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And you think that's fine just to go around being like that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I understand where Scott is coming from. I mean, he's just trying to figure out a way to set boundaries with Khloe, and let her see that there's consequences for her actions. I'll tell her that, you know, maybe it would be a good idea to kind of mend this rift you guys have going on. And maybe it wouldn't hurt her to go to a class. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Perfect. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Done. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Done. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Done. I'm such a genius. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's eat. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's eat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, thank you for a special day today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know what it is about Kris, but she's acting pretty hot. She wants it in the kitchen! What? &gt;&gt; KENDAL: What do you mean what?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is it that I'm feeling a little dirty right now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's good, honey. I like dirty! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come over here and sit down with me. I want to have a talk with you. Anybody who knows Khloe, knows that she's not going to do anything she doesn't want to do. Now, it's my job as her mom to convince Khloe to go to anger management. Kim and I decided that we wanted to have a talk with you. Listen, you and Kourtney out of everybody in our family are the two closest. And I really need you to help me fix the piece in the family. And maybe you should just consider making everybody happy and going to, like, an anger management program. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe is, like, MIA. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm still here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just miss my sister. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: I think the next step is going to be for you to go into the emergency room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel so guilty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is about as dumb as you've gotten so far. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe you should just consider going to, like, an anger management program. I know it sounds stupid, but if you just go along with them and just go one time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, fine. I'll go to anger management if that means everyone will shut up about this and move on, and it will make everybody happy. Honestly, thisI have to do in this family is "ridic." &gt;&gt; KIM: You just are too strong for your own good. Like, you just don't even know. Like, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel so guilty, but Bruce and I are having so much fun. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Morning, Mother. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Rob. Are you hungry, sweetie? You want some breakfast? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Yes, please. You're making such a nice breakfast, Mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's starving. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: 'Cause you guys have been boning so much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob! Rob! Rob! Rob! Rob! It's not cool to be talking to your mother like this. Come on. Just go get dressed. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Okay, thanks. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, honey, I have your coffee. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can you measure me? Waist? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want me to measure you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, get a measuring tape. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll go grab one. Got one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Duh, what the is that? You need, like, a fabric one. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is what I use. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine, let's just try it. Oh, you're worthless. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's worth...? I was sleeping. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is what I need Khloe for, and Khloe is, like, MIA. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm still here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sitting here reading a million baby books all morning. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just miss my sister. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: So I wake up from a nap and my penis is And this would not go away. I don't know why I can't control myself right now. I haven't had an erection problem since I was in middle school. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob, where are you? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Mom. Mom, don't come in here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt;ROBERT: Mom, don't come in here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Shut the door, please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Rob, you're acting really bizarre. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I call Scott out of all people, because I just could not tell my Mom, 'cause that's just plain awkward. I have aand it will not go away. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you're kidding and I get there and you're sitting... &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I'm not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...there with a dildo or something weird, I'm not into it. I'm tired. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: This is probably one of the most embarrassing things that could ever happen to me, considering I live in a house with my mother and two little sisters. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's the problem? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Scotty. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ew! &gt;&gt; ROBERT: It doesn't look bad right now. I've beenfor two hours at least. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You've got to go to the doctor. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: The only doctor I know is my pediatrician. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Just relax. Does that hurt when I push? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: No. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: No. Okay. Can you cough for me? The good news is, you know, nothing is turning black and blue. I think the next step is going to be for you to go into the hospital and go into the emergency room. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Once I hear that I may need to go to the hospital, I definitely need Scott to call my mother. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I get a call from Scott telling me he's got to take Rob to the doctor. I'm supposed to be with Khloe and Bruce, and I'm just going to have everyone meet there. We're going straight to the doctor's, so I can make sure that Robert's going to be okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, death! Just come on, Robert. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So, how did this all start? Did you... wake up with it? Did you... &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I literally took a nap, woke up and that was it. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: So you're sure you haven't taken any erectile dysfunction medications and that stuff that you see? You know, the Viagras or Levitras? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I haven't taken anything. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: The doctor gave me some extra strength Tylenol. And he said if it doesn't go down in the next 24 hours, then you definitely need to go the hospital. He said that obviously I took some kind of drug, and I haven't. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What kind of a drug? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: An erectile dysfunctional... &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's definitely something wrong with my son. I'm thinking maybe Rob drank Bruce's coffee. Is there a way I could have a little chat with the doctor? &gt;&gt; RECEPTIONIST: Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, thanks. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Yeah, that's the idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If he was to have taken some kind of a drug... Like one of those things that you take to get, you know, like, a Viagra-- one of those kind of things. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: At least that would give us an explanation. Um, if this doesn't go away on its own, then... probably gonna go to the hospital. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get it checked out. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Get it checked out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I realize that now I have to tell Robert and Bruce what's really going on. And this is going to be really, really hard for me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, we're out of here. All right, did you pay for it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, before you go, this isn't easy for me to say. I think that he might've accidentally drank some coffee that I had intended for you to drink. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That had a little, kind of, like, a male enhancement, little drug thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You've got to be kidding me? What the hell are you doing? Honey... you are a smart lady. Okay? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But sometimes you do the dumbest things. And this is about as dumb as you've gotten so far. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I feel like I should be really pissed at her. But I mean, this is, like, so ridiculous, I don't even know how to feel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You weren't having fun the last couple of days? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can we just go home? Let's go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Leave her alone. Stop it. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: Welcome to Daybreak Counseling Service. What brings you to the class? So what are you guys doing tonight? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: She's going to... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have anger management. &gt;&gt; KIM: Anger management? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Anger management. : "Hi, my name is Khloe." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're coming with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're the one that decided that I have to go, so you're coming with. Kim is definitely going with me to anger management. If I have to go through this, so does she. I'm not going to be miserable alone. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're taking me with you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're going to throw out your back right now. Where are you taking her? Are you taking her... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye, you guys. Have fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom! My shoe! : Help! Mom! Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Leave her alone. Leave her alone! &gt;&gt; KIM: My hair! Ow! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. Rocky, stop it. &gt;&gt; MAN:People cut me off, I want to run them down sometimes. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: Okay, tell me what would you like to do? &gt;&gt; WOMAN:, get your ass up out of here! &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: Okay. All right. That's aggressive communication. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Things got heated, and I just started throwing shoes. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: Okay. Just have a seat right here, please. Thank you. Right on time. Welcome to Daybreak Counseling Service. This is an anger management class. What brings you to the class? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Um, because I got into a fight with my sister's boyfriend. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: Tell me about this fight. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's a douche-lord and I hit him. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: Okay, one of the things that we always say in the class is that "anger is a secondary emotion." So what I want you to do... Come up for a second. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The teacher wants to do a demonstration where Kimberly pretends to be Scott and I am myself. And I have to verbalize my feelings to Scott. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: So tell Scott basically how you feel. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like you are a major douche-lord. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: Okay. You're not telling Scott how you feel inside about... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my emotions. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: Your emotions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like you're taking my sister away from me. &gt;&gt; Okay, so what does that do to you inside? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel... it hurts me. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: How would you respond to that? &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, he would just probably be, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Denial. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: And that's perfect, because this formula doesn't change Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: What it did, it changed how you interacted with Scott. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: During this class, I'm realizing that, you know, my anger that I have for Scott is not really about him. It's about the fact that I feel like I'm losing Kourtney, and I feel like she's being taken away from me. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: Do you miss your sister? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: You feel that loss? I'm wondering what are you willing to do to bring her in? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Try a little harder and not ignore him. But I don't necessarily have to go out of my way to be nice to him. Just be nice enough to make her feel comfortable. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; COUNSELOR: Okay. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's called your job being a woman. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's called... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Cooking and cleaning. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: See if that ever happens. I will spray thisright on your face, and I know how much you hate grease. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The door is... come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hurry, you'd better watch out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just make me food! Ay! Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How's it going? What's going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I did take your advice. I did go to anger management. And now totally get that I handled it wrong. And I almost feel, or felt, like, almost like you were taking Kourtney away from me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I understand what it must be like for you to not have Kourtney every day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're not Siamese twins. We can't be together all the time. I'm married now. She's having a baby. But I do want you to know that I am sorry and I won't hit you anymore. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I appreciate it. As long as you realize that... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aw... how cute! We're all friends again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm really glad that I went to anger management class. I don't want to hit Scott anymore. I love Kourt and I want to be with her, so therefore... And I promise to never slap him again, unless he does something really bad. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, bring it in for the real thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I barely hugged you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're all friends. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Only Khloe and I know what the bunny hop is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know what the bunny hop is, honey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you don't know what it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I invented the bunny hop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you don't know what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Kris. We just had some coffee of yours that you made us earlier. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: So I decided I'm, I'm going to forgive my mom, but I'm still going to have my fun with her and give her a hard time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's so weird, I just had some coffee. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: I don't know what it was, but all of a s... &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROBERT: All of a sudden, I drank something, and my... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I thought it was decaf. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: ...my penis turned green. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Robert, stick that back in there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I found your, uh, magic pills. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What is this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, I'm sorry. You're great with or without the pills. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Apology accepted. Everybody, let's eat. Just watch out for the coffee. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Next on <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>With the Kardashians:</i> &gt;&gt; KRIS: Reggie, it feels really good to have you back. &gt;&gt; KIM: Reggie and I don't ever want to be away from each other. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Today Lamar and I are going on the <i>Chelsea Lately</i> show. &gt;&gt; CHELSEA: And you're not pregnant? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think so. &gt;&gt; KIM: KHLOE is pregnant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's pregnant?! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS:Is that why they got married?
