- &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Honestly, you take Swiss Kriss... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: ...three times a week. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So do you. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: And I've never ever seen you move your bowels. I've never seen it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, boys don't need to know that girls do that. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I do need to know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you don't. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It would connect us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're very close already. I see you do a lot of things. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Do you use the bathroom? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Of course. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: How many times a day? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know-- I don't document it and write it down. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: When do you go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Every day is different. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: As soon as I leave, do you go? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not holding it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Is that why you call-- you call me in the afternoon and like, "Where are you at?" To find out how much time you've got before you...? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't know how you're hiding this. I've been with you every... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not hiding it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Leave me alone about this conversation. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I need to know this about you. If not, then we can't make-- take the next step. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are being bad. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Then we can't take the next step, Khloe. You can hit me all you want. Yeah, I'm telling you. You're crazy. 28 00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:01,461 I'm putting cameras in the bathroom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm out here in the... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...the pavilion, darling. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come down here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you have to come back here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. You've got to listen to this, Kendall. Come on. Kris and I's 20th anniversary is coming up. And 20 years of marriage is really a big thing. So, I've been planning something for a long time that's really going to be special. I have an announcement to make. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here's the deal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls, we are coming up on our anniversary-- 20 years. Major, major, major. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It was a little black and red bug. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wait. Listen, girls. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Get it off of me! Get it off! Seriously, get it-- get it off. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls, girls... You're scaring the dog. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't want to touch it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kylie, Kylie, stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's nothing in your hair. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't want to take it out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can I finish? Girls, listen, okay? To make it a very special and memorable 20th anniversary, I decided to do something, girls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's gotten into you, honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're going to Bora Bora. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We what? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're going to Bora Bora, girls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The entire family is going. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hold on, hold on, this is too much for my brain to handle. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Gabbana, stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who's going? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everybody. All you're wearing is a bathing suit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I need to wrap my brain around this. Somebody's got to pay attention to me for one second. First of all, I cannot be on a plane for 14 hours. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's only eight hours. Nonstop right to Papeete, Tahiti. We're flying on Air Tahiti... &gt;&gt; KRIS: To where? Okay, but we could stay right here, and... See that little bed over there with the orange pillow? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I just spent the last... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why don't you want to go? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...two months planning this thing. Wow. I'm-- I'm shocked. She's, like, not excited about all of this. Please accept it, we're going. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's actually sweet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A little credit? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where credit is due. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Why is it that gives you the cringes? It's so repulsive. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. We're going to do it again just to piss you off. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ew. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ew. You guys are disgusting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Should I bring my sunglasses in? So Lauren is, like, one of my best friends in the whole wide world. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I can't be myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Because I'm a hand grenade. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm in New York with Kris and I'm just really excited to introduce him to one of my best friends Lauren. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Hey, there you are. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Oh, my God, he's tall as &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris lives so far away, and he's been working playing basketball, so I'm excited to have him meet everyone. He's, like, slowly starting to meet all my friends. And I've invited Kris to Bora Bora. So, I'm kind of, like, anxious for everyone to get to know Kris, 'cause I know, like, once they do, they'll understand why I love him so much. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: So you're the guy who's making her happy now, huh? I love that. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm trying to. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: It's about time that somebody's treating her the way she deserves. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I feel like I'm meeting your second parents here. Should I like...? Let me take this chance to, uh... &gt;&gt; LAUREN: You have to ask. : Congratulations. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, wait, will you take that off for a sec? &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: They can pretend. &gt;&gt; J.R.: Is that the size you need-- accept? &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Anything, anything over ten... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Other hand. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Let me see. It looks good. You look good like a married woman, lady. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're bitching, aren't you? &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Let's just go to Miami now-- tonight. &gt;&gt; J.R.: There you go. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Aw... &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Is Rob here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Did he bring anyone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, he... &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Okay, well, we have an extra one. We have two row one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob and I are at Lauren's, and we're hanging out on her phenomenal yacht. We just missed Kim and Kris, but, you know, we still have fun the three of us hanging out. I heard that Kim and her new man were here visiting you. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Yeah. Have you met him? &gt;&gt; ROB: He's cool. He called me last night with Kim, but he's never... I don't really know the dude. Like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's kind of a douche. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: No. He is the nicest, sweetest, sweetheart. Loves her, worships her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, when I first met him, he asked me, "Is your marriage real or for television?" &gt;&gt; LAUREN: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And then he asked me if Kim's ass is fake. Like, all these things. Like, in one... My first time meeting him. I have only met Kris at the most three times. You know, I'm not very impressed. So at this moment, I don't have a lot of great things to say about Kris. For all I know, Kris could treat Kim like a princess. But I haven't been around to see it. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: She's in love. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's in love with him. &gt;&gt; LAUREN: Yeah, I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In love with him. &gt;&gt; SHOP CLERK: Just a signature, please. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. There you go. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm at the mechanic with Kourtney, 'cause she dragged me here to come pick up her car that had a flat tire. Hi. What are you doing? Kourtney. Please stop. I'm going to put you on speaker. Hold on. What were you-- what were you saying? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I said, Kourtney, just because you have a kid and you don't do anything fun, does not make you mature. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely don't know what I think of Kris yet. None of us have really spent any serious amount of time with him. He's very sarcastic. And I just don't know what to make of him yet. You literally remind me of my brother Rob, 'cause you're so immature. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're twins. They're twins. &gt;&gt; KIM: Guys. Open. I have lunch. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yum, let's go eat. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, will you turn the air off? It's, like, so freezing, I can't function. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll turn it off. Because it's your world, Kim, and I just live in it. &gt;&gt; KIM: The whole world isn't going through menopause, just you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're funny. So what's going on, doll? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just so excited about our trip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not as excited as you are. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just scared to go be in a bathing suit in front of all you people. I think we all come to an age where our body image is a little frightening. I don't like a lot of things about my body. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should have been working out for years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I didn't, so shoot me, okay? There's nothing worse than everybody else having fun in their bikini, and me being wrapped in a towel. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, we have a fun trip planned. Kris is coming. Why don't you just want to go and enjoy yourself? I'm so excited that Kris is coming on the trip with us. We really haven't spent a whole lot of time all at once together. So, this is a huge test of our relationship. And I'm, like, "Mom, don't ruin it for everyone just because you have weird feelings about being in a bikini." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you know I've only really spent maybe half an hour with Kris? &gt;&gt; KIM: That's why we've got to go on vacation because I want you to get to know him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that the only way that I'm gonna get to spend some time with that guy? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What if you hate him? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Then we've got a problem. &gt;&gt; KIM: We don't have a problem. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll have a problem. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love him. That's all that matters. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you excited? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's literally heaven on Earth. Do you like this guy? Look. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He has bigger boobs than I do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, his boobs are so big. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, it smells like my grandma. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is like a junkyard. God, I am terrified of, like, an animal's gonna come out of here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, there's a bee, Bible. It's right on me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's a bee on you? What? Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. Do you think these things are gonna be like what Tahiti looks like? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. I don't think I'm going. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. What do you mean? You want me to hang out with Kim and Kris alone? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I want you to go to Tahiti with your family. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, you have to come. It's not funny. It's our entire family's going on a trip. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But what do you want me to do, go alone without Lamar? Like, everyone's gonna be coupled up, and I'm gonna be alone while Lamar's in L.A.? I don't think so. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You can't handle that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like being with my husband, sorry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not saying you don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Maybe this is time for you and Scott to get to know Kris and Kim better. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Knowing that Khloe's not even going makes me really nervous. I just don't know Kris Humphries, and I could just see him and I getting into it. We're gonna be thrown into getting to know him on an island. What if we're stranded, and Kris and I don't get along? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. I think that the older I get, the more matronly I look, and it's just snowballing in my head as something that I really need to take care of. Hello. To see Dr. Fisher. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: He'll be right with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, thank you. So, I came in to see my dear friend and plastic surgeon Garth Fisher to see if I can have a little somethin'-somethin' done before the vacay. Are you a patient? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? Are you having something done? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Well, I had it done already. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. What'd you do? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: On my breasts. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm thinking about having a reduction, so I'm just a little bit nervous. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Why do you want a reduction? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because they kind of get in the way, you know? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: That's what I used to think. When I got them redone, it just, like, lifts your whole body up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It would take a crane to lift my whole body up. We would still be cranking away hours after the surgery. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Hi. They're ready for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Okay. I'm in the mood for a boob show. Hey. &gt;&gt; GARTH: Hey, Kris, how are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; GARTH: Good to see you again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good to see you. I'm, um, nervous. &gt;&gt; GARTH: You're nervous? Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I want to talk to you because, well, I want to do two things: I want to have my boobs done. I want to take 'em out and make 'em smaller, and then still have 'em still kinda perky. I mean, I'm not dead yet. And then I wanted to do my neck. &gt;&gt; GARTH: All right, first of all, here's the problems that you have: Number one is, you have these muscle bands. These muscle bands start separating and dropping. And that's, that's what's going on down there. It would be really helpful if you get rid of this crease. It makes your chin look kind of like a double. Okay, there's some options to tighten 'em up a little bit. You can choose door number one where we make an incision around the nipple areola, take out some skin, maybe make your implant smaller. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would really like to give my whole body a lift. &gt;&gt; GARTH: The other thing that you might have to do is you might have to take out one millimeter under your skin. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's the recovery time for that? &gt;&gt; GARTH: Two months to heal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not really that realistic for me to think that I can recover before we leave for Bora Bora. So, now I have to go on this feeling horrible about my body. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're in Bora Bora! Whoo! This trip is the first time Kris is hanging out with my whole family. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You guys are like parents who have been together for 30 years. Show some PDA. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kris says whatever comes to his mind. He has no filter. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's way too hot. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: They're all gonna be hot if the door's open, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's giving me anxiety. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This is a side of Kim I've never seen before. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna have 283 00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,752 a panic attack. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You're crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello, hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Bruce, where's my carry-on? We are at LAX Airport getting ready to to go Bora Bora, and I'm so excited. Can't you tell? &gt;&gt; KIM: This trip will be, like, the first real time Kris is hanging out with my whole family. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I love it, babe. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris is a really, like, loving and open person, so I think that as soon as everyone just gets to meet Kris, they'll just love him the way I do. I mean, what's there not to love? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES : I'm excited because I've spent a lot of time with Kim, but not a ton of days in a row. You know, you really can't hide anything when you're on vacation with someone. And you really get to know that next level of them. And I look forward to it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mason, I told you to go to sleep! That's good. Now get up, please. Oh, what sound does a sheep make? &gt;&gt; ROB: Wait. How does he do that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What about a dog? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get ready for a fabulous vacay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Listen, you'd better get ready for a fabulous vacay and get ready to get in that bikini. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wouldn't be caught dead in a bikini the way that I feel. I will be covered up from here to here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mas, no! No, no, no! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's move and shake. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Moving along. &gt;&gt; ROB: Next stop, Boring Boring. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Boring Bora Bora. &gt;&gt; KIM: Sorry, sorry. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Welcome to Air Tahiti Nui. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is beautiful. I feel like we're already on vacation. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do we have little toothbrush? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Kim, here's an eye mask; it's perfect. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The goodies just keep coming. What do we got? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Pajamas. Yes, please. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Jammies. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. Do you think I would be a large? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna wear these pajamas on the beach. &gt;&gt; KIM: Peek-a-boo! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right, enough with him. Come here, baby. Give me some attention. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you so jealous of him? We need to pull it back. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: How's my hair? &gt;&gt; KIM: But can you pull it, like, farther back with your long arm? Yeah. You look skinnier that way. You're welcome. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: This is our first vacation as a couple. I'm so excited for us. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: My baby's looking so pretty today. Arf, arf! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let the party start. Here's to... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 20 years, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay! Cheers, honey. 340 00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,942 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 20 years, here we go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Wow, this is beautiful. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We made it to Bora Bora, baby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Amazing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Can we just call you Mama Kris, then? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mama Kris, or KJ. I think Mama Kris is better. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because every time somebody yells "Kris," I'm going to go "Huh? What?" &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Welcome to Bora Bora. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, you want one? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Welcome to Bora Bora. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get picked up at the airport by a boat. Taken to your room. Not bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have never seen more turquoise, crystal-clear water. It's so, like, surreal-looking. It's honestly like the prettiest place I've ever seen. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, I really want to jump in the water. It is so nice. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I think it's pretty shallow, though. I wouldn't dive. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'd give you a hundred bucks to jump overboard. &gt;&gt; ROB: A hundred? Put your money where your mouth is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll put it in your mouth, just like that waiter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's nice, Scott. Your first vacation! Whoo-hoo! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your first vacay. : Oh, my. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Get out of here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, let me try that. Ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. Here, I'll help you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ready? Okay, Kris, ready, get her up there! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, I did it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so romantic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My neck. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott, Kris has a really important question. For you and Kourtney. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You guys are like parents who have been together for 30 years, bro. Show some PDA. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We'll see you guys in five years. And then you tell me how much you guys want to touch each other. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kris just says literally whatever comes to his mind. He has no filter. Telling Scott and I we should really be more affectionate, especially in front of Mason. Mind your own business. Like, we are happy and we're doing our thing. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You know what this trip is for? This is for, like, rekindling the fire. &gt;&gt; ROB: He's got a point there. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: By the time we leave, it's gonna be back on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm excited. That's our room there, on the end, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think so. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you, baby. At first, I was so hesitant in coming, but now I feel so happy that my entire family's here on this vacation. We're all together, and it feels really good to see a smile on everyone's face. &gt;&gt; ROB: Look at this guy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, this is amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my gosh, he's so excited. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I could so get that job. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I used to do before I got in bed with Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Fantasy Island. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bob, give her a show. &gt;&gt; ROB: Is that girl here for me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just happens to be one random chick? &gt;&gt; ROB: I know, I... That's what I said. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's beautiful women on the beach in bikinis already. I am not taking my... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm going to stick with the Lakers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...sarong off to save my life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, dude, those girls are 20 years old. Well, I think your body looks fine, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you, Scott. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bring Bora Bora! Whoo! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Look at all the flowers all over the bed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So this is where Obama stayed. 417 00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:53,065 &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Look at the view. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is gorgeous. But the fact that it's so hot in here, I want the other room. It's way too hot. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's 'cause it's open. What are you saying? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Come on. You're so rude. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't want this room. It's too hot. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: They're all going to be hot if the door's open, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's giving me anxiety to have this big room. And all these flowers, I'm such a neat freak; it's really giving me anxiety. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's called a Presidential Suite. This is a side of Kim I've never seen before. We got the best room at the whole resort. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just like small rooms. I've always been like that. I hate a big space. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: It's going to be the same room, just like, shutting the door. You're crazy. She's kind of freaking out over something that most people would die for. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think I'm going to have a panic attack. I gotta get out of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kris picks me up and throws me in the water, like I'm just a doll. Â - &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We just got to get that AC going. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's just jump in with all of our clothes on. Off here. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't know about up here; I don't know how deep it is. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll jump in right now. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Right now? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Baby, give me a hug real quick. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm going to push you in, babe. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Give me a hug before I get pushed in. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You saw that coming, though, huh? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hold on. I don't want to jump in... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I don't know how deep it is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Please take your shorts off. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Baby, I think I see a shark. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. Don't play with... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I see a shark. I know. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You jump off of there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is... Hey, stop! &gt;&gt; KIM: No! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know, jump in. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Baby... &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow, I'm going to have such a headache. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: My earring's gone! &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I'm going to cry. I don't have any earrings. I love Kris, but he's just so rough when he picks me up and throws me in the water like I'm just a doll. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Hold on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Please leave. Not funny. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, literally, that's $75,000. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Let me get goggles. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not going to flippin' run for this... &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We'll find it, baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're not going to find it in the ocean. This is seriously so &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: What, are you faking this right now? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm not faking. &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: We've literally been here an hour. She freaks out over the room, she freaks out over the earring. What are the next ten days gonna be like? I'm nervous. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: You were married? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You didn't know that? &gt;&gt; HUMPHRIES: I'm really shocked. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want to renew our vows. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't feel good about my body. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you guys been drinking? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We knocked back some brewskies. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's definitely had one beer, and I've set the boundaries; he knows what's acceptable and what's not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you got some attitude, kiddo.
