- â™« &gt;&gt; ROB: How am I gonna know if myare going away? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: We can do a test. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm just saying, like, is it ever gonna go away? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Aw... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Pregnancy pillow! &gt;&gt; ROB: Is that what... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I sleep... &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't it a good one? With the fabric? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you want to take a picture of us? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yes, that's good. Hold on. &gt;&gt; ROB: Stop. Stop! Stop! I'm gonnaon your face. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay, so stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You always take it to the next level, Rob. Don't... &gt;&gt; ROB: So... Lamar actually gave me this idea of starting... we're start... &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob... &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I'm serious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; ROB: He's going to back it. Starting a porn company. I know so many porn stars... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know you do. &gt;&gt; ROB: I know some of... I know the top director. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What, Seymour Butts? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Do you know how much money is made in porn? Especially if I market it the right way and really just kill it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So are you gonna get your gold teeth put in, and be a... like, do porn, and...? Rob definitely tells stories for a reaction. These things never really happen, so I just listen, and I get entertained. &gt;&gt; ROB: I go on youcom every morning, probably five... &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, that is so disgusting. &gt;&gt; ROB: I wake up... I wake up at 6:00 a.m. just to jerk off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: I had dinner last night with all my girlfriends, and they're just like, "Well, I mean, like, the first few months, like, you'll never have sex. Like, you won't even care." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sex? I was the horniest I've ever been after I gave birth. Like, I couldn't, like... I... &gt;&gt; KIM: That's what Larsa said. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Birthing experience, for me, was so delicious... &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and so amazing that I wanted to do it over and over and tell everybody. "And then, the placenta came out. And then..." &gt;&gt; KIM: Ew. 47 00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,853 Mom, this is disgusting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was amazing. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's all about a good mirror. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think anyone over the age of 30 should look into one of these. &gt;&gt; KIM: I look fab in one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, wait a second. I need this. I need a... a really good paddle brush. Do they have them in silver? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, yeah, they do. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't reach. Will you get those small butterfly clips? I need those. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, this is, like, my dream come true. Two of these... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KIM: They're telling me now that my house won't be ready until February. And I have to be out of my house in July. That is so annoying. I have to get a new place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did you add to your house that's gonna take so much longer? &gt;&gt; KIM:They can't get the permits in time. They can't push it back months, like... months. I am already so hormonal, I have so much on my plate... 69 00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,753 I, like, cannot take this news. It's just so frustrating. &gt;&gt; BRODY: So, Malibu. This is where you used to live, huh? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's the old stomping grounds. &gt;&gt; BRODY: A lot's changed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, boy, you have no idea. PCH is a little more congested. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Wait a minute. Are we coming up on the sand hill, here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What sand hill? &gt;&gt; BRODY: What do you mean, "What sand hill?" The sand hill that you told us as little kids that you would give us $100 if we could ever beat you up? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! &gt;&gt; BRODY: You remember that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That sand hill! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Well, it's coming up here, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No way. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I think we need to make a stop. For old times' sake. Let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: About 15, maybe 16 years ago, I said, "I'll tell you what. I'll give you 100 bucks if you can beat me to the top of this hill," and they're going, "Yeah, Dad, that sounds like fun. Okay, we're going." I killed 'em. Now he wants his revenge. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You got your hundred? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, no. I made that bet 20 years ago. &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, come on, we gotta... we gotta do this. All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's just go... see, to that rock right there? &gt;&gt; BRODY: No, we're going all the way. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go! My ankle... Oh, my poor knee. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I thought you guys were going to the top! &gt;&gt; BRODY: We're going. It's the resting stage. Whew! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now get your butts back down here. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Probably one of the highlights of my life, to beat him up the sand hill. And obviously, it's a lot easier now than 1976. But at least we did it. He never let us win when he had an advantage, so... I didn't think we'd-we'd let him win. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A little slower than 20 years ago, but the good news is... we're all still here. 109 00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,055 &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yep. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: To fight another hill. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just none of these houses here are in a gated community. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's the issue of why I was selling my house in the first place. And there's so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Remember, we told you that when you bought your house? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but I still love my house. Like, it was perfect up until now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe Mom heard of something going up for rent around here. Let's call Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you know of any good houses for lease? 'Cause we're look... trying to think for Kim. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, there's a house for lease up the street. But why doesn't she just move into our house? Why would she want to spend all this money? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why would she want to live with you when she has a brand-new baby? Like, they need to do their own thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. It's like... it-it might be a little much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can certainly help you when the baby comes home from the hospital. &gt;&gt; KIM: Drive... oh! Do not... Honk at these people, and drive. Do not let them go in front of us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's going on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just a bunch of... &gt;&gt; KIM: There's just, like, 15 cars of paparazzi, so it makes it really difficult. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You should be here, Kim, behind my gates, because paparazzi can't get in here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's not a calm environment at your house. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know it's obviously easier to just move in with my mom, but I want some place that I can just relax and enjoy the baby, and learn so much along the way, and I don't know if my mom's house really is the best place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well... &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I will think about it. Thank you for the offer, but I'm gonna look. &gt;&gt; KRIS: At least I'm practic... I'm just trying to be practical. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Practical Pat, that's your new name. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She should move in here, that's the right thing to do. 152 00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,390 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Love you, toots. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go, a little Ping-Pong! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: So we can practice the two serves each thing. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Whoa... I think you got it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Damn! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Now you gotta hit the table... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I was so set up for it. Bruce, come on, you're being too timid. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRODY: The Jenners, in general, are all very competitive. Definitely stems from Bruce. I guess he gave it to us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brandon knows all about this. What'd you get, third in the tournament? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, I did. I want to go back and do better, but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, Brandon has been playing in this tournament, down at the Malibu Inn. And, uh, I think what we have to do now is we both have to enter, to prove once and for all who's the best. I should enter. enter. That makes sense, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I should enter. 'Cause I could pull off first. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, you think... Oh, listen to you! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, we gotta have at least one Jenner in there. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think it's nice to finally see Bruce bond with his sons. You know, he's had, like, this rough relationship with them for 179 00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,893 so long that it's really good just to see him happy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Ooh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ooh. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Wow. 183 00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,135 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This gets pretty violent here, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Put your teeth... like, go like this. Look up to the ceiling. Play with it... I know, but it like... you feel the muscle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am so into this. Oh, I was gonna write you today. Would your people let you rent your house back from them? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm renting it now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can they let... extend it? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And you'd want to rent a house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't want to be all the way on the other side of town, and you need one of us... You're gonna be isolated in Beverly Hills with a baby. Live with me in this gorgeous house. That would be, like, the perfect scenario. The one thing Kim doesn't need is stress, so living here gives her absolute freedom and no time limit. So if anything gets delayed again, she doesn't have to worry about moving out. &gt;&gt; KIM: I hate black and white. Like, I can't take a shower in a black shower. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is not chic about my black shower? I mean, I feel like a ninja in this shower. Yah! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, and the toilet paper's black... Like, I like to see what I'm and what I'm wiping. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can actually buy some white toilet paper. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. The toilet paper also leaves little black dots in your vag. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can actually buy some white toilet paper. I know that's shocking. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just know I'm gonna get crazy and I'll, like, go crazy living here. I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are so picky about every single thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just saying. When I stayed at my mom's after I filed for divorce, it was just me, so it was, like, the best sanctuary. And this time, moving into my mom's, there's just a lot more people and I don't know if this is the right environment for us to learn how to raise a newborn with so much chaos going on. Could I really live here? She literally is crazy. She's so psychotic. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just out to, like, an early dinner with Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, you're not gonna be eating here? &gt;&gt; KIM: He's just trying to be helpful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He also has other responsibility, just not here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't help at home? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just, you're being such a nag-- like, relax. 229 00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,233 &gt;&gt; KRIS: What an ass, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stay out of it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So what's popping? What are you making me for lunch? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY:I hate when things are so cold on my hands. Ooh... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is that thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Armenian dessert. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It looks like a dildo. Looks like it's ribbed for your pleasure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know, I bought these chicken wings for you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Someone probably gave those to you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at all this crab. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God! You got a cold call. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cleaning out my freezer, and I have, like, pounds of frozen crab. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's got crabs! &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, I am so annoyed. I got this stroller. I'm trying to, like, put it together. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The good news is once the baby comes, that's when it gets so much easier. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you want, I'll come over there and help you. It's not that hard-- you just need... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Could you put ours together? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, but I've learned the ways of the roads of the children's life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now that they're put together. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I will come over and show you how to open a stroller. I'm good with these things now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Anything I can get. Okay, I have to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's definitely odd that Scott won't lift a finger around the house, but he's, like, jumping up to help Kim with anything that she needs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just trying to help. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't want to help me... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't help you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at the kids, how beautiful they are because of this spermicide that I gave... injected into your vagina. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you just relax. Stop. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you... what do you need from me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want some help? Come here, baby girl. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, just who I'm looking for. I need a Ping-Pong partner. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're going... We're leaving. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're leaving? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, I need somebody to play with. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Aw. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, come on. Five minutes, that's all I need. The tournament is getting closer. I know Brandon is really practicing. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're gonna lose. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think I'm gonna lose. I think it's time to get real serious about this. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We're gonna leave. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. Love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A couple of bangs back and forth-- that's all I get? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There's more to life than Ping-Pong. Okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: In Ping-Pong, not like golf-- golf you can practice by yourself. Ping-Pong you have to have a partner. Cruz! &gt;&gt; CRUZ: Yes? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You play Ping-Pong? &gt;&gt; CRUZ: I... no. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, come on down. Come on, come on. And the problem I have is that nobody in my side of the family-- you know, Kendall, Kylie, Kris, everybody-- they can't play it. Okay, here we go. &gt;&gt; CRUZ: Oop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oop, nah! This may not work out very well. Oh, close. All right. All right, keep working at it. &gt;&gt; CRUZ: Oop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oop, that's a good start. Oop. &gt;&gt; CRUZ: Oop. Me never play Ping-Pong. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, hello? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What exactly are you even wearing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Relax, they're, like, bike shorts. They're a nude-color bike shorts; I'm sorry it makes you feel so uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I get it, I just feel, like, your voluptuous pregnant body shouldn't be in bike shorts maybe around people. Kind of feel... You know what I mean? There's just, like a lot going on... &gt;&gt; KIM: If anything, it's, like, less attractive than, like, my skinny, toned, amazing... Can we just reminisce for one second? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're gonna get back there-- a lot of times, you become thinner after you have your first. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so... I don't think I am. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your boobs are getting a little big to... &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's a lot going on here for me to look at. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's very uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, you're gonna have to stomach my Spanx for, like, one sec. Okay, I'll throw these sweats on. They're Calvin Klein, but look at them-- they're supposed to fold over... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You look like the Nutty Professor. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. Let's look at the strollers. Like, why can't this just come with the baby already in it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You can, but that's, like, some Brad Pitt See? It's not a big deal. I mean, you just got to get all the plastic off. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, how fancy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh, it's coming together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where does this go? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Aren't there, like, papers? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No one ever said this whole baby thing was easy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, right there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where'd you get it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Right there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh... &gt;&gt; KIM: Will you snap a photo of this? I want to send it to Kanye. I've got to see what skin tone my child is before I can... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your kid's gonna be black. &gt;&gt; KIM: I... It's... It'll be a variation of a skin tone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, I'm just trying to see what color... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You good? This good? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SOO YEON: You can turn to your left side a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Okay. &gt;&gt; SOO YEON: Right to left. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: My mom has a friend. Her name is Soo Yeon Lee and she's a professional Ping-Pong player. So I've hired Soo Yeon. And I think that my strategy for improvement is definitely better than my dad's. Oh, that... that up-spin, God. &gt;&gt; SOO YEON: It comes very slow when... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, slower, yeah. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Brandon, Brandon. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: What? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Brandon, Bruce. Bruce is here. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: My dad? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Don't let him down. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Okay, I'll try. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I don't want my dad to know that we're practicing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Bruiser! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How are you doing, babe? &gt;&gt; LEAH: You look good in gray. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SOO YEON: You practice. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, I'll practice. I promise. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; SOO YEON: You're welcome. So maybe I'll come by on Wednesday. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yes, that would be amazing. &gt;&gt; SOO YEON: Your dad's gonna be so mad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I see a lot of Ping-Pong balls-- evidence-- on the floor. My son Brandon is exactly like me. I think Brandon is taking this very seriously and practicing a lot. I have evidence. To be honest with you, it makes it fun. I always used to say back in the old days when I was competing that I love my competitor because he brings the best out in me. And I think there's... the level of Ping-Pong is gonna go up a level just because we're both taking this thing seriously. Oh, look at this. 375 00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:08,634 My God. That little bugger. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so excited for this meal. Can I get a Cleopatra salad? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Okay. And is that gonna be a full size or a half salad? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll do a full size. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll do half. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Half size? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're making me look like a pig. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're pregnant. This is your time to live it up. Do you ever, like, talk about what you guys are gonna do with the baby? Like... &gt;&gt; KIM: He's never even held a baby before. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He doesn't need to. I mean, it's-it's different. If another kid threw up on me, I'd be weirded out. My own kids, like, you know, it's not... &gt;&gt; KIM: Most kids I don't like, I've got to be honest. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, me neither. And look at Mase. I couldn't ask for anything better than him. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. I think Kanye will be so obsessed and so into it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. So, have you signed up for any classes? &gt;&gt; KIM: I really want to do this, like, CPR class, just in case. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We did a CPR class. Kourtney, like, loved the girl who did our CPR class. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, like, loved her. Hold on, I'll call her and see if we can get her number. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really want to do that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll go with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: You will? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just out to, like, an early dinner with Kim. Just going over, like, some baby stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, well, I was just about to make dinner. So, you're not gonna be eating here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't think we had dinner plans. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, we didn't have, like, official plans. I wish you would've told me so I knew. I was just about to... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I thought... Oh. Well, anyway, do you still have the girl's number...? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your phone's breaking up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's that now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She is not pleased. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? 'Cause we're having dinner? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Everybody knows that Kourtney likes to keep pretty close tabs on me, and I can't really blame her. I mean, I don't have the best track record in the world, but I'm just trying to be helpful and I'm being there for somebody in her family. But the funny thing is, if I didn't help her sister, I'd be in trouble for that. That is not gonna be fun to go home to. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not at all. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This sucker fires 'em out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A ball machine? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I gotta keep up on Brandon. I can't let him win. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't understand why you just weren't honest with me and told me where you were going. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It wasn't that I was being dishonest, I just didn't say where I was going. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You wouldn't mention a class? That's a little shady. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't really win with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; JASON: Jason. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Scott. How are you? &gt;&gt; JASON: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've actually been to one of these before. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you remember CPR, though? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh... Find it pretty ridiculous that I need to, like, sneak around to help Kim. But I already told Kim that I would go to a CPR class with her before Kourtney got upset about me going to dinner with her. So I figured, if we're gonna go to a CPR class, I'll find one, and we'll try to have some fun and make it easy and get through it. &gt;&gt; JASON: All right, let's say you come into a room and there's just somebody lying there, and you have no idea what's going on. What do you think we should do? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Have sex with her. &gt;&gt; JASON: Well, not right away. At least take her out to dinner. Things like that. But she's just laying there, so what do you think? What should we do? &gt;&gt; KIM: I would think they're sleeping. &gt;&gt; JASON: No. Good, good, good. Now, if they're breathing, what does that mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: They're alive. &gt;&gt; JASON: They're alive. Do we need to do anything? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JASON: Like what? &gt;&gt; KIM: You console them. &gt;&gt; JASON: Console them? We're gonna hug them. No one's ever said "console them." That's a sweet thing to say. But generally speaking, if someone's not breathing, you always do CPR. You guys are gonna stand up. Heel of your hand is gonna go right here. The other hand's gonna be on top of that. So, you're gonna do 30 compressions, one after the other. And one and two and three and four. Louder! Come on! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Five, six, seven, nine, ten... &gt;&gt; KIM: Eight, nine, ten, 11... &gt;&gt; JASON: 11, 12. Don't confuse each other. &gt;&gt; ALL: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. &gt;&gt; JASON: What do you think we're gonna do now? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna sit. &gt;&gt; JASON: Pass out, we're gonna sit down. We're gonna relax. This is tough work. Which brings me to the next thing, which is choking. Here. Come on over here so we can demonstrate to her. I'm gonna get my leg in between your legs. That's my wallet. Don't worry, Scott. So I've got my fist right below his rib cage. I'm gonna go inward and upward as hard as I can. You ready, Scott? You ready? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I guess. &gt;&gt; JASON: Inward and upward. Inward and upward. Inward and upward. Now don't hold back on him. He can handle it. He wants it all. So just go wham! Don't even hold back. Now we're gonna do a scary part, which is baby CPR-- if the baby stops breathing. Hold the baby in your arm. Counting out loud, and... &gt;&gt; ALL: One, two, three, four, five. &gt;&gt; JASON: Breath. Faster. &gt;&gt; ALL: One, two, three, four, five. &gt;&gt; JASON: Go! &gt;&gt; ALL: â™« One, two, three, four, five, kick! One, two, three, four, five. â™« &gt;&gt; JASON: Come on, Kim, go with it. &gt;&gt; ALL: â™« One, two, three, four, five, kick! â™« One, two, three, four, ooh-ooh! â™« &gt;&gt; JASON: Okay, that was just for fun. But the whole idea is that you will never forget something as ridiculous as the conga line. You guys are trained in CPR. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you for that fun CPR training. &gt;&gt; JASON: You're very welcome. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, you, too. &gt;&gt; JASON: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nice to meet you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, let's go, 'cause I gotta get home before Kourtney kills me for doing all these things with you and nothing with her. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? Does she know that we're here at the CPR class? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. Well, she'll know that it's not... I wasn't doing anything bad. I mean, it was something good. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's so weird, though. Kourtney can be so crazy with Scott, but then he lied about where he was-- with me-- which just, like, makes it look so shady. We're at a CPR class. There's no reason to lie. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just trying to, like, make sure you get everything done before the baby comes. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I get it that she's crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have a box downstairs by the front door. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I ordered a ball machine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A ball machine? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I gotta keep up on Brandon. I can't let him win. Here we go! Look out! Now we got a little rhythm going. Now we got a little rhythm going. There's really nobody in my family that can compete with the kid here. And this ball machine; the most expensive, nicest ball machine I've ever seen in my life. I think it's really gonna give me the edge against the "Great One," Brandon. It's a workout! Who would have thunk it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Where have you been? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was doing something with Kim. Am I late? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Almost. Um, what were you guys doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, she had to do a CPR class, so I went with her, 'cause I've done one with you, so I figured I'd go, like, keep her company. You seem like you're being super cold. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't understand why you just weren't honest with me and told me where you were going. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It wasn't that I was being dishonest. I just didn't say where I was going. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You wouldn't mention a class? That's a little shady. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's calm down. It's not a little shady. We went to a CPR class. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm happy that you're helping her... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I don't think you are. 'Cause if you were, you'd say, "Oh, wow. That's great." I'm only doing what I know from you. And that's being there for everybody in times of need. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. It's definitely annoying that Scott is willing to go above and beyond for Kim when he never did for me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doll, you coming? &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like you can't beat my... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No problem. No one needs to help me. Oh, don't worry about it. You just sit down, and I'll get the door. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to help me start doing this crib? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You think the baby's gonna know if I built this or not? Only reason I didn't say anything is because the other time that I was with Kim doing something, you got mad that I was, like, out to dinner with her then after. I can't really win with you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Anything in the ocean I'm cool with, 'cause I love the ocean, so... &gt;&gt; BRODY: How many times I keep telling you? Come surfing. Hit me up. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, and he doesn't show up. Kind of like you and golf with me. I keep calling up, "Golf today." &gt;&gt; BRODY: I'm just afraid to play with you, okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, is that it? &gt;&gt; BRODY: He's-he's so competitive. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob's the one we got to get competitive. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm competitive. I'm just competitive at different things. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Like what? Typing? You just need to get your old competitive juices. You're hanging... What'd you...? You grew up with a bunch of chicks. Look-it, I've been competing all my life, and the tournament's getting closer. I know Brandon is really practicing, kind of taking it up a notch. I think it's time to get real serious about this. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh! Whoa, look at that. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yo, look at... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This thing's pretty wild. It's like an air conditioning unit. &gt;&gt; BRODY: This thing is unbelievable. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ready? &gt;&gt; ROB: What? Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't knock my balls out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the hell?! It's coming hot! &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not doing this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob, you stand back a little, man. &gt;&gt; ROB: This thing's fun. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Give it to me. Give it to me. Let 'em go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: These things are coming like wildfire! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Bring it on! That's how good Bruce is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wait till I make it tough on you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is out of control. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look out 'cause I'm coming in that direction. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Coming in hot! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Coming in hot. This sucker fires 'em out. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh. Oh! There we go. Get the groove. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get it while it's hot! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Get it. Get it. Bruiser getting ready. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's been practicing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, he has been really practicing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Bruce and Brandon both are lying to each other. Bruce is saying that he is not practicing with his $2,500 machine, and Brandon's getting lessons from some professional. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here's Bruce, who's getting ready for the Olympics at table tennis. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Here we go. I always root for my brother, but when I saw my dad hit on that thing, it looked like he had a chance. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 60 bucks for this paddle. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let me see it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This little carrying case. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is some... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 'Cause Brandon's got a carrying case for his. I am practicing, practicing, practicing. The game is getting better and better and better. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Bruiser getting ready. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't think there's any way he can beat me. Come on! Come on! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Come on! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, I'm looking at Ping-Pong at the Olympics. Maybe. &gt;&gt; BRODY: That thing is intense. &gt;&gt; ROB: I still would rather play against human beings. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I bought a machine like that once, but it 629 00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,633 me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is the tennis court connected? &gt;&gt; REALTOR: Yeah. It's on the other side, by the Jacuzzi. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is so pretty and peaceful. Kanye is in Paris recording his album, so I want my mom to come with me to look at these houses that could be potential places that we rent before our house is ready. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: So there's five bedroom suites in the main house. Three guest houses, one of which 640 00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:14,266 is being used as a gym. &gt;&gt; KRIS: HermÃ¨s orange. &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's go. I'm getting tired of walking. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: Laundry room up here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It just feels so big. You know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Might be a little too much for you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have looked at so many different houses to rent, and nothing is just panning out. Nothing feels right. I want you and Kanye to go look at both houses. The style of it and the decorating, Kanye loves. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't like that they're so close together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Same here. Look at that driveway. Like, how annoying to get in and out and then turn into your garage. There's a lot of things weird. How horrendous is this color? I have so much on my plate, trying to find a safe place to live is, like, stressing me out. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: This whole Westlake Village area is all about families and children. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall and Kylie had no one to play with, so let's not get carried away. &gt;&gt; REALTOR: You lived out here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. I know, well... &gt;&gt; REALTOR: It's really... it's not that far. It's, like, 45 minutes from Beverly Hills. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, Kim, all I can tell you is I lived here for a couple of years, and no one ever came to see me. &gt;&gt; KIM: As gorgeous as the home could be, it's too far, too secluded, not enough gates. So I'm just... at this point, I'm so overwhelmed, I'm running out of time, I'm exhausted. I just really don't know what I'm gonna do right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know why you just don't move in with me. 671 00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:40,719 It's so much easier. Just saying. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Did you know that she's coaching him? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well done. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This was a setup! He's got a coach! &gt;&gt; LEAH: He's got a coach, Bruce. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's just trying to be helpful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He also has other responsibilities. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't get mad at me. Get mad at Kim for being pregnant. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you so angry and aggressive? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, just stay out of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've been losing a lot of sleep lately, trying to figure out this whole Kim living situation, and I think that the best solution is to have Kim move in with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. Because you are so indecisive right now... and you know that old saying, "Never make an important decision when you're pregnant." &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think you should just at least give me a month at my house so you can settle in with the baby and just let it kind of marinate for a minute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we'll give it a shot for a month while we look for something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's my girl. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just a compromise, while I look. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know this isn't the ideal choice that Kim wanted to make, but at the end of the day, I know it's the best place for her and my grandchild. I have a roommate! &gt;&gt; KIM: You have four. &gt;&gt; KRIS:Yeah, but who's counting? I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Hey! You look great, you look great. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is from 1976. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Is it really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Have you been here practicing all day? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No, I haven't been practicing. We just got here and set up the tables. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: From the day. I thought it might be intimidating you. It's competition time at the Malibu Inn Ping-Pong tournament. As I scan the room, I see... ...unfortunately, a lot of good Ping-Pong players. But this room has the smell of competition and beer. It's gonna be a good night. &gt;&gt; LEAH: She's amazing, isn't she? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just ridiculously good. &gt;&gt; LEAH: Did you know that she's coaching him? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Oh, you didn't know that? Did I just blow it? coaching him? &gt;&gt; LEAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No way! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Meet my coach, Soo Yeon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, really?! You didn't tell me! This was a setup! He's got a coach! I can't believe the dog went out there and got, like, a professional Ping-Pong tournament player-- this girl was, like, on the world team for Korea-- to get him prepared to come here and beat the old man. It's not fair. Found out she's been coaching Brandon. Brandon is just like me, isn't he? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, he's... of course. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's worse than me. &gt;&gt; BRODY: He's worse. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: First up, Bruce against Jonathon, and Brandon against Justin. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Bruce wins his first round! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: In Ping-Pong, you gotta kind of, like, get in the 736 00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,547 zone. Uh, I'm in the zone right now. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Nah,that. Come on, Brandon, do it right. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, I don't have a coach. Do you have a coach? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I don't have a coach. You have a coach, Brandon? &gt;&gt; BRODY: When we were little kids, my father enjoyed beating us-- at every sport. So it would be nice, you know, kind of like a little sweet revenge thing to have Brandon beat him. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Brandon won. Final round! 747 00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:23,041 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, buddy. Let's see what you got. &gt;&gt; PLAYER: Come on, sporty guy! Bring it on! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would love Brandon and me to go head to head, but I just cannot lose the next match. I mean, the pressure! &gt;&gt; KIM: Everything in this room. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, look at all this stuff. It's like my life's not complicated enough. Now I gotta help Kim move all stuff into my house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So are you gonna make Mom drive her crazy? 757 00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,975 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe that's a good idea. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Final round! &gt;&gt; PLAYER: Come on, sporty guy! Bring it on! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This guy across from me is, like, trash-talking playing Ping-Pong. I've never seen that before. But to play Brandon, I gotta beat this guy. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Game point! &gt;&gt; PLAYER: I won! Come on! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What has happened to the athletic ability? It's, like, gone out the window. But at least there's one Jenner left in the competition, so I might as well be, like, a cheerleader, and, uh, cheer old Brandon on. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: We're in the finals, everybody. We're in the finals! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I fought my way into the finals. This guy is probably the best guy I've ever played in my entire life. This is gonna be a really tough one, but at least it's the finals, right? &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: Game point! &gt;&gt; LEAH: He missed the table. &gt;&gt; MAN: Nice game! &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: And that's the competition. Great playing, everyone. Brandon Jenner came in second place. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nice job. Once you got past that one guy. Brandon winds up getting second in the tournament. I mean, against a guy that was really good-- looks like a professional. So, uh, my DNA lives on. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: In second place, Brandon Jenner! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I did it, Dad. I got you. I finally got you back after all these years. I'm really happy that, finally, 790 00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,511 it's me standing up here and not you. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I've got a whole room of baby stuff, and since I'm making the baby's room at Mom's house, I have a crib in the garage that I need help building. Not here, at Mom's. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where are you gonna stay? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna chill at Mom's for, like, a month, and then once she drives me crazy, I'm gonna move, you know... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's... that's a week. When is your house going to be done? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're closed. February. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just got a call saying not till February now. My moving day is coming up, to when I have to be out of my house. So I'm having Bruce and Khloe help me pack up some of the baby stuff and get it over to my mom's house, so that little by little, I'm just not overwhelmed and I have everything moved out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, look at all this stuff. This is all going to the car. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, you're number one. It's like my life's not complicated enough, now I got to help Kim move all her stuff into my house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How is this gonna go in your car? Wait. Don't drag it on her floor. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm not dragging it. It's one thing about girls, you know? They never really leave. They always wind up coming back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let me tell you, I have my reservations about all this. The last thing I need in the world is a hormonal woman and a little kid. I've been through all this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You already have... you have... Kris is hormonal enough. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris is very hormonal. I don't need another one. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom's gonna drive her crazy before the baby comes. She'll be out before the bib. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I hope so. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So are you gonna make Mom drive her crazy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Maybe that's a good idea. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where is this going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. What have I gotten myself into? &gt;&gt; KIM: I need help building that thingy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, the good old days. How many pounds do you think your baby's gonna be? &gt;&gt; KIM: He said my baby's a little small to average. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it's easier to push out that way. If you have a big huge baby, it's, like... ouch. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You gonna put wheels on there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott, how do you know how to do this? Who knew you had these talents? I've been popping these kids out, if you didn't notice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Color, Kim? Your paint swatches. Hey, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, how cute is this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't know, uh, you were here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'm trying to help out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love how you 846 00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:05,990 literally don't do any of this at our house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I've never done anything over there. I think we need to discuss what went on at your mom's. I don't want any tension to come between me and you or you and Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and I don't have tension. 853 00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,414 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're making things very awkward. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, I love how you literally don't do any of this at our house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I've never done anything over there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, don't be so jelly. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's unreal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, stay out of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's just trying to be helpful, because we're all in this room, and he was gonna put that crib together. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're all in this together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Obviously, we're all trying to be helpful, but he also has other responsibilities and doesn't let me know. Just comes here, doesn't tell me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't get mad at me. Get mad at Kim for being pregnant then. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I'm not mad at Kim for being pregnant. And I would appreciate you helping. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't want to help at home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Honestly, Kourtney, cut Scott some slack. He's just helping. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Which ones do you want? Or do you want two of each? Oh, there's three of each you told me to get. You just need two towels. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just took the tags off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They won't care. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She needs more than two towels. You're gonna get mad at me because I'm giving her opposite advice? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Youwash your towels every day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa! Who curses in the baby's room?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you so angry and aggressive? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're bringing a bad energy into this baby's room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause you don't know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had six kids! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You had a hundred nannies. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? I had no one when you were born, Kourtney. No one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You had a nurse. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No one. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She claims you didn't raise her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's the take-back pile? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That is mine! Give it to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the...? Oh! That's what I'm talking about! &gt;&gt; KIM: Guys... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, you're pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing?! Both of you guys! She's pregnant! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys are so annoying! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What if you hit the baby?! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, I'm going. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've brought a whole nother level to this situation that isn't necessary. Relax, Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, you can hang out with Scott all you want, 'cause I am over it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, we're not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, she is on a rampage. &gt;&gt; KIM: She is on a rampage. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honest to God, you know what's going on there? &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She has been the center of attention since the day Mason was born. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm over this, guys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you contemplating jumping? I've never seen you on the terrace in my life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was actually looking that I needed cushions for these chairs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is like torture. Oh. I thought you were over here thinking about jumping. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then I was looking at the yard and debating do I want to redo it? So many little questions that I would love your help with. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think we need to discuss what went on at your mom's. I don't want any tension to come between me and you or you and Kim or all of us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and I don't have tension. 921 00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,478 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're making things very awkward. Captioning sponsored by Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think we need to discuss what went on at your mom's. That was ridiculous. I mean, I think that you just want me all to yourself and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want you all to myself. I felt like the first time when I was pregnant, you were obsessed with me. And the second time you just, like, didn't want anything to do with me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was obsessed with you the second time. The only difference was I was taking care of a little boy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I just felt like you were different. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I definitely feel like I am a little guilty-- that I've been maybe a little bit more proactive with helping Kim. But the truth is that I've learned more and more throughout the two experiences I've had being pregnant with Kourtney. If we got pregnant again, I would know all this. The first time around, I was there for you more than I was the second time. But I want to try to be able to make it up to you now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. I'm actually really touched that Scott is helping Kim. Scott definitely is growing up, and now I feel guilty that I was even overreacting about this in the first place. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, whatever you need from me, I'm always here and I'm always on board. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And all I want to do is help you and make our life smoother than it already is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I like that, babe. I like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's why I was touching. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I'm talking about. KOURNEY: Alright &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, at least I talked you off this ledge. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS:Do you have a tummy ache or heartburn? &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I have really bad heartburn. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want some water? &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's in a glass, so you don't have any plastic touching those beautiful pregnant lips. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm actually glad that I made the decision to move into my mom's house. It is calm here. The bed's comfortable, our room is cool. Everything is, like, easy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are your feet? Are they swollen? Oh, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They look like baby balloons. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. And it doesn't hurt that she pampers a little bit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Put your little... sausage toes. It makes me feel so great that Kim has finally made this decision to move in with me. And now she'll be in a really, really safe place with just us to take care of her.
