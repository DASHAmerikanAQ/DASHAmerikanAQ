- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I gotta go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce doesn't even know that I was going to meet him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I want to go somewhere tropical. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The Dominican Republic. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes! &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: I invited Kendall and Kylie's best friends, Spencer and Maddy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Sacrifice! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Help me! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think my toe is broken. &gt;&gt; ROB: Bruce was like, "Scott's so unappreciative." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why is he going around talking all this? Like, I heard, like... our relationship? Like we don't have one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who are you meeting from your past? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The person who broke up your marriage with my dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did she? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This makes me sick to my stomach. I lost my appetite. I'm gone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce... &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce... Why are you ignoring me? Bruce. Why are you getting your stuff? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just staying downstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Many reasons why, honey, but I'm staying downstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, okay. Bruce... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Chill out. I don't want to talk about it now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm just going to find another room downstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not listening to my side of the story. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kourtney tells me that Kris hooked up with her old boyfriend, and actually is communicating with the guy. I-- I would never do that to her. I mean, this really hurts. Have a good night. 37 00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:32,358 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have a good night? Really? Bruce! &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt? I want to say good-bye. Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; MASON: Love you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: See you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh... I love you. I love you, Kourt. I'm sad I'm leaving. I'm very happy that I spent some time with my family, but I'm actually excited to be going home to Dallas to see my wonderful, peaceful husband. 49 00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:14,534 This trip was very stressful, and I feel like I need a vacation from this vacation. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; ROB: Are you drunk again? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want to hang out or not? &gt;&gt; KIM: Get in bed. We're going to look at some pics from today. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is just weird. I'm like cuddling by myself, and then you just creeped up behind me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sorry, bro. Backyard's bangin' like a Benzie. &gt;&gt; KIM: I look so fat in these pictures. Honestly, I can't believe it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kim, you're standing next to 14-year-old, 80-pound girls. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's a pretty good one. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, Bruce checking your ass out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's ridiculous! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, he is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ew! It almost looks like he's gonna get a hand on it. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think you should confront him. Wait, listen... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruce? We have to say something to you. Rob, you want to hit the town, or...? &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys are not going out. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not going anywhere. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, why are you guys so boring? I hope somebody kills me out here. Put me out of my misery. Nobody wants to hang out and do anything ever. There's so much tension on this vacation, the only thing I could imagine to make me feel a little better would be a little bit of fun, kind of take this edge off. I just feel like I gotta do something. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go do it. Come on. &gt;&gt; ROB: Wait. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go leave Kim to her studies. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm going to e-mail this to Mom. &gt;&gt; ROB: Do you have a lighter? There's no way I'm going to be able to smoke this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are we gonna do? &gt;&gt; ROB: Let's go walk around there and just like... just throw some rocks real far. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What, at the little girls' room? &gt;&gt; ROB: At the window. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's not that sneaky! Rob, that's not very sneaky. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; GIRL: That was so scary. What is wrong with you guys? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think the prank went pretty well. I mean, I don't know if they peed in their pants, but seemed like they were pretty nervous, and it seemed like they probably won't sleep the rest of the trip. Feel a little guilty about that, but overall, it went very nice. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, good night. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, love you guys. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Yeah, good night. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not wearing shoes. I feel like an ancient Aztec. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, definitely Azzies. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My God, what are you doing sleeping? Let's rock and roll. Why does he get the fun bed upstairs and you don't? That was a funny prank last night on the girls. Were you guys drinking? Real mature. Come on, I don't want to come back here in 15 minutes and see you still in bed. Let's go! Come on! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, that's absurd. Bruce came into the room that Rob and I are staying in. You know, made kind of a wise-ass remark. "What are you, hung over?" What are you passing judgment on? Nobody cares. We're trying to have fun here. 115 00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:27,126 It's a vacation. We gotta lock this door. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to go see Mom. Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: So I wake up this morning, and I see a text message from my mom that says to come up to her room immediately-- it's urgent-- so I have no idea what's going on. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's pretty shocking. &gt;&gt; ROB: Say "Bible" right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bible. Do you want to see? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: And why... you're freaking me out right now. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you ready? &gt;&gt; ROB: Geez... &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh... my gosh. That is crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So you're not gonna sleep all day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The more I sleep, the less time I have to hang out with everybody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is being so selfish. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. Enough bothering me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, whatever. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce, are you still fighting with Mom? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's stupid. The last time I talked to the guy, he calls up and literally wanted to fight me. 138 00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:24,650 Next time I hear from him is 21 years later, and Kris has got his e-mail. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it bad? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, you ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh... my gosh. My mom's lip is just... bizarre. Like she has an allergic reaction to something. It's just disgusting. I love her, but I would never kiss her for like a year. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you allergic to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. But it's so weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, it looks like your lip is gonna explode. : Is that a joke? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can you believe that? Look at that thing. You take some Benadryl? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, and somebody gave me some Claritin. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, try anything. Actually, it's God punishing her for giving Todd your e-mail. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce is usually the one to give me support in any situation. At a time like this, when I'm feeling really vulnerable and kind of scared, and he's going to be mad at me because he can't get over the Todd? I don't think it's fair. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is the Dominican Republic known for plastic surgery? Did you come here to really sneak and get your lips done? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did not get my lips done in the middle of the night, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, let me take a picture from the side. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Turn your head sideways. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want... No! This is mean. You guys are always abusing me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Looks like Daffy Duck. Kourtney needs to see this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Things travel really fast in my family. I feel like... on display. Come see Kris Jenner's lip. : Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh... my God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Is that possible? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Guys, we should leave her, go skeet shooting. Hopefully, by the time we come back, it'll go down. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have fun, you guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll be back. Check your e-mails. Yeah, maybe you got an e-mail from your old lover. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. I'm here to wake you up. Let's have breakfast. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We'll have dinner later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you're not gonna sleep all day. You're so red. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, I want to sleep all day. The more I sleep, the less time I have to hang out with everybody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're gonna lay here all day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hopefully. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's exciting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Want to get this trip over with. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should get up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And enjoy your day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What am I gonna enjoy? Your family is getting a little out of control. Me, you, and Mason should just go somewhere else. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're in a good mood. I want to have breakfast with Scott and Mason, and he snaps at me because he was up all night drinking. It's just annoying. Like it's not even that early. 196 00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,447 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, enough bothering me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, whatever. Hola. ¿Cómo estás? I have a bad lip. Allergic to food. &gt;&gt; MASSEUSE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know what happened. And then I broke my toe. This toe right here. &gt;&gt; MASSEUSE: Mmm, too bad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so I'm kind of a mess. Well, maybe a massage will make... just make me feel better. &gt;&gt; MASSEUSE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a mess. Let's do a little inventory. Got a broken toe, my lip looks like a Who from Whoville, Bruce won't talk to me, and I'm disappointed in this trip, so I'm gonna stay in my room, and I'm gonna get a massage. Oh, that's the spot. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My dad likes to show off, so he's taking us skeet shooting. Whatever that is. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: So do we have someone who would like to go first? &gt;&gt; ROB: Bruiser, just go do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do it. Oh, gives me the big .12 gauge, huh? &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Yeah, you're a big man with big and a big Can't hear me, right? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you think? I got it? All right! &gt;&gt; ROB: What? Good job, Bruce. First try. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I need somebody else to try it here. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ROB:sake. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh! &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Pull. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If you hold it real tight in there, you don't get as much kick. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll try it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Kimberly. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Pull. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't like this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, come on. Just take a couple more. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: One more. &gt;&gt; KIM: One more. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Okay, pull... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't scream. &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR: Pull. Bang. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't even see it. 236 00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,694 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got it. You nailed it. Very good. You nailed it. &gt;&gt; MASON: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Push it. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; MASON: I do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, should we put sand in here? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. I'm all dirty. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, go like this. Look. Scott is being so selfish just sleeping off his hangover all day. He should be outside enjoying the beautiful day with family. 246 00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:43,302 You know, we're on a family vacation. You okay? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Anyone here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is it getting bigger? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just kind of crazy, and I can't eat anything or drink anything. So no negative waves. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, I don't know what else to do. I can't go out of the room 'cause everybody will stare at me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Have a nice day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, yeah. I'll just be here, lounging 257 00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:24,209 around in my pajamas. Whoo-hoo. : Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my gosh, you're making music. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce, are you still fighting with Mom? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, no, I mean, I'm not fighting with her. Just disappointed that she would get that stupid guy's e-mail address. I mean, the last time I talked to the guy, when we first started dating, he calls up and literally was like... wanted to fight me. This little wimp. I thought, "Who is this guy?" You know, next time I hear from him, it's 21 years later, and Kris has got his e-mail. You know, just stupid. Would you say to the guy, if he had kind of done all that to you, would you say, "Oh, here's my e-mail"? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everyone else is in turmoil around us at all times. Life's too short for you to sit around wondering if I saw my ex-boyfriend again or not. &gt;&gt; KIM: By the way, I heard you peed in the trash can last night in the kitchen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I literally just want to go home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Go home. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right,it. I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, you're not leaving. 279 00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:41,987 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I don't want to be here; everybody bothers me for every little thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mase, look. Oh, my gosh, I caught a fish. &gt;&gt; MASON: Do it again. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What happened? That's so much water. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Mase. &gt;&gt; KIM: By the way, I heard you peed in the trash can last night in the kitchen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There was no bathroom nearby. &gt;&gt; ROB: It was the funniest thing in the world. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For a teenager. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not a grown father. &gt;&gt; ROB: He was eating a salad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A grown father peeing in a trash can? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh. my gosh, look what you guys are doing right now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I could really use a beer right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really don't think you need to be drinking in the middle of the day. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is exactly why I didn't want to get out of bed. Now I have all these people nagging me at all times. I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind here. Oh, I literally just want to go home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Go home. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right,it. I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott, are you serious? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, you guys are idiots. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not a little kid. I don't even want to be on these stupid family trips anyway. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I really don't know what's going on with Scott. He uses every excuse to just be by himself, but I almost don't care. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is there any flights for me to get back to L.A. today, direct? Honestly, I just feel like I'm just done. I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, you're not leaving. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I don't want to be here; everybody bothers me for every little thing. I literally hate... &gt;&gt; MASON: Where's he going? 312 00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:43,408 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All I want to do, I just want to get out of here and just go home. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So where'd Scott go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that his thing? Just getting up and leaving? Are you willing to deal with all of this for the rest of your life? I went to the hotel, found out where Scott is staying. It's time to talk. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, are you annoyed at all? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I mean, it's typical. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're a rat. You're a real like snitch. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not a snitch. &gt;&gt; ROB: You just were. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause I was trying to tell him, "don't pee in our trash can"? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, in front of Kourtney, and you know how much Kourtney scolds him over the dumbest &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I didn't... I didn't even think that Kourtney was listening. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know what, it's my fault for even telling you anything. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, so you're the snitch. &gt;&gt; ROB: Keep your mouth shut about that stuff, for the 30th time in like a minute. Talk about politics, be smart, educate yourself, talk to your family about how their vacation is. Kim, first of all, needs to keep her mouth shut. Second, like Kourtney just needs to not take such a dumb, stupid situation like he was drunk, goes peeing. Like, thathappens all the time. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's just so lazy. 339 00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,751 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He was already annoying today. He was sleeping all day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Mason? I don't want to scare him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mason, you want to see what happened to Grandma? She got an ouchie. What happened, Grandma? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's okay. It doesn't hurt, Mason. It's just funny, isn't it? I think it's about time I stop feeling sorry for myself. So I've called a nurse to come over and check out my lip and see if there's something they can give me so I can get out and about and enjoy the rest of the vacation. Hi. Hola. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; FEMALE NURSE: I am fine. Oh, is it inflammatory? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just woke up like this. &gt;&gt; MALE NURSE: Did you eat something or...? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; MALE NURSE: You only have the inflammation? It don't, uh, hurt? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. There's no pain. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is she saying? &gt;&gt; MALE NURSE: An anti-allergic she will give you. See how it works. Keep ice on your... on your lip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; MALE NURSE: And each 12 hours, you need to take one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; MALE NURSE: Have a nice day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does anyone know where Scott went? Did he go home? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't understand what happened. Is Scott coming back? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where is he? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have no idea. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're not gonna call him? &gt;&gt; KIM: See, that's the thing about Kourtney is she doesn't care. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I care, but I have Mason to worry about and other things going on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So where'd Scott go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Probably to the other hotel. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. I mean, I said he shouldn't be drinking in the middle of the day, and Kim said that he peed in a trash can last night when he was drunk, and he stormed off. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He certainly has pulled this before. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I mean, he didn't do anything that crazy. We weren't like mad at what he did. We were just saying it's not a good look. If you're gonna be a father of two kids, like that's not cute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But we weren't like mad or yelling or... you know? And then he's like, "I hate it here. I just want to go home." So I said, "Fine, so go." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that his thing? Just getting up and leaving all the time? He did it at the car race. He-- I don't get it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He leaves the situation if he feels like he's gonna... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He can't face up to things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you willing to deal with all of this for the rest of your life? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like he gets better overall. Like his tantrums aren't as bad. Normally, that would've been like crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know if he's just like some spoiled kid or what. I... I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going to get a water. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye. Well, I feel sorry for Kourtney. You know, it's tough being in a difficult relationship like that. It just makes kind of every day a strain. And she doesn't know every day when she gets up what type of person she's gonna have to deal with that day. It's ridiculous. I feel like I should go talk to Scott 'cause I still have unfinished business. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Then go talk to him, honey. You've got to say what you want to say. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I don't want to criticize him. I just want to be able to say something to kind of help him out. And how to deal with people. Life's too short. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, and life's too short for you to sit around wondering if I saw my ex-boyfriend again or not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So did you actually like meet up with him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I didn't meet up with him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. So you just have to trust me to realize that I'm not gonna see-- &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, honey, I've always trusted you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, then drop it. Everyone else is in turmoil around us at all times, and we're the two people that are supposed to keep it together. So let's keep it together. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Boy, here I am going on and on about Scott walking out on Kourtney, but, you know, really, I guess I walked out on Kris, too. How can you not love a girl with a lip like that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That is the strangest lip. Okay, I'll make up with you. I'll actually kiss the lip. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, would that do it? I love you, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How do I get in? How do I do this? Do I come from the bottom up? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just don't laugh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God, that's a cold lip. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We started doing music videos years ago. So we always do one. Every family trip, Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, everyone's into it. So this trip is perfect backdrop, everything for this music video. Go. Okay, it's recording. So you're gonna walk over there. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Try one more time. &gt;&gt; 443 00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:15,266 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Go back to nine seconds. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Want to learn how to shake your ass in the water? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God, this is 447 00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:28,747 some music video theme. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: In any relationship, communication is extremely important. And Scott walked out on me. He certainly has walked out on Kourtney on many occasions, and just all of a sudden leaves. It's extremely irresponsible. I found out where Scott is staying. It's time to talk. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why don't we all make fun of Mom. Oh, my gosh, my lip. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does this even look like anything? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It looks like something like that's mean and nasty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just leaving is not the way to deal with it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Truthfully, I'm scared every single day that I'm gonna 461 00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:15,660 wake up and she's gonna tell me it's over. I'm scared to do anything. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just, uh, don't worry about them. I just want to talk to you. Actually, I was gonna talk to you tonight, but... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not looking to be in an altercation with you. I mean... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Nobody's getting upset. I'm not mad at you. Hopefully, you're not mad at me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want to have that conversation, but what the hell happened today? That's like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. It just seems like, no matter what, there's always something somebody can find wrong with me, you know? And it's like I feel like I've changed a lot about myself over the years to try to be a better person, be a better father, but somehow, no matter what I do, there's always something that somebody's not happy with me about, and it sucks, and it tires me out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And the way I look at it is... just leaving is not the way to deal with it. And you have done a lot of that. Okay, if everything isn't going right, what does Scott do? I don't deal with it, I leave. And I can give you a lot of examples. Obviously, at the race. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Maybe I am a little too sensitive sometimes, but something happened earlier at the track that made me kind of take a step back from our relationship. You introduced your sons, and then you said, "This is my son Burt, this is my son "Brandon, oh, and my friend Scott." And somebody came up to me and said, "Hey, your acquaintance Bruce is over there," like teasing me as if you could care less about me. It got me sensitive, Bruce, it did. I don't have a family out here. You know, it's just tough for me. Kourtney doesn't even want to marry me. It's not like we're really married and you're my real father-in-law or nothing. I'm just left as the outsider. I changed a lot of who I was, and being selfish, and doing things for myself because all I wanted to do is make Kourtney happy. And truthfully, I'm scared every single day that I'm gonna wake up and she's gonna tell me it's over because I did one little thing. I'm scared to do anything. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've never really had a long conversation with Scott, but, uh, I'm realizing, you know what, he is a very sensitive guy. I understand how he feels. And being part of the family, I mean, yeah, he's Mason's dad, and the next one's dad, but they've never really gotten married. And so he has always stayed a little bit on the outside. I can feel his frustration, but he's just got to learn how to deal with that. I have told people all the time that Scott has done very well with the drinking thing. You have stayed away from, although you have a little bit here and there, it isn't where it was a few years ago. And you've been a good dad. You've been there for Mason. The only thing I'm saying is just, you know, be sensitive to other people. Do the best you possibly can. You know, that's all you can do, and don't just leave the situation. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I totally understand where Bruce is coming from. I agree running away from my problems, it's not the best habit, and I need to kind of deal with them right there and then and not run away because they're too difficult. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Calm down. Take Kourtney off to the side. Talk calmly. Deal with it. 525 00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:28,319 Just sitting over here in a hotel all by yourself is not gonna fix anything. Honey, the lip, it hasn't affected your drinking, has it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm trying to make sure it doesn't. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, it looks a little better. Yeah, it's going down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It does? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So what did Scott say? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, he kind of feels bad. He feels like such an outsider, and I can't blame him, you know? I think it'd be tough. He's been in this family for what, six years now, two kids, still not married. Kourtney's playing her games with him. He never feels quite worthy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, that makes me feel bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That he doesn't feel like part of the family. I want him to feel loved, and he is the father of my grandchildren. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I totally agree, but this is a tough family. It's difficult. I-- I don't blame him. I think it'd be difficult. You know, he's gonna have to deal with that, and walking away from things is not the right way to deal with it, you know? What's the deal with Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is he gonna come back? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think so. We'll see if it happens. I'm gonna go take a shower. We're going to dinner? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're going to dinner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: With that lip, we're going to dinner? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just go take a shower. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That lip doesn't hurt your cussing, does it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. You want to sit? &gt;&gt; MASON: Hi, donkey. Hello. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mason. &gt;&gt; DONKEY KEEPER: No problem. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you on the donkey? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mase, say cheese to Kiki. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You made it. Okay, can you walk now? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't stand next to you when you're that tall. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, it's okay. Take a picture with me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Oh, my God, that's insane. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And she's so skinny and I look so large. So I heard you talked to Scott? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, I had some things off my chest that I got off, and he got some things off his chest, and, uh, you know, it was good. You know, Scott's a good guy. He just... Scott never really feels like he's part of the family. I mean, I don't blame him. I think it'd be difficult. But I also told him I think I've been proud of him. I think he's done a great job as a dad, and he's been there for Mason and you, and, you know, that's all good stuff. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I mean, he's definitely a different person than he was. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm really surprised that Bruce, out of all people, is the one who went and talked to Scott about this. Now Bruce is saying that Scott's feeling insecure and that he feels disposable and that I need to, you know, make him feel better. It's... this is like all very confusing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I hope he'll come tonight. 582 00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,676 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But we'll wait and see. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, is that the train coming? &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm making... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, don't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, he just ate the whole stick of butter. And now he's rubbing it all over his face and his hair. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Help him, Kourtney. I mean, Kendall. &gt;&gt; MASON: I eat the butter, Mommy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I saw, but now you got butter all over your face and your hair. &gt;&gt; MASON: I eat my butter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-oh, look who's here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, look who it is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Back in action. It's gonna be a whole pain in my ass. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Robbie, Scotty. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 29, never been kissed. &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, good to see you, Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks, Bruiser. Usually, I'd probably just try to hide from the problems as long as I could, but after Bruce and I had our talk, I decided I got to suck it up and just enjoy myself as much as I can. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's it going? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You look beautiful. Did you have some work done? Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My lips blew up because I had a food allergy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh. Oh, nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a big lip. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I do appreciate you putting this trip together. I don't want you to think that I'm not grateful, I just... Sometimes things are hard for me, you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I can sit here at dinner with a lip like out to here, like Jim Carrey... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's pretty crazy, but it's fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Then, uh, you can be just fine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think it's actually nice; it makes you vulnerable for once. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. The fact that I actually came out tonight was a big deal, but it's also a big deal that you came out tonight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do agree with my mom that, you know, it took a lot for Scott to come to the family dinner. It shows a lot of maturity that 621 00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:59,790 he would show up, knowing that everyone probably has something bad to say. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh, my lip. Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob, that's really not that funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does this even look like anything? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? Yeah, it looks like something. It looks like something like that's mean and nasty and rude. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I agree. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does it look hot? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's mean the way you guys treat me. 631 00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:26,517 I can't help what's going on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob, be respectful to your mom. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shake it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You should ask Mom to dance. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KIM: Go for it. You should. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, honey. Dancing with the Stars. That's all I have to say. I'm dangerous when I dance. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You look like a cat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I like it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I swear, we talk better on text. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So just write me later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, we can talk when we get back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm pretty drained. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, we can talk tomorrow. But I do think we need to talk. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I agree. I'm ready to talk whenever you are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The whole reason I had another kid with you is because you agreed to get married, but obviously, you're so indecisive and you go back on your word that I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna keep trying with you forever. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, am I going in the back? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're going in the front. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: In the front? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, get up here and sit down. Take it out. I feel bad. Scott's had a tough week with this family, and I know what Scott's going through. And, you know, I feel it's like my responsibility to make Scott feel included in the family. I mean, the bottom line is he's a good guy and, you know, we'll go do a little kayaking, have a little bit of fun, and kind of just enjoy life. There. &gt;&gt; MASON: Iguana. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, iguana. He knows iguana? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, 'cause we have an iguana at our house, and it won't talk to him, and he gets very upset. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know, um, I'll tell you one of your problems with Scott is always gonna be... you're gonna have that problem that you had yesterday over and over and over again unless you just kind of realize that if you never commit to him and you make him feel insecure... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're in a relationship with two kids. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You turn down every offer he's ever made you, so he feels like you're gonna... he's disposable. I feel like this happened the last time Kourtney was pregnant. She's overwhelmed, and I'm sure she's tired, and she doesn't want to deal with the reality of Scott. So I'm kind of feeling bad for Scott, and that's why I've encouraged Kourtney to maybe go out and get him something special so that he will feel loved and accepted. Why don't you get him a love ring to match his love bracelet? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, what the hell does that mean? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It means, "I promise to spend the rest of my life committed to you," so he feels like he's actually part of the family. I'm not asking you to marry him, but I'm just asking you to make a commitment and make him feel good about himself. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, I will. I do admit that I'm not the most expressive person. Maybe my mom's right, and I should get him a little symbol to show how much I do love him. Okay, thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I ask you a question? I mean, not to make you feel bad, but do you ever do anything nice for him? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, first of all, you should talk. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I get mad at Bruce and I'm annoyed with him constantly, but then I'll like bust a motorcycle out of my ass and give it to him, and he gets so excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey. Don't you look nice? I told you to get all dressed up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you look cute. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And your lip actually... the lip from hell looks relatively normal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, right? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, since it's our last night, you know, me and the kids planned a little surprise. You look wonderful. Let's go downstairs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's the surprise? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, just a little something. Kris has worked so hard to put this whole vacation together and organizing everything and, you know, Kourtney having problems getting here and finding other flights. I mean, it has been nonstop. It's time to appreciate all of that and give Kris a good dinner, and I hope and have told all the kids to be on their best behavior-- no fat lip jokes. &gt;&gt; What is going on? What?! Para bailar la bamba, baby. I'd say we sit down and eat. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! This is amazing. Whoa, yeah. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks, everybody. This is so great. To another great vacay with the fam. Here you go, Scotty. Cheers, everybody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bruce decided to throw this big dinner for my mom. You know, we were all annoyed with her over the situation of her being in touch with Todd, but my mom planned this whole family vacation. Even with her broken toe and her swollen lip, she still has the best time and makes sure that we're all having so much fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I say we do the peak and the pit of our trip. The peak of my trip is just that, Mom, I want to... I'm very thankful that you've set this whole thing up and that, even though we torture you a little bit, we love you, and then the pit of my trip is these damn bug bites. &gt;&gt; I think my pit is my broken toe and, for sure, my swollen lip, and I think the... the peak of my trip is right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Peaks-- one, seeing Khloe here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, that was great. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Other peaks-- as a parent, I love it when my kids like uncontrollably laugh. It just makes my heart feel good. Another peak is, actually, I had a real nice conversation with Scott. You know, Scott's part of the family, it's extremely important, and I appreciated the talk. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was a nice one. Thank you, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My pit was traveling here and also Scott's little temper tantrum storming off, but it also made me realize, you know, you're not disposable and I don't want you to feel that way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is Kourtney expressing emotion at the table in front of other people? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Never happen. Uh, Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pit was coming here that travel day. Peak would be watching Kendall and Kylie create their new little movie, and watching them get older is kind of fun 'cause I'm gonna have a daughter, and, you know, when I met them, they were like 4 feet tall and now they're like 6 feet tall, so I I get a kick out of that. You know, I watch their attitude against you, and I feel bad knowing that my daughter is gonna be a little bitch to my little girl at one point, but that's part of life and it's not simple, and I know they love you so much and I really enjoy seeing how much they love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And that's why we love you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I hear you, thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think we did a good job, family, another vacation. Whoo! &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just wanted to say that I know that I'm indecisive. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I'm not indecisive with you, and I'm obviously committed to us even though we're not like getting married, and I thought that that was like understood. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The whole reason I had another kid with you is because you agreed to get married if we had another kid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But not while I'm pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, but now I'm over it. You broke the contract. You broke the deal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What was the deal? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The deal was, if you wanted to have another kid... Doesn't matter. Whatever, anything, but obviously, you're so indecisive and you go back on your word that I'm not gonna keep trying with you forever. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're so indecisive and you go back on your word that I'm not gonna keep trying, with you forever. I had the one kid, and then you said you didn't want to be with me unless I had another one. I said, "Okay, well, if we have another child, I think it's fair that we get married." You said yes, you got pregnant. I said, "Any thoughts of getting married?" You said no. I go, "Okay, great." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't say no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, you did. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But also, there's things that we're still working on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You have a perfect excuse right there to never proceed with our relationship. You don't know what it's like for me. I love everybody, yeah, but like it's just a lot of strong people in one house. It's... it's a lot to handle for anybody, and I do these things for you, but it's not like you ever show me any appreciation, a "thank you for being there with my family." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do see Scott's point that sometimes I don't appreciate him, and Scott does make me happy. I mean, I am committed to Scott if that means I don't want to be with anyone else. I want to be with him, and I want it to work with him. Sometimes just don't understand how he doesn't know that. My mom and I went shopping today to find something like a promise-- something to like show you like commitment 'cause... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're kidding, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sometimes like a symbol is better. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I appreciate the gesture. Ow, I have no circulat... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's staying, staying on there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It really complements my watch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It matches your shorts. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sometimes Kourtney does surprise me, and, you know, she hasn't been that spontaneous in a long time, but the fact that she told me in front of her whole family how much she loves me and how committed she is to our family makes me feel good, and it's a very cute idea-- this love bracelet. It obviously doesn't go with my gold accessories, but if it did, I would always wear it. I love the thought. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on, Scott. Come on, please, one dance. If you love me, if you love me, 815 00:41:59,182 --> 00:42:08,258 come on. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, Director Kylie, what do we need on the boat? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Uh, us dancing, like just being cool. This trip has been so fun, and what better way to end it than 822 00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:43,994 getting on the boat, getting crazy for our music video. &gt;&gt; ♫♫♫ &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is the best part of the trip, for sure. Next on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott got offered to do some sweet 16. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ♫ Happy birthday Happy... ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Welcome home. Now that Khloe's back, everything is going to be happy again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you going to come to New York? To Scott's restaurant opening? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My family has been pulling me in a million different directions. People don't get how much [bleep] I'm put under.
