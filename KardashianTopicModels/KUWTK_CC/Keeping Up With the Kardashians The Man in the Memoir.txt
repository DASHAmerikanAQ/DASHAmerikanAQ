- &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, take a 3 00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:08,108 picture of the two of us. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's up? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're texting a picture of us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you know that you have sent me probably three texts since we've been married? Like, you've never sent me a sexy text ever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: God. Honey, is that what you need to get off on now? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You got to learn to spice it up a little bit. We're gonna do a food association game. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What does this remind you of, honey? Tell me, baby. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Soup? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's so incredibly repulsive. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And what does these remind you of? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bread, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What does this remind you of? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, I can't eat anymore. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Lamar? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. 22 00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:58,091 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How am I doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You just failed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's up, babe? You want to go out to dinner tonight somewhere, like, Mastro's or something? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just ate frozen yogurt. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, we'll go to dinner in a couple hours. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's late. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 'Cause you go to bed at 10:00 at night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I typically go to bed between 9:00 and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...9:30. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...11:00. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, you're, like, 100. I wish I could go to sleep that early. I'm just not built that way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So go enjoy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna go by myself to a dinner? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Every time we go out, you have to go, like, all out or nothing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And then I get pissed, and I don't need to be up waiting and wondering where you are. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sometimes I feel a little cooped up and want to kind of get out and socialize. And going out somewhere fun to Kourtney would be, like, a pregnancy class. But don't you understand that I have FOMO? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know what 45 00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,387 that is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: "Fear Of Missing Out." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'll be right down in one sec. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you just make a pee-pee? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think your diaper wasn't on good, and it just leaked all over me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! Whoo! Fuchsia-buchsia.bump. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe... Oh, my God. Khloe's in town just for a couple days, so she invited Kourtney and I over for some sister time. Come on, Mase. One, two, three. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is Scott, by the way? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He was not in the mood to come. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, whenever he says he wants to go be social, and then whenever we're doing something... &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...he never wants to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where does Scott want to go? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, where does he want to go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He always says: Who am I gonna drive to town to eat with? No one would meet me halfway, but you would. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys should go out together. When Scott goes out, he goes all out, especially with his friends. He always takes it to the next level, so at least if he goes out with Kim, I know that he's not gonna get crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Then the rumors will start. "Kim and Scott boning." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let those rumors happen, honey. I could care less. &gt;&gt; KIM: 'Cause he's so my type. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's so your type. &gt;&gt; KIM: That muscular body 78 00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,730 of his? Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: I am here. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Good. Then you have it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Perfect! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm excited because I get to take a lesson with a proper instructor. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: That's it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah! It feels really good to be able to make any noise I want to make, and nobody's gonna judge me. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Perfect. Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is kind of a good thing to get your aggression out. Thank you! Whoo! &gt;&gt; CHRIS: That's very good. Very good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. That was fun. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: It was really good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who is that guy in the black shirt? &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Todd Waterman. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Todd Waterman? Toddy Waterman... really? The Todd Waterman that I left Robert Kardashian for. I just can't seem to escape my past lately. It's been over 23 years since I've even laid eyes on him, but, suddenly, it feels like yesterday. I'm gonna get a drink of water really quick. I'll be right back. I'm gonna have a panic attack right now. Hey, Todd. &gt;&gt; TODD: What's up, Kris? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so yucky. How are you? &gt;&gt; TODD: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. Good to see you. &gt;&gt; TODD: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A little, uh, stinky, but that's okay. That was, I want to come back. It's great exercise. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CHRIS: I mean, most people play here, obviously, are from the area. There are quite a few even from Branford. I was really crazy about Todd, and Todd was really crazy about me, but I think that Todd was very, very young and probably way too young to settle down with one person. Bye, you. See you later. Bye. Thank you so much. He looked like he wanted to talk to me. I don't know what's going on, but I'm just gonna wait over here for a second. &gt;&gt; TODD: Are you gonna leave? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. What's going on? &gt;&gt; TODD: Everything's good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good! I'm all right. &gt;&gt; TODD: I'm shaking now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; TODD: You look fantastic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks. &gt;&gt; TODD: Do I look older? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you look good. &gt;&gt; TODD: A little white in the beard? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That means that you've, um... &gt;&gt; TODD: ...aged. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...hopefully learned something and aged and matured and all that &gt;&gt; TODD: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When I did write about him in my memoir, I didn't want to expose his identity because I would never compromise his privacy. But he came out and talked about our relationship. &gt;&gt; TODD: A lot of that stuff that came out, they really twist the hell out of it. I just wanted you to know that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like I would never have said your name in a book. &gt;&gt; TODD: I sent you e-mails, and you never responded. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, that's, I don't have that anymore. I have, um, Noelle... .com. &gt;&gt; TODD: It was good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. I am all greasy. &gt;&gt; TODD: I'm not gonna want to let go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I smell. You should. You should want to let go. I stink. &gt;&gt; TODD: What is it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: n-o-e-l-l-e@ com. &gt;&gt; TODD: &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; TODD: I'll never remember. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go write it down. &gt;&gt; TODD: Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See you later. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. You're never gonna believe what just happened to me. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So I go to Toluca Lake Tennis Club to take a tennis lesson just now, and this guy looks kind of familiar, so I say to the instructor, "Who's that guy?" And they go, "His name is Todd Waterman." &gt;&gt; NOELLE: No! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes! &gt;&gt; NOELLE: No! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes! Can you guys believe, after 24 years, running into that And then he gave me a hug. And then he says, "I don't want to let go." &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Stop! &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Wait. Are you gonna tell Bruce that you ran into him? Well, of course, I'm gonna tell Bruce. I feel like I have to tell Bruce. Bruce has been part of this story since, you know, I met him. Bruce was there when I was breaking up with Todd. He's familiar with the whole story. He gets it. He said, "What's your e-mail?" And I said, "It's noelle@ com." So you might get some steamy 169 00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:22,008 e-mails from Todd today. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, bugs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's on your mind, tootsie roll? I was just gonna tell you that I made plans for you since you're always so bored and looking to do something. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're doing something? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. I made plans for you to go with Kim into the social scene. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: By ourself? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. Aren't you excited to go out? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kim stays out for an hour. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. That's what a normal person does. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think Kourtney thinks I can't really get into any trouble because I'm with her sister. But you know, at least it gets me out of the house a little bit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get ready for a night to remember. 186 00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,232 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're a real weird chick. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Daddy? Honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Would you turn that off for a minute? I just want to talk to you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: About what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: About something. I just want to close the door 'cause I don't want the kids to hear me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: About what? They can hear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want them to hear this. Um, I just went and had a tennis lesson. And I see this guy that kind of looked familiar. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I said to the 200 00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,506 instructor, "Who is that?" And he said, "Todd Waterman." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No way. The last time I talked to this guy was right after I had met Kris. And he was literally calling me out on the phone, ready to fight me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And he came out and said, "Can I have a minute?" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would have told him off. Wish I was there. 20 years later? Why would she even talk to him? She never should have done that. &gt;&gt; KIM: You want to see some? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What?! Next. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why do you want to play with fire? Why would you want to see him again? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a few things I'd like to say to him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Meaning what? 216 00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,779 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got divorced. I left my husband for this guy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He came out and said, "Can I have a minute?" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would've told him off. Wish I was there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just very calmly said, "I wouldn't have done it the way you did it, and I think that you were disrespectful." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've never had secrets or been shady with Bruce, so I'm certainly not gonna start now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So how did you leave it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I said good-bye, I hugged him good-bye. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, what did you hug him for? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. And then he goes, "I don't want to let go." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So did you get his number or something? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I didn't get his number. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. E-mail address? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I gave him Noelle's. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why did you even give him that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can't just tell him I'm not gonna give him my information. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I gave him Noelle's e-mail address. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you get his? Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I didn't get his. What do I want his e-mail for? I really don't feel like there was anything wrong with me sharing an e-mail address with Todd. I'm not doing anything or concealing or hiding or sneaking around. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He was a scumbag back then, he still is. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Raoul. What up? &gt;&gt; RAOUL: What's going on, my brother? Looking sharp there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What up, brother? &gt;&gt; KIM: T.S. in the building. &gt;&gt; RAOUL: How you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just kidding. Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; RAOUL: How you doing, beautiful? &gt;&gt; WAITRESS: Hi, welcome to STK. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love Kim, but, you know, she's, like, the most boring person ever. &gt;&gt; KIM: Did you guys used to have a salad that was, like, with pears in it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So I invited my friend Raoul that could have fun with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Think if I'm 40 and I don't have any kids and I'm not married, I would have a baby, like, artificially inseminated. In a sperm bank, do they show pictures? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would feel like Mary, like Jesus is my baby, you know? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I remember when a dude would meet a chick by going up to her and saying, "Man, you're beautiful." That's what I did with Kourtney. It wasn't like I met her on the Internet. &gt;&gt; RAOUL: I'm scared of that Internet &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Really! We should go on that. Have you ever been on Chatroulette, on the Internet? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's ridic-- we've got to do it. Chatroulette-- it's basically like an iChat with people you don't know. And you never know what you're gonna get. I mean, you could get some young kids partying in a college dorm, or you could get some old man jerking it. You could Twitter "Jumping on Chatroulette." &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott Disick and I will be on in, like, an hour. Get yourready. 275 00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,124 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm tweeting that, for sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, like, won't even let Scott go out with his friends, so I'm determined to let him have fun tonight. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, buddy! You know my friend Kimmy? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys! &gt;&gt; MAN: You ever been told you look like Kim Kardashian? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No! But I've been told I look like Scott Disick all the time. Next. Oh, man! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys! &gt;&gt; KIM: What's up? &gt;&gt; GIRL: What?! &gt;&gt; KIM: You want to see some ? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wouldn't say Kim is my first choice of a partner to go out with, but at the same time, I can't believe how much Kim has come around since her marriage. I'm definitely liking this new Kim. Next. Oh, yeah, jerk sesh! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I saw his &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, babe! Shake it up, baby. Shake it, shake it, shake it. 297 00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,646 You don't get this kind of comedy. Whoa. Look at that little getup. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You've seen it before. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I saw it when you had no stomach. But now that you're tying it up, it's beautiful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How was your night? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was good, it was funny. We went out for a little bit, just hung out, laughed, and then went back to Kim's and went online and did that, um, Chatroulette thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I saw that on Twitter that you guys did that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was so, so, so funny. She flashed somebody. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: With her brassiere. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's weird. Did they ask? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, they didn't say, "Show me your," but she was just like, pow, pow. It's like dy-no-mite. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's bizarre. This night that Kim and Scott had sounds very interesting. I hope that Scott got his little nightlife itch out of his system. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, they used to call me the social butterfly, 318 00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,838 and I'm flying again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Don't leave me, just in case I croak. At least I have life insurance. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; NOELLE: You're gonna die. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; NOELLE: What's "Snooka"? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, he did not e-mail you. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: This is all he wrote. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Snooka." He wants to know, "Is this your e-mail?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Snooka-- it's a little nickname that Todd gave me, 25 years ago. He used to call me Snooka. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: It's a pet name? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. He never called me Kris, he called me Snooka. My name was Snooka. Don't laugh, Jesse. It's not funny. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: What should we write back? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so write back, write back, "Hi, Todd. Kind of weird that I have never run into you in 24 years. Life has been really good to both of us." &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "And for that, I'm grateful. I wish you nothing but good things. All the best, Kris." &gt;&gt; NOELLE: I mean, what do you think he wants from you? I mean, by e-mailing. 345 00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,421 I mean, do you think he wants to see you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney usually gets pretty worried when I'm out and kind of always wants me to check in. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is she really calling you again? She's stalking you! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It makes me angry that I still even have tears... &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...after all this time. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: And I hate seeing you like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Jesse said there's been a big coyote wandering around, and it ate, like, a bunch of people's dogs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, so she's like, be careful with Mason and stuff. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, look who's texting me: Kim. Wants to go out again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, right. I'm sure you wrote Kim and said, "Kim..." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Actually, no. She wrote me and goes, "Let's go out. Are you ready? Round two." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so call her on speaker. I want to hear. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just call her on speaker. I just want to hear what she has to say. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's unbelievable you don't believe that your own sister wants to hang out with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you really text Scott to go out with him again? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, that's what I said. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, 'cause I said... &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a problem? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I said, I feel like he told you to text him so that he could have an excuse to go... &gt;&gt; KIM: Why would I cover up for your boyfriend, or try to be shady to my pregnant sister? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I said! I mean, I wish I could say I was surprised that Kim invited me out again, but I'm not. I mean, who wouldn't want to hang out with me? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine, go out, have fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney is trying to pretend that she's not upset, but in actuality, she's just jealous that it's not her. All right, I'll call you later to confirm our plans. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, bye. Are you sorry? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not sorry. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you admit that I'm a hot item? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're such a hot item. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I'm talking about. Hit me with a chip-chop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I did something to my wrist yesterday. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was probably 394 00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:20,640 'cause you were jerking me off all night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Noelle, you want a glass of champagne? &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Sure! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just kidding. We can't keep forgetting to eat. We're gonna waste away to nothing. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Um, so your friend Todd wrote back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, he did not. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yep. And, um, apparently, he felt like your initial, you know, run-in was a little awkward, so he wants to meet up with you. 404 00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:56,342 &gt;&gt; KRIS: No kidding. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: You want to read? &gt;&gt; KRIS: "If you really want to reflect and cover some serious topics, I'd be open to that." 408 00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,554 &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Always, Todd." &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Do you want to meet... meet up with him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. It's very confusing. I mean, I still think about him from time to time. My life is really happy now. I'm content. I'm in a really good place. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It could be bad to have a meeting with him. I'm not sure if there was any resolution to the actual breakup of Todd and I. And I found myself weeks later in a relationship with Bruce Jenner, and there's a lot of stuff that's unfinished. Let's not write him back. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want to write him back until I have the time to think about what I want to say. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Okay. All right, let me know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. Thanks, Noelle. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Sure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that how you usually drive? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're a hood bitch these days. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I always drive like this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Straight-up gangster. &gt;&gt; KIM: Always have and always will. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: With your elbow, just straight up...? That's really... Never in a million years did I think Kim would be my so-called partner in crime with going out, but all of a sudden, she's got a new little bounce in her step. &gt;&gt; KIM: Woo-hoo! We're going out! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Keep on partying. Keep on rocking. There it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, this has been eating away at me. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm bugged because all this e-mailing going back and forth, and the more I think about it, the more I really... I want to just text him, and say, "You know what, yeah, I do want to talk." I think, sometimes, for me, I don't deal with things and I block them out of my head. The breakup of Todd and I was so quick and almost cold turkey, and what I think I need right now is a little bit of closure. I feel like I have something to say. I feel like it doesn't need to be said through e-mail. You know, there's that little file up here in my head that still has his name on it, and I don't want to have any regrets. Don't want to cry. It makes me angry that I still even have tears. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: After all this time. It sucks. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: And I hate seeing you like this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I just... I can't sleep anymore. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I really can't. I just have to get it off my chest. I don't want to have something I really need to say to somebody and not have the opportunity to say, "This is what I feel like you did to me. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is how it made me feel." I think that all these things are being churned up inside my brain, and I don't think I know how to handle it. I'm just overwhelmed. And when I get overwhelmed, I get really emotional. I just need to get this out of my head. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: So do it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think I'm just gonna pass out at Kim's. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come home like a normal person. I definitely don't want to be sitting at home alone, especially when I'm pregnant. You're a grown man, you can figure it out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, calm down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was thinking about just seeing him one more time. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to still be married? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. 475 00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,637 &gt;&gt; KIM: Then stay far away from him. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, man, how you doing? How's everything? &gt;&gt; KIM: I used to come here all the time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Cheers! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It would be hard for me to say who's more fun to go out with between Kourtney and Kim. Obviously, right now, Kim. I don't think Kourtney really appreciates what I bring to the table. Kourtney keeps calling me. It's too loud to hear anything, though. &gt;&gt; KIM: Text her back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney usually gets pretty worried when I'm out and kind of always wants me to check in and make sure I'm okay, which is understandable. I mean, from time to time, I can get a little out of control. But I would just think when I'm with her sister, she would know I'm safe. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is she really calling you again? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's still up? I can't believe she's still 494 00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,849 awake. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's stalking you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look who finally calls. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, what's up, Pooh Bear? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. I think I'm just gonna pass out at Kim's, 'cause I had a couple beers, and I'm not gonna drive home like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, I think you're a little bit old for slumber parties, especially at my sister's house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm tired, doll. We live far away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think you should call a car service or figure it out, and come home like a normal person. We don't, like, sleep out at people's houses when you have, like, kids and a family. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, calm down. I'm at your sister's, relax. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I didn't mind when Scott and Kim went out, like, once, but now that this is becoming a little routine, I definitely don't want to be sitting at home alone, especially when I'm pregnant. You're a grown man. You can figure it out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Of course, I'm trying to be a grown man that's responsible. 515 00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,778 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, toodles. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Later. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, bugs. I'm home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Per your request. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good job. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. You're not supposed to wake a pregnant girl. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, well, I'm home, if you need me. I got in a car service right when you wanted me to. I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I love you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm gonna go get some food. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, yo. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey, yo. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are you getting... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God, wait. You're gonna die. This kid, he's, like, the sweetest little thing. He asked me to prom, like, and made a YouTube video. It was the cutest thing. Like, so sweet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: People ask you to prom, Ken... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my tomato sauce. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: That doesn't come out. Okay, we're letting it soak in. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: How do we clean it up? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Towels... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ew. Oh, Kylie, I told you it stains bad. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What do we do? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My mom hates it when Kylie and I eat in the living room, and now I just spilled spaghetti sauce. My mom is gonna kill Kylie and I. Like, actually, what do we do? It's not coming off. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Just don't. You're gonna make it worse. 'Cause we actually don't know what we're doing. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom's not home. That gives us a little time. Dad's never gonna know if we move a piece of furniture on top of the stain, so let's just take this chair and put it here. He'll never know. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We should get these out of this room. I'll take my drink, you take that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm scared that it's gonna, like, stain even more if we wait overnight but we can't go and get her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, do you think it's wrong that I have a mad crush on Alec Baldwin? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's kind of embarrassing, 'cause you're married. I guess you're allowed to have crushes when you're married. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you very much. Speaking of married, Todd wrote this e-mail, saying... &gt;&gt; KIM: He wrote an e-mail to who? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He wrote an e-mail to me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why you're even talking to your ex-boyfriend is just beyond me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was thinking about just kind of seeing him one more time, maybe. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a little scary having my mom run into this guy that changed her life so much. If he was able to break up a marriage with four kids, you just hope that there's no feelings left there. Are you on crack? Seriously? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to still be married? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Then stay far away from him. He already ruined your first marriage. Seriously. What if he begs you, and is like, "Please, let's give it one more shot, Snooka." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just hope you're doing it for, like, the right reasons. You know, you going to tell Bruce? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, I'm going to tell Bruce. &gt;&gt; KIM: What if he says he doesn't want you to meet with him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I'll have to 579 00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,414 cross that bridge when I get to it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie. There's so many, like, crazy instructions that go with this big machine, and I'm just hoping that it works. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This isn't somebody that I met and knew for a week. I got divorced! I left my husband for this guy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know Bruce is gonna kill you. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hello. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Good. &gt;&gt; MAN: How can I help you? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We spilled some, like, spaghetti sauce on our carpet, and we wanted to know... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's white. &gt;&gt; MAN: Is this regular cotton carpet or is it like a wool carpet or...? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You know what? I don't know. &gt;&gt; MAN: Let me show you the safest way we have to solve this. The best bet is gonna be this stuff right here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; MAN: Mix this with hot water right on there. Let it sit for, like, 15 minutes and then come back with a carpet extractor. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We get the extractor today? &gt;&gt; MAN: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kinda intimidating. &gt;&gt; MAN: You, uh, hook up the vacuum hose right here, to this part right here. Release the water, it'll pick up the water and that stand. Don't try to get it too wet, though. The wetter you get, that's just gonna make things worse. Uh, any questions? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No. &gt;&gt; MAN: I'm going to go ring you up real quick. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Look at this thing. These are sick. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There's nothing underneath, right? Like we're not gonna die? &gt;&gt; MAN: They're full of acid. That's how we test them. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, okay. I'm a little intimidated. There's so many, like, crazy instructions that go with this big machine, and I'm just hoping that when I get home, I can figure this out. This better work. &gt;&gt; SHIEVA: You still have to get me that watch that you won at eBay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. Where is it? &gt;&gt; SHIEVA: So I can give it to Roya. I have no idea. But for sure you want to give to give that one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SHIEVA: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, look who's up. Rise and shine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was tired. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sure you were, being up all night, sending me pictures of you and Kim. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I wasn't up all night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You wouldn't answer my text, but you were sending me pictures of you guys, like... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, that's an answer: Isn't a picture worth a thousand words? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, well, this party is over. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What party? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not into staying home by myself every night while you guys are out partying it up. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mase can watch over you; he's a good kid. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wake up in the night, and then I see, is Scott home? Is he not home? I can't sleep as well. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's the difference? I'm in another room. Do you want me to put pillows in my bed, and I can make pretend I'm there? Want me to put a mannequin in there? Order me a mannequin, Shiev. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm calling Kim. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you calling Kim for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm telling her the party's over. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I went out a couple times. I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just wanted to tell you that the party's over. You can find your own boyfriend to hang out with 'cause mine is gonna be at home with his pregnant girlfriend and son. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, for now, relax. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, but he goes out every night; I'm literally in bed by myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can we go party at your house? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's a party. You know, I knew the only reason Kourtney's telling me not to go out anymore with her sister is 'cause she's just jealous that it's not her. But it is kind of cute that Kourtney really just wants me all to herself, and I can't blame her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, find your own boyfriend. Toodles. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow! 661 00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:12,174 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, roll it in. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Go this way. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Why? Why do we go this way? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: 'Cause we can't carry this up the stairs. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's the same either way. You're just gonna drag this whole thing through the house and scrape the carpet? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, Kendall, there's a stair; there's a stair... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm just going to be waiting for you inside. I'm not gonna come in through the door. 673 00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:39,734 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; KYLE: You know, twist that. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's not gonna work. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, just leave it, leave it-- it's good. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's good, Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, there, just leave it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall! Do it now. Do it now before you do it wrong again. It's going, it's going. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's moving, it's moving. Ahh! Stop! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We forgot to spray it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Whoa! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That worked really well. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's so cool! This machine, it's Heaven brought to this earth. The stain literally came out in one little swipe once we got it to work. Wait. Turn it off. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Did we rip it up? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: A little. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think that's kinda worse than the spaghetti, Kendall. What do we do? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is getting worse. I think we should just leave it and see if she notices... And then if she does... tell her what happened. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! : Khloe! Oh, I miss you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I miss you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so excited to have my mom and Rob come to visit me in Dallas. Any chance that my family can come out and visit me, it's always good old fun time. &gt;&gt; ROB: Question: the Miami house, what's up with that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Under renovation. &gt;&gt; ROB: Is there any way I can stay there for the weekend? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: There's no furniture, there's nothing in it. Why? &gt;&gt; ROB: Everything's booked, and I'm going there for just a weekend, and it's so packed... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, 'cause it's spring break, that's why. Everyone goes to Miami for spring break. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How would you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was a kid once. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. So I heard that you had a run-in with Todd. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was in a moment of panic; I really was. I was, like, shaking, and I was nervous. He aged really, really well. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew. You're giving me the creeps now. I spent the most time with this guy, and I remember, like, activities I did with him. You had pool parties at the house, downstairs with him. I remember that, but it's weird that I can't remember what he looks like. This whole Todd situation is very uncomfortable for me in general. I was around four, and I, of course, at four, don't know that Todd is not supposed to be around. How'd you guys leave? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, basically he said, "I would really like to see you again, and maybe we can do it so it isn't so awkward. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Uh, Snooka, you know Bruce is gonna kill you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What else did he say? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, even if Bruce says it or doesn't say it, I think he's still thinking, you know, what it did between you and my dad, and he has-- that's only natural... &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's probably thinking if it happened before, it could happen again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But it's only natural; I would think that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want you to worry about me, the guy cheated on me, and I'll never get over it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom was young, we all make mistakes, but why are you still talking about it? Are you going to meet with him again? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I might. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But why do you want to play with fire? Why would you want to see him again? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This isn't somebody that I met and knew for a week, and I can just brush off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel like this chapter in her life should be way closed. I don't know she would even tell anyone if she met up with him. She would just do what she did the last time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't look at it like I'm playing with fire. I'm looking at it like I have a few things I'd like to say to him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Meaning what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got divorced! I left my husband for this guy. I gotta go. Bye, you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Something's weird, 753 00:35:44,646 --> 00:35:47,515 I swear. I think she's gonna go see Todd. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie! I think it, like, dried and stuck up even more. What do we do, like, seriously? 759 00:36:08,203 --> 00:36:11,239 &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know. Kill ourselves? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nothing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, if you're doing nothing, you look very suspicious. I'm not moving till you tell me what's going on. Bad day at school or what? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You dented the car? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, Dad. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Should we just tell him? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Tell me what? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: If you promise you won't get pissed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? I won't. Oh, my God, what did you do? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is, like, so expensive. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Kylie spilled spaghetti. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it's Kylie. It's Kylie's fault? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall kicked me, and I spilled some sauce. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We tried to vacuum it with this, like, big machine to clean up the stain. And when we did it, it lifted the carpet. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, that's not good. Did you tell Mom? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm! No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, you got to tell Mom. You got to come clean. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I mean, if you want to take the blame... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, you could take the blame, be the good dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'd rather have you take the heat on this one. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's so scary, though. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, but her bark is usually worse than her bite. You know, she's back tomorrow. Be honest, tell her what happened, take the wrath, move on. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't think we're gonna live another day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Being back from Dallas, I actually thought by this time I'd have a little more clarity on what my decision would be about seeing Todd. I talked to Kim, I talked to Khloe, and thought they could help me decide. But I'm the only one who actually knows what's inside my heart, and my heart's still 795 00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:57,545 telling me that I need to see him. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, just gonna go, uh, run some errands. &gt;&gt; KIM: In that jacket? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Does it look cute? Like, if you saw me, would you go, "She looks cute"? &gt;&gt; KIM: I would be, like, "Oh yeah, she looks cute leaving the Oscars." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not quite. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hello, guys. Little Wayne wears that to the Laker games. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, I got to go. This has been really fun, but you guys are annoying. Bye! &gt;&gt; ROB: Bye, Mom! &gt;&gt; KIM: She is so weird. Like, you know, Mom was saying that she wanted to go see her ex-boyfriend Todd... &gt;&gt; ROB: No way, dude. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and have, like, a talk with him. I just really hope that Mom, like, learned her lesson the first time and isn't meeting up with Todd. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why would she do that? She messes up at this age, she's done because why would you want to start over? 817 00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:15,189 &gt;&gt; KIM: Right? Who would want to? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. Okay, okay, okay, that's enough, that's enough. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: One more, one more. Hit one more. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, catch. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, no! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have to go. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Catch! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop throwing food! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mom, Kylie has something to tell you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We... your carpet in the living room... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: There's a little tear in it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's a tear? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, you want to show me where it is? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Come on, Kylie. Let's go. Move it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She's gonna kill us. We're screwed, basically. Like, I don't know what else to say. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's it? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What do you mean, "That's it"? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, that's it! Kylie, it's... Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a huge rip in your rug. This is, like, a expensive rug. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it's not the end of the world. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait. you're seriously not mad? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not a big deal. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm in shock. I don't know what has gotten into my mom, but I feel like I just got away with murder. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So you guys will call Kyle Bunting. He'll fix it. He made the rug and he'll take care of it. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, call Fisher, and he'll sew it up like he sewed up your vagina, Mom. Do that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give me a kiss. I gotta go. Bye. Thanks, you guys, for telling me. That's very mature of you. Give me a kiss. Okay, I have to go, all right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. So you're not, like, mad? You would have flipped out back in the day. If that were me or Kourtney did something like that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kyle will fix it. It's not the end of the world, and I gotta go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm shocked. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Me, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I thought she was gonna go nuts. &gt;&gt; KIM: Something's weird. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe this is the new Kris. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What a relief. &gt;&gt; KIM: I swear, I think she's gonna see Todd. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now call the company, get it fixed. &gt;&gt; ROB: Let's go follow her then. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you guys going? &gt;&gt; ROB: We're going house hunting. &gt;&gt; KIM: House hunting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Without me? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, you're in the next round, remember? &gt;&gt; KIM: Bye. My mom can say that running into Todd was not a big deal, but because she didn't have closure in this relationship, I know that she just can't make up her mind 872 00:41:27,088 --> 00:41:31,092 about going to meet with Todd. Where do you think she's going? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hurry, hurry, go. &gt;&gt; ROB: She's really getting on my nerves. &gt;&gt; KIM: We've got to make this light. She's probably so in her own world, she has no idea what kind of car you drive. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know, but she would normally would freak the out if we spilled something on her carpet. &gt;&gt; KIM: Not only spilled, but ripped her carpet. "Oh, it's okay. Don't worry. I gotta go." &gt;&gt; ROB: Where is she going? though. Honestly. &gt;&gt; KIM: She was just gonna run errands, and then she was dressed up so nicely. &gt;&gt; ROB: We're just gonna follow her and see what she's doing all day? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's called playing paparazzi. &gt;&gt; ROB: My mom and Bruce have been married for 20 years, so this whole, like, thing that Kim's trying to say she's meeting her ex-boyfriend just sounds so bizarre. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is she getting on the freeway right here? 892 00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:38,259 Hurry... We can't lose her. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom is driving crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; TODD: How are you? 896 00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:49,771 &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm good. How are you? &gt;&gt; TODD: Good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait a minute. That's not her, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: She stayed on the freeway. This isn't her car. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think that is her. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's not her license plate. You totally just followed a different car off the freeway, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: You were with me following. You said, "Get off the freeway. 906 00:43:08,823 --> 00:43:12,393 Follow that car. Change lanes." &gt;&gt; KIM: We just lost her. Next on Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KRIS: The Dominican Republic. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You are our sacrifice! Get her! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna kick your asses! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not gonna take advice from you, who's going and meeting with people from your past. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who are you meeting from your past?
