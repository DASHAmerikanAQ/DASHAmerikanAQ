- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you? &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: Good. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm meeting with Babyface, and we're gonna discuss our new music management company. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: With my expertise and your expertise, we can give them a place where they can be heard. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can be the judges. You can be Simon and I'll be Paula. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: Oh... ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get over there, girls. We're warming you up. &gt;&gt; LIZ: Ooh, ah... &gt;&gt; LISA: Yeah, you better. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, is this good? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Put them on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I use it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Up there, come on, Liz! &gt;&gt; LIZ: Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, yes! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There goes another one, right by you, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! &gt;&gt; LISA: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, honey, I got game you just don't know I ever had. O-oh, yeah, oh, here we go, here we go! Here we go again! One of my best friends, Lisa Miles, has invited me and Liz to come over and play tennis. Tennis was always such a huge part of my life, and I haven't played in so long, and I'm so excited to be out on the court. &gt;&gt; LISA: Get it, Lizzie. 28 00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,424 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! That was my ball! You're like, such a... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, go get that one! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay! Hey, it's my side! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, then, stop making those noises. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What was that? 36 00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,612 ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, honey, that was fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, it was fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, we used to play a lot of tennis back in the day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I had a tennis court most of my adult life. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And that's just what we did with our spare time, all we did was play tennis on the weekend. Kids had tennis lessons after school, and... Our whole life just revolved around our tennis court. When I was married to Robert Kardashian, one of the things that we did, every single weekend, was play tennis. &gt;&gt; ROBERT: Kourtney, perfect. Ooh, good one, Kim. First tennis lesson. Good stroke. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And it brings back so many amazing memories to be able to get back on the court and kind of relive those old days. Tennis courts come in pretty handy, by the way. We could take that whole side of the house, and put a tennis court there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm? 56 00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,642 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Nothing. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Starting to feel it 59 00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:37,357 rolling on, here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott Pruett, who's one of the great road racers of all time, he invited us out to drive the car hard, and also spend some time with, uh, my son Brandon. Having as many kids as I have, it's kind of tough to spend good quality time with, uh, every one of them, because you've only got so much time in the day, but... I really enjoy my time I spend, uh, with my kids. When was the last time you saw Mr. Pruett? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I mean, it's been a long time. &gt;&gt; PRUETT: Been a long time. Probably in the early '90s. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; PRUETT: Late '80s, early '90s. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Late '80s, early '90s. &gt;&gt; PRUETT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you can believe it, he's still doing this? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I would be, too. &gt;&gt; PRUETT: Oh, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You would be too? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Uh, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If you had the talent? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yep. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; PRUETT: That's what happens. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. It's been fun to watch Brandon grow up. He's been through a lot in his life. He's a great kid who's very talented in so many different areas that, uh, I just love spending time with him. &gt;&gt; PRUETT: All right, you ready to jump in? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah. It's all good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He can handle it! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's got four wheels. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's got four wheels. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I don't know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's the attitude. That's the Jenner attitude, I 90 00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,854 like that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, we're doing 140 mile an hour average around the racetrack, uh, fun cars... It just doesn't get any better than this. How was it? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's great. It's awesome. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, isn't it awesome? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, it's awesome. &gt;&gt; PRUETT: He's ready to go racing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know! I know. He's better than you are! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: This kind of a store makes you want to come in here and buy, like, all new stuff. &gt;&gt; KIM: What's, like, your best racket? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We want to look like we know what we're doing, so we want, like, the best equipment. I love tennis gear. And now that we have all the stuff, I'm so excited to get the whole family back on the tennis court. I think we need a can of balls, 'cause you always have to have fresh balls. Ooh... that's like, yes! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm glad that your memory of balls is coming back to you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, any time there's balls involved, it's my kind of game. Woo! &gt;&gt; KIM: That's what I say. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Two hands, two hands. No, no, with two hands. No, no. Two hands, like this, and go, "Whoosh!" Okay? &gt;&gt; MASON: It's funny. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's funny? No, it's fun. Look... whoosh! We should have a family tennis tournament like every Sunday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't play while I'm pregnant. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hi, Grandma! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys, I am so pumped that we're playing tennis again. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hi, Grandma! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can all play. We can take turns. We can have, like, a round-robin tournament. You know? &gt;&gt; KIM: Across the street... ow! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: That hurts. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, you're soft-headed. &gt;&gt; KIM: You ready? I really suck at serving. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's up with the grunting? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you okay, Mom, with this grunting? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You sound like a freak. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everybody grunts when they play tennis. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it me, or is my mom making these loud, crazy grunt noises when she hits the ball? &gt;&gt; MASON: Whoa! Grandma's funny. &gt;&gt; KIM: Grandma's funny? Watch Grandma. When the ball comes, we go, "Uh!" Okay? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, what do we do? &gt;&gt; MASON: It's hot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Robert, my long-lost brother! &gt;&gt; MASON: Whoa. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want to hear Mom have sex? No, it's live. Here, listen, hold on. &gt;&gt; ROB: What is this? Are you kidding me right now? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, seriously, you don't hear yourself? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? What am I doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that the kind of noise you make when balls are flying at your face? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just breathing, what do you mean? &gt;&gt; KIM: Did we hit Grandma? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have to use the bathroom, you guys. I'll be right back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think it's pretty amazing, Mom's sounds. We need to, like, have a family tennis match so everyone can join in on the fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am, like, so embarrassed. She is so loud. &gt;&gt; MASON: One, Mommy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I want to, like, record her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, don't be embarrassed, it's amazing. We need to have everyone hear this amazing-ness. 169 00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:11,264 ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was the, um, racetrack? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm opening this present I bought for you, because you won't open it for yourself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What else is new? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I won't buy you any more... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What did you get me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...because you don't care. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you mean, I don't care? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got you these board shorts for Brandon's birthday in Hawaii. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you like it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Absolutely. Speaking of Brandon, uh, he did great in the car today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He did? Did he have fun? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. No, Brandon's just a natural at that stuff. He was telling me about his music and stuff, and, uh, that's really... &gt;&gt; KRIS: How's the new song? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: New songs are great. I mean, all the new stuff. I mean, they've been doing this for a while, and... I mean, they're really good. Brandon has been into music all his life. He writes, he produces, he sings. And with Leah, the two of them together are just absolutely phenomenal. And they haven't had a chance to have the big break. And, you know, as a parent, I want to do everything I can to see that happen. You know, you've got this little music company thing going, whatever you're calling it. I don't even know what you're doing with Babyface. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Music management. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, I'm all for that, but, uh... you know, wouldn't you start with somebody, like, right in your family? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like Brandon and Leah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Of course. I mean, they're the only ones with any talent in the family. Kris is starting a new "music management" company with Babyface. There's no reason why we can't use them, you know, in Kris's little marketing machine. And I really feel like it could really give the two of them that jump-start, so people see their music, understand what they're doing. I mean, it's perfect. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think that they're great, but sometimes to mix business and family might not be the perfect solution for that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hold it, hold it. Our whole family on this side is a business. &gt;&gt; KRIS: On this side. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you kidding? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's called my job. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But to be honest with you, on the Jenner side, my side, it's like... nothing. I mean, not even the time of day. I'm really disappointed in Kris. I've done so much for my step-kids throughout the years in helping them get their start. You know, here it is, my side of the family, she's not just all gung ho. She's actually kind of hesitant. So, for me, it honestly hurts me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you want me to do? I work 24/7. You just gave me a whole intervention on I spread myself too thin. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, only too thin with outside stuff. This is inside the family, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I represent all of my kids, but if I took on Brandon and Leah, it would be so much pressure, and it would kill me if I made a decision and it was the wrong one. And I don't think Bruce really understands that kind of pressure. I admire their talent. I have respect for that. I think that they're great. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, then what's the problem? &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you heard her when she plays? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What does it sound like? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it. You're making this miserable. you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kris is excited about having the opportunity to talk with you about management. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I don't know if I would want, like, a stepmom/manager for me, you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brandon, you got to trust me on this. Just take the meeting. 245 00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,747 &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I just don't know, honestly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, honey, let's set up a meeting. I'll talk to Brandon. We'll set up a meeting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're asking me to get involved in something that I don't know if they even want me involved. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It has to be explored. We got to look at it. I really feel if we can bring Brandon and Leah in with their music and their talent, there's no reason why we can't use them, you know, in Kris's little marketing machine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I just want you to understand that, I mean, I love Brandon. I love them together, and I think they're talented. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They've got a new video they just put out online. You got to watch it, see their stuff. I mean, I go to their stuff all the time. Nobody else in the family ever shows up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, can I listen to it in the morning? 263 00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:03,163 I'm absolutely exhausted. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, hi, dolls. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi. You look cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, thanks. Sears. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I like it. &gt;&gt; KIM: You do? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I want it. &gt;&gt; KIM: It might be too short for you, but I'll get you one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are we having a powwow? &gt;&gt; KIM: We're just hanging. Quick question for you. Do you and Mom, like, not get it on or something? 'Cause she really... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you talking about? That's kind of inappropriate to pick up, or to talk about. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're all adults here. Have you heard her when she plays? She sure does express herself on the tennis court. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What does it sound like? &gt;&gt; KIM: She's like, hits the ball and she's like... Like, she has, like, a different noise for, like, every one that she... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I really want to see Mom play tennis. &gt;&gt; KIM: You will hear her soon enough. I'm setting up a family tennis match for all of us. The noise my mom makes, it sounds ridiculous, and I cannot wait for everyone to come and play tennis to hear how embarrassing my mom is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She doesn't make that 290 00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,733 much noise in the bedroom, I guarantee you. Hey, hon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you watch the video? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what, I have not had two seconds to watch that video, but I will, I promise. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's been all morning, and you haven't watched it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just trying to get everybody's schedules together, so don't put any more pressure on me; I'm just trying... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, all you have to do is look at it. Kris now is kind of lukewarm about this whole thing, and all she has to do is listen to the music. I'm very frustrated with her right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you even ask Brandon if it's something that he would want me to be involved in? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why wouldn't he? This is family. I mean, we stick together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you up his ass in his business like this? Let Brandon make his own decisions. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 'Cause I want him to succeed; I want him to do well. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want him to do well, too, but it's not that I have the best track record, you know, or history with his mom. And I don't want his mom coming after me because I made bad decisions for her son. So, now that we're just at a really good place, I don't want to screw that up. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Watch the video. Watch the video. Tell me what you think. Take your time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get it, Kendall. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, Mason. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hi, Mase. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so glad that the whole family is here to witness my mom's grunting. So, I just want to know if I'm crazy. Like, am I the only one that is tortured by this noise? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here we go. 324 00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,001 Kendall, this is for you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ooh, good one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's wrong with you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you have a hernia? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm fine. &gt;&gt; MASON: What's that noise? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa. Sounds like she's gonna drop trou in her pants. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I'm gonna be Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Very funny. 334 00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,763 &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, it's more like... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not funny, you guys. Come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mase, can you go... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, no, do this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, Kim's serving. Go to the other side. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't care who's serving. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop it; you're making this miserable for me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, we just want to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kiss my ass. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know what, I'm done. I wanted to get back into tennis to have some fun, and it kind of reminded me of the old days. But now that my kids have ruined it for me, um, forget it. I was having a really good time. I was enjoying myself. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I bet you were. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I found something that we could do as a family. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't know I was coming over for a gangbang the way you were moaning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You what, Scott, you. Yeah, like, random. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi, good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm in this important meeting with Babyface, and he comes barging in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop, ow! Stop it. Sometimes I do wish that things could be back to how they were in the beginning of our relationship. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I'm a romancer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you're not. 362 00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:39,172 You have no romance in your body. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, you just, like, stormed out of the place. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's just rude. They treat me like crap. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, they're just kidding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, they're not kidding. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're fun to pick on because they get such a reaction out of you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I was actually really excited about playing tennis again, and it brought back a lot of really great memories. Like, it made it sour now for me. This was supposed to be a really fun day, but my kids just wanted to make fun of me. When everyone else is laughing and having fun, and you feel like you're, you know, the joke. I don't want to be the joke. I don't want to play tennis anymore. I'm done. I'm just done. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just cleaning up. Trying to get everything neat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's a first. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not a first, doll, it's a second. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was thinking of taking a bath. Do you feel like running me one? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, like a bubble bath? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I could do that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Scott and I definitely don't have that much time together between work and Mason and getting ready for this second baby. This is nice of you. So when an opportunity comes up where we could spend some romantic time together, I am all about it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are we going butt-naked or are we gonna wear, like, a bathing suit? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is so romantic. Hurting my ankles. Stop! Ow! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey! I'm double- clutching into second, baby! You know what? I want to do something even more special. I'd like to pour salsa all over this foot and eat piece by piece... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop! Ow! Stop it! Ow! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ah! You want a Smurf bite? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. That is so annoying. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, come back here if you know what's good for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I actually wanted to take a bath with you... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and, you know, be romantic... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, me, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and have a nice time, but you're so annoying. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How am I annoying? I'm trying to do fun stuff with you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you not? How are you not? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Stop that. I'm trying to help you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that your little high school way? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: High school way? No. This is my high school way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Turn around and let me show you my &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew! That's disgusting! I know that relationships change over time, but sometimes I do wish that things could be back to how they were in the beginning of our relationship when we were always kissing and, you know, obsessed with each other. Ow! Like, that is not romantic. Pinching someone on their leg is annoying. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I tried to get a piece of lint off of your leg. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, but that's annoying. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I'm a romancer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you're not. You have no romance in your body. 426 00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,601 I'm gonna go take a bath. Stop. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Mother? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom? Well, I have a present for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; KIM: I know that we've been making fun of you. So maybe a little something that will get you to continue to play. So, I think we were being a little harsh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh, you think? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just a little. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? Oh, my... &gt;&gt; KIM: Is that not so crazy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... my... God. Kimmy, this is amazing. What is this? &gt;&gt; KIM: Those are some balls. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Chanel tennis balls? Really, Kim? Love. Thank you. I love this. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're welcome. So just promise you'll play. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I will. I love you, Kimmy. I discovered that I like tennis because it makes me feel good. And it's fun to be with my friends and my family and do something a little bit different. And even if my kids are gonna make fun of me, that will never be enough to bring me down. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love you, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get ready. Start practicing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know Kris is busy, but to spend five minutes to watch a video is not really asking too much, is it? You know, I really feel like I gotta break into her meeting and make Babyface see this video. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I had dinner the other night with Lance Bass. He wants to take a member out of each famous boy band and find five members and create their own boy band. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: That's actually cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then, not only do you end up with a winner, you end up with five new boy band groups. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: That could be hurtful, but, um... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. What are you doing, honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kenny. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: How you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good to see you. Aren't you happy to see me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, yeah, I'm kind of in a meeting with Kenny, though. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I won't take much of your time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, what are you doing? Why is your computer here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I guess we're talking music. Kenny's here, huh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Has Bruce just lost his mind? I'm in this important meeting with Babyface, and he comes 473 00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,681 barging in to my office with no warning? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: People have this kind of... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who? Who? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...affection and passion and romance-- people. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love Kourtney, but right now, she's definitely delusional. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll sit here Titanic and wish that I had some romance in my life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you joking? 482 00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,602 They're actors! We're not in a movie! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kenny. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: How you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good to see you. Aren't you happy to see me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, yeah. I'm kind of in a meeting with Kenny, though. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I won't take much of your time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, what are you doing? Why is your computer here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I guess we're talking music. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, we're trying to discuss what our, you know, new relationship is and our business and what the next thing is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Has she ever mentioned that I have, like, talent in my family? &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brandon produces, writes, does everything. Leah, obviously, coproduces with him. They're just, you know, kind of going out on their own. So me, as a great father, I want to help. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, why's your computer here? We're kind of in a meeting. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I just wanted to show him their latest video. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm in the middle of my meeting with Babyface, and Bruce comes barging in to pitch Brandon for the 300th time. I should be really mad right now. I got to hand it to him, he's sort of taking a page out of my book. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It won't take long. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How did you know Kenny was here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got ways, baby. This is kind of a happy song. But it gives you an idea. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: ♫ So many reasons for you to be smiling ♫ But we should be here right now ♫ Life happens when you're waiting for the bus ♫ Life happens while the day's collecting dust Don't be giving it all away. ♫ &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: Who shot the video? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh, they own the video. They did it themselves. They just put it on YouTube. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: Really nice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm actually really enjoying this music. And Kenny likes it, too. I still feel a little uncomfortable saying yes to this whole management idea. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: As you know, in this business, you just need that break. And I'm thinking we got this marketing machine that's sitting here, you know? And, you know, with the right people... &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: Yeah. No, it's nice. It feels good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: I'd be interested in hearing him sing as well. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I really didn't mean to intrude. Love you to death. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm glad you came by. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a happy song. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I tell you what. I would love to have Kenny hear him in person. And you see if Brandon would be cool with me, you know, and Kenny helping him out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I knew that all they had to do was listen to the music, the two of them. They're so talented, so good, that everybody's gonna jump on board. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You check with Brandon, and Brandon... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've seized the opportunity. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, well, that's, that's a good boy. Talk to Brandon, all right? Okay. You want to take the whole plate? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm fine. Thank you. All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, all right, so we'll talk. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, love you, too. Isn't he delightful? &gt;&gt; BABYFACE: Yeah, he's always 546 00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,727 great. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I think because in my life there's not tons of romance, it's fun to watch these overly romantic movies. You know, that's how I get my little romance kick. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hi, buddy. Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm watching Titanic. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where, upstairs? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. It's so crazy how this kind of romance existed in the world. Everyone needs to be like this. Like, why don't we ever...? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't we have the chemistry that Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet had Titanic? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'll tell you one reason: 'cause we're not in a movie! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want to come watch the movie with me and cry? I'll share my tissue with you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're upstairs thinking that I'm gonna be Leo DiCaprio in five minutes, you're sorely mistaken. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're so romantic. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How the hell are we? I love you, but this is a movie. You want to see romance? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Check under these drawers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right, that's enough. I've had enough of you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I love you, but come on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: People have this kind of affection and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Who? Who? Who? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: People. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You remember the first time we had sex? I mean, you know, juices were flowing,were flying. That was a long time ago. I love Kourtney, but right now she's definitely delusional. Yes, the movie's based upon a true story, but they're recreating something so people can have enjoyment and entertainment. Just being a realist. There's no way people really act like that. Kourtney's expectations are just so out of whack with real life. If you want, I'll go downstairs, I'll turn the heat on in the Rolls, I'll turn you over, and I'll throw you some I'll steam that car right up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can you stop talking about it and just leave me. I'll sit here and cry and watch and wish that I had some romance in my life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you joking? They're actors! 588 00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:43,502 I'll put a tuxedo on. I'll romance you, you'll see. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: There you go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right at the green. Put it up there, Brandon. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Oh, really nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Not bad. Easy game. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's easy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I spoke with Kris. She's excited about having the opportunity to talk with you about management. I'm kind of pumped up about this. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: About Kris 'cause... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Managing, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: She started a management company. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Her and Babyface. I think he would be, like, perfect for you guys. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, I think it would be kind of weird having her as our manager, you know? I don't know if I would want, like, a step-mom/manager for me, you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honestly, you should go meet with her. It's all being in the right place, being around the right people. I think she could do a great job. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: She's obviously very talented. She's done a lot for all of you guys. I just don't know if-if it would be a good fit for us. I just, I just don't know, honestly. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is ridiculous. It's so tough just to get Kris on board. Now, all of a sudden, Brandon's getting cold feet. I mean, we have such a marketing machine here. Why wouldn't anybody want to be involved in this thing? Brandon, you got to trust me on this. Listen, hey, I'm all in. I-I just want to... I just want to see you guys, you know, on the big stage. That's all I'm saying. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Listen, Dad... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just take the meeting. Take it seriously. Don't, you know, don't worry. It's gonna be all right. I, you know, I'm all for this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My girlfriend's obsessed with Ryan Gosling The Notebook. So, I'm trying to portray that 624 00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:25,037 for her. Boom. You like what you see? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce has been putting a lot of pressure on me to meet with Brandon. He's really excited about maybe seeing where we can go with it. 630 00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,886 &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I-I think that it would be difficult. &gt;&gt; JIMMY COCO: I have to mix up some color for you really quick. Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Even though I think Kourtney is completely delusional, I still want to go out of my way to show her that we can have that romance that people have in the movies. The Notebook, the actor, Ryan Gosling. I mean, he's got all these things. He's a professional romantic, got the abs, got it all. So, I figure, okay, that's the first step to getting there. You can do, like, some kind of airbrushing stuff. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I want to get that look going, because my girlfriend's obsessed with Ryan The Notebook. So, I'm trying to portray that for her. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Awesome. So, that's what you're wearing. Strappy sandals. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: These stick to your foot? By the way, this should be the new sneaker. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Okay, here we go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They're unbelievable. Look at these! Who needs a shoe? These are unbelievable. I'll wear atuxedo with these. &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Okay, so step into my office. We have a gold shimmer or a silver shimmer. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A golden shower? &gt;&gt; JIMMY: Shimmer. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I didn't even realize that they could spray these abs on as easy as they can. I don't know if it's gonna knock Kourtney's socks off, but it should. I can work with this. I feel like you Coco'd the out of me. That's it. That's the money shot right there. One of those. Boom, how are you, fellas? I realize that the main is not only good-looking and in good shape, he also is a professional handyman. And if by fixing some shutters and blinds around the house is gonna get her panties wet, so be it. I'll try it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where have you been? I wrote you 98 times on text message. You like what you see? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why are you hammering something? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've been waiting for you for so long to get back here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, why do we even need something done out here? I would love if you literally knew how to do some, like, chores. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just knocked those nails back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What nails? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They were sticking out. I can't quit you. Don't you get it? This is what you wanted. I'm here. I'm working on the house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is not what I want. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on, this isn't romance? What more can I do? You watch these movies. You tell me they're real. So, I'm putting them to life. I mean, I feel like all you want is something that I'm not, and I don't know what else to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want you to just be, like, attentive, and even, like, yesterday when we went to lunch, literally the whole time you were on your cell phone. I don't think you spoke to us one time. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was working. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't care. So don't join us. Scott just doesn't get it. He's making fun of something that I find important. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I'm gonna put my tools away. Unless you wanted a little of that. Maybe a little of this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I once found Scott to be charming, but while I'm pregnant, I don't at all. I'm all good. 698 00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,366 Hey, stop. I don't like that thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I think that Brandon and Leah are really talented. Bruce has been putting a lot of pressure on me to meet with Brandon, so today's the day I'm gonna meet with him at my office. Hey, Brandon. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How's it going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love your hair. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel a little nervous about talking to Brandon by myself, so I'm bringing Kim along to kind of break the ice. So, I wanted to meet with you today because your dad has been talking to me a lot about you over and over. Your dad showed Kenny and I the video. Loves it. I loved it. It was really, really good. You guys are really talented. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, Kenny, he's really excited about, like, getting together with the two of you and maybe seeing where we can go with it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I-I think that it would be difficult... to have you being my step-mom and my manager. I don't know if that makes a ton of sense. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, are you claiming that you made this nice, cold, hard, sticky pasta? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on, man. What else can I do? Nothing I do works. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's go outside and talk. Brandon and I want to have a little chat with you, and you might need some fresh air. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, what's going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kenny and I are really excited about seeing where we can go with it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I-I think that it would be difficult to have you being my step-mom and my manager. I don't know if that makes a ton of sense. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's kind of music to my ears. I thought I was the only one that was feeling like this. I mean, it's kind of a relief, because I felt like the situation can go south really fast and ruin our relationship. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yeah, absolutely. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Which has always been kind of just chill. I don't want to disappoint anybody. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I completely agree. I think it would be more difficult for you and I to... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: ...get into a management situation. You know, I feel the same way as you do. I totally understand. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Brandon's right. Maybe doing business together might really complicate our relationship. Well, we've got to break it to him, and I think he feels like I truly don't want to help you, when in fact, I would do anything for you that you asked me to do. Or that you wanted me to do. If you could come over and help me explain it to him so he understands it, so I'm not this bad guy. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So will you help me do that? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: 100%, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'm here to help. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. I love you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I love you, too. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruiser. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you coming in? What the hell are we doing here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean, what are we doing here? We're going to get out shave. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, yeah. Well, I don't need one. I already shaved, cleaned up. What the hell do you go to a place to shave for? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So I'm meeting Bruce today at The Shave, and I just really needed some time out of my house. He's dealt with pregnant women before. I know he probably would know what I'm going through. And maybe he'd help me out a bit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So how's everything on the home front? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Lately, Kourtney has just been... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Driving you crazy? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, different than most. Lately, she's had these ridiculously high expectations for romance. And she takes everything from these movies she watches and thinks that they're real. It's so unrealistic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott, now that you're gonna have a little girl, this is gonna be your life. Little girls for the guy are like the best thing that's ever happened. They want to hold your hand, they want to do everything. Daddy's little girl. And then they hit about 12. It's scary as hell. I remember with Kourtney one time I went downstairs, and I said, "Good morning, Kourtney." And she looks at me and goes, when you talk to me that way!" You just go through hell until they go off to college. And just about that time, your wife hits menopause. You know, you're in bed and you got four sets of covers on you 'cause she's got the air conditioner going so damn bad that she's going, "Oh, my God, it's sohot in here." This is what you have to look forward to. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me just stop you there and say for a motivational speaker, you really make life sound like &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was just hoping I was gonna get a little advice, but you've really made me just want to go to K-Mart and get a gun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just be understanding. Think ahead of her. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm all those things already. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know, but you got to be, like, thinking ahead of her, what her needs are gonna be. Women love that stuff, don't they? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, so I bet in an hour from now, she's gonna want, like, a pickle and a ginger ale. I'm asking Bruce for some advice on what I should and shouldn't do, and the truth is I just need to come up with something fast and make her happy because a happy wife's a happy life. Wow, you look, like, glowing. It almost looks like you're pregnant. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who knows? I could be. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How's it going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on in. It's going good. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: How are you? Good. Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good to see you. You look nice. I think your dad's in here. He'll be surprised to see you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Okay, cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm having Brandon come over here in the hopes that I can convince Bruce that Brandon and I are not gonna work together. Hey, honey, look who's here. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brandoni! You didn't tell me he was gonna come. Why didn't you tell me he was coming over? &gt;&gt; KRIS: He wanted to surprise you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Surprise me? I'm surprised. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Nothing beats a good surprise. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Let's go outside and talk. Brandon and I want to have a little chat with you, and you might need some fresh air. I don't know exactly how Bruce is gonna react, but he needs to understand that we all love him and it has nothing to do with Bruce. It's just what's best for the family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So what's going on? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, Brandon and I had a meeting, and we talked a little bit about, you know, your idea, and I think that we're both on exactly the same page in that we both think the idea really sucks. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sucks? Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Sucks. 831 00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:27,138 &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, we both have reservations. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Brandon and I talked a little bit about, you know, your idea, and I think that we're both on exactly the same page, in that we both think the idea really sucks. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Well, we both have reservations about getting involved on a business level, because we have a good dynamic as family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got a good dynamics as a family here, but we do a lot of business. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No, I know, but it's a different dynamic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's different. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I just think that it makes more sense to keep our relationship as is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I also want you to know it's not that I don't want to do something, it's that I don't want to let Brandon down and he doesn't want to let me down. And we both agreed that it's the right thing for our family dynamic. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I appreciate your help, but what means more to me, honestly, is how proud you are of us, and how you do come out to shows and how she was telling me that you play the video for people when they come over, and that you're proud to show them that video. And that means more to me than anything else. And that's, that's huge. 854 00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,908 And that's all I really, absolutely all I ask. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All I want is for you guys to get what you guys deserve. I certainly live with your decision. Not a problem at all. You know, throughout the years, we have been through a lot as a blended family, and I don't want any of those things that went on in the past to affect their future, so maybe it is a little bit too close, but as a parent, I'm still gonna support him and do everything I can to help Brandon and Leah out. We're here to help. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Of course. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Any time you need us, we're there for you, Brandon. Any time. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Absolutely. I really appreciate that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All you have to do is ask, honey. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, then I'll manage you. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Now we're talking. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Perfect. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Yes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You go for it, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why are you guys laughing?! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Now we're talking. I love it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, yeah! See? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I like that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We don't need you, honey. I'll do it. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: There you go. 878 00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,564 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, that... Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh. Seriously? For me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously? I'm gonna go grab Mason. Okay, so Mason's gonna sleep over. You have the night to yourself. Call me. Let me know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank you. Hopefully, some real magic happens. &gt;&gt; MASON: Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: Say, "Good luck." &gt;&gt; MASON: Bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Love you, Mase. &gt;&gt; MASON: Bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, I feel like I've really been losing this battle of trying to get Kourtney to realize that I am romantic. I'd really hoped to just sweep her off her feet with this last gesture. And if this doesn't work, I 893 00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:16,140 think I'm hanging up the old tool belt, no pun intended. Yo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why are you all dressed up? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's a big night in front of us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is the big night? I planned a romantic dinner for us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Flowers? Ooh, candles. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just wanted to have a little something, you know, kind of nice for us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you want a drink? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll have a water. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sparkling or flat? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sparkling. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This looks good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It should be. You've been watching all these romance movies, and the truth is I feel like, you know, we do have to spice up our relationship a little bit, and, you know, try to be romantic from time to time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can I get that water? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Coming right up, Buford. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cheers. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, are you claiming that you made this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not claiming anything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cold. Nice, cold, hard, sticky pasta. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on, man. I'm trying. What else can I do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's great. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Obviously, I can't cook. I tried that. I even looked at a Martha Stewart cookbook. That was taking too long. Nothing I do works. I just want you to be happy, that's all. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There is something really romantic about how hard you've been trying. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, thanks. I mean, I really have been trying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know I'm not the easiest person, especially when I'm pregnant and hormonal. Scott definitely does a lot for me that is romantic. I just need to make sure that I appreciate him. You are being very romantic. I'm just very hormonal right now, so I know I'm being hard on you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All I care about is you being happy. I'm so relieved that Kourtney's finally starting to realize that it doesn't take a movie star-type romantic role to make someone happy. It just takes genuine love and care, and I have that. I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I love you more. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bring it in for the real thing, bitch. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Only kidding. Watch my spray tan. I can't quit you! Next time on: Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know my friend Kimmy? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hey, guys! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, it says! This Web site's crazy. &gt;&gt; MAN: You look fantastic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thanks. I left my husband for this guy. &gt;&gt; MAN: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN: Don't let go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, he looked really good. 947 00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:44,021 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you gonna tell Bruce you ran into him?
