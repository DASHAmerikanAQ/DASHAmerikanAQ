- &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is <i>so</i> good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob's missing out. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, where <i>is</i> he? &gt;&gt; KRIS: When was the last time he missed a Thursday night dinner? &gt;&gt; KIM: He always comes home with laundry. He's had <i>no</i> laundry. So weird. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE BIALON: So you need to learn these three things. If it's dark clothes, cold. If it's colors, go cold-warm. Whites get washed in only hot water. They're the only thing that gets washed in hot water. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Okay, go. What did I just tell you? &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh, cold... I don't know. I don't do this &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Okay, listen, listen, listen. &gt;&gt; ROB: So I'm dating Adrienne Bailon and she is, uh, a Cheetah Girl. It started off as the first musical on the Disney channel They sing, dance. Movies. Clothes, video games, you name it. When I first met Adrienne, I was <i>so</i> in love with her... &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Just make them all go in. &gt;&gt; ROB: Let's go. Let's go. I'm trying to find someone who's your best friend and who makes you happy and who you can talk to all the time, and that's Adrienne. This <i>is</i> my first time I've been in love. I'm starting to act as I was before my dad passed away. I definitely feel that my dad brought us together. I tell Adrienne that all the time. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: We're getting ice cream everywhere. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, you're getting it on your face. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Where is it? Fix it. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, you. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Fix it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, I feel like we have to set up an appointment to see you these days &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, where have you been? Were you, um, studying for finals? I haven't seen you in like two weeks. &gt;&gt; ROB: I've been in school and with my... I got a girlfriend now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, you're like... &gt;&gt; ROB: Official. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...exclusive and official? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When did that happen? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm very hesitant to bring Adrienne around my three sisters. My sisters, they tend to get too involved in my relationships. You guys aren't coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert! We are the people that approve or deny. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why are you guys here? You guys just made this <i>so</i> weird. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, you're like... &gt;&gt; ROB: Official. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...exclusive and official. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When did that happen? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you call each other your girlfriend, boyfriend? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you guys in love? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, you're in love? &gt;&gt; ROB: Guys, I got a tattoo to prove it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You did not get a tattoo. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'll show you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert! &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob! It's enormous. &gt;&gt; ROB: No one's gonna see this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You never take your shirt off? All you do is take your shirt off. You walk around in Calvin Kleins and no shirts all the time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're, like, all in shock, like, is this a joke or something? Her full name is tattooed on him, and we are just like, <i>"What</i> are you <i>doing?"</i> &gt;&gt; ROB: You're just jealous 'cause I'm in love. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whatever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does she have one, too? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, since we don't know Adrienne, we decide to get to know her, whether Rob likes it or not. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm gonna go use the restroom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Pass me that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's get Adrienne's number. &gt;&gt; KIM: You don't even know her. You're gonna ruin it with him. Why are you gonna call her? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just want to get to know her. If he's not introducing us, we need to get to know her ourselves. He's not introducing us. Because I don't know Adrienne, I'm just scared that she will hurt him and, like, that would just be devastating to all of us. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, you're crazy. &gt;&gt; All right, we're ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, no, no, you're right here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The wind, you guys-- is this necessary? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Go change. Awful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, that is not cute. &gt;&gt; ROB: I need someone to make me laugh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's Kim? Kim is always late. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of our way. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop, jealous. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Stop! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's enough. &gt;&gt; All right, you guys. &gt;&gt; That's it, we're done. &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim. Why are you eating cake? Kim. My entire family has been eating horribly lately. I need to do something to get them on a healthy track. You've got to stop with the sugar. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? I had no idea. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop with the... &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, relax-- I just had one small bite. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's always one small bite, Kim, and it just turns into about 62 small bites. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So let's call Adrienne right now. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Adrienne? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: This is she. Who's calling? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, it's Kourtney and Khloe, Rob's sisters. We were just calling, um... 'cause we just had lunch with Rob and he told us how you guys are official and we thought that maybe on your way out tonight we could meet for coffee next to our store. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Um, sure. It's okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, perfect, we'll see you later. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye, sugah. My family's constantly getting involved in each other's love lives. My sisters just got involved with me and Scott and we're back together now and things are really good. So now <i>I'm</i> gonna get involved in <i>Rob's</i> love life. &gt;&gt; KIM: How are you? &gt;&gt; KATHY KAYLOR: I'm good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm bringing in my trainer and my nutritionist, Kathy Kaylor, who's gonna teach us how to eat a little bit better. &gt;&gt; KATHY: What are you eating over there? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I-I don't even know. &gt;&gt; KATHY: What is, what is this that you were just eating? No, no. Let me see that. Do you have this stuff? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's like, look what she just ate for breakfast. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Excuse me. Who just took the whole piece out of the cake? &gt;&gt; KIM: Who just made it? &gt;&gt; KATHY: We're gonna clean out all this stuff that you should not be feeding, one, yourself, but let alone your kids! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna throw all this stuff in my refrigerator away? &gt;&gt; KATHY: Yes! Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, I like that stuff. &gt;&gt; KATHY: No, no, no. This is... &gt;&gt; KIM: I love those. &gt;&gt; KATHY: Kim, we are starting. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, I love to make biscuits. &gt;&gt; KRIS: These are done. &gt;&gt; KATHY: Look at this. This is... Okay, honestly. I don't want you to have this. &gt;&gt; KIM: These are just for looks, they're like real glitter eggs that you can eat. &gt;&gt; KATHY: If you're talking about cute little glitter eggs, where are your real eggs? Do you guys eat eggs? &gt;&gt; KIM: We just used them to bake that cake. &gt;&gt; KATHY: What about having your own coop? You've got so much space here. You could have fresh eggs every day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You mean like real chickens? &gt;&gt; KATHY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love that idea. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really a good idea. When Kathy realizes that we're not using, you know, organic eggs... She said to me that the best thing to do for our family would be to get some chickens and have a chicken coop in the backyard, so that every day we could have fresh eggs for our whole family. &gt;&gt; KATHY: This is not dairy, just FYI. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whipped cream? &gt;&gt; KATHY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KATHY: Oh, stop. Okay, but this gets hard and... Stop it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom! Stop! Mom! Stop! &gt;&gt;&gt; KATHY: No, no, no, no, no... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! No... &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to start eating healthy. We're gonna have a new eating plan. Oh, my God, guess what we're gonna do. We're gonna build a chicken coop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you girls talking about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kathy Kaylor was here and took one look at what we had going on in this kitchen and she was, like, mortified. And we need to build a chicken coop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My mom wants to get a chicken coop 'cause one of her Beverly Hills friends has a chicken coop in the backyard of her $20 million house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Chickens are the dirtiest animals alive. They're disgusting. I hate chickens. I won the Olympic games... eating old eggs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've got news for you guys. I'm gonna get some chickens. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just really wanna make sure that Adrienne is like a good girl and that she's not gonna break Rob's heart. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Now that he went and got this whole tattoo, I'm like... Ahh! ♫ Tie the bows... ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We meet Adrienne, and we're a little bit scared, like who's this girl? Did she force my brother to get a tattoo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're really not here to like bombard you or scare you. We just want to get to know you. And you cannot tell Rob, because he would kill us. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I feel bad-- I can't tell... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, but just... we'll tell him later. Just don't tell him tonight. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Adrienne might be great. They might really be in love. We just want to feel her out and we'll see what kind of girl she is. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: You know what's weird for me? Is Rob is actually the first guy that I've ever introduced as my boyfriend to anyone. I didn't see Rob like that at first. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, that's how it was with Scott and I, too. He was four years younger than me also, and I was just like, oh, this little boy-- whatever. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: It's so weird for me to say, "This is my boyfriend... this is Robert, he's my boyfriend." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Like it's a big thing for me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you in love? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Yes. Rob is like, to me, really, really handsome. I think you guys know your brother's a great guy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's amazing. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I feel super, super blessed to have met him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We just want to make sure he doesn't get his heart broken. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I love that boy to death. And it sounds soon... but something inside tells me that I really do believe that Rob is the one. He's great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You cannot tell Rob that we met with you. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I'm not saying a word. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: After sitting and talking with Adrienne, she's actually the sweetest girl. It's a really genuine good relationship. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Bye, babe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Toodle-loo. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Rob. Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is Adrienne, everybody. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Are you Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Adrienne and I are together. I'm in love. So now I'm going to introduce Adrienne to my family and we'll see how that goes. Isn't she more beautiful in person? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, handsome. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you think, girls? Are you surprised? &gt;&gt; ROB: She's even better naked. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Robert! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Robbie! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why would you say that? &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm kidding. Do you know she's a Cheetah Girl? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I just saw the <i>Cheetah Girl 2</i> movie. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: That's embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think Robert, for the first time in his life, has fallen in love. You know, he's so comfortable with her. It's really, really sweet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Let's pick her up. Come on, let's go. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Can you guys...? Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; ROB: Whoa there. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Whoa, the picture. You're losing your girlfriend to your little sisters. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's not a toy. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Kylie reminds me of me. She's going to be an actress, watch. She should come with us for the third movie. &gt;&gt; ROB: She's too old. She's got to get... oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: The third Cheetah Girls movie. I'm stealing your sister... &gt;&gt; ROB: The third one? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: ...and taking her with me to India. &gt;&gt; ROB: What, you're going to India to shoot the third movie? I've only been dating Adrienne for three months, and all of a sudden she is saying how she's going to India and I'm just shocked. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: It takes three months. It takes three months. &gt;&gt; ROB: Three months is a long... that's a long time. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I know. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm with you like every single day. I can't believe that this is happening. I spend every minute with her. And then to go from a minute to like three months is just crazy. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: If I wasn't with you every day, would it be different? Would it change? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I mean, like, yeah, it would be... &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: You want to go home, or...? &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I really want to see you. I'm always texting you like, "Come home, come home, come home." I need to like, be with you all the time. No, stay. Don't go. I don't want this time to come. She just makes me really happy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob Dawg's depressed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause Cheetah Nuts is leaving. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where, did she go back to New York? &gt;&gt; ROB: Cheetah Girl. No, she's going to, uh, India. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you think she's going to cheat on you? &gt;&gt; ROB: She never would. I'm just very insecure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't really think you have anything to worry about. I think that she's... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's really honest. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...you know, seems like she's really an honest girl, and that she would... &gt;&gt; ROB: What thewould you guys know? Seriously, you guys don't know &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When we were at lunch and you went to the bathroom... &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I got her... it fell out of your phone, and we asked her to come have coffee with us so we could get to know her better. &gt;&gt; ROB: Did you guysit up or no? Did she like you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Obviously not, if she's still calling you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, thank you. I don't know what's the deal with my sisters doing these 007 sneaky things to me. But, you know, they ended up liking her, so I guess it made things easier for me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I don't think you have anything to worry about. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wouldn't stress about it &gt;&gt; ROB: Alright &gt;&gt; ROB: Feed her &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Feed me, Seymour &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When my Dad died, so much of my brother disappeared And I really appreciate Adrienne for letting him play and be goofy and just be so genuinely happy It's really sad that this is Adrienne's last dinner She's going to India for three months. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: How far away is... 14 hours from me from New York &gt;&gt; ROB: We got a plan, though. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: But we got a plan. We went and changed our phone plans-- we have a global plan, right, baby? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: These kids live in cyberspace. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: And I have the cologne. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're taking his cologne? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Yes. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm a sucker for love. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When do you...? &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't know I was going to a feed barn. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How cute is this place. &gt;&gt; KIM: My mom decides to drag us all to this barn and get chickens. It's so disgusting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, that little chicken's cute. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'll take all of those. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're so cute. I want all black and white ones with like little red things on the front. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not sitting here. Bye, kook. It smells like a dinosaur's cave. It's disgusting. I'm not touching the chicken. It's gross. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're going to love it at our house. What do you think of all these new chickens? Khloe, she's jerking around. What does that mean? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She wants jerk chicken. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe... Khloe... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Drop it! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe! Khloe! Khloe! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get the chicken &gt;&gt; KIM: Ok, I'm going to corner it. Get it, get it. On that side. Got it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got it, I got it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Will you help us catch the chicken? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim's got it. Help me. Come here. No, no, no. No, no, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Ew! It pooped on me! &gt;&gt; ROB: When is your flight? Like, when are you taking off? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Like, should be heading now. Like right on time. &gt;&gt; ROB: No, stay. Don't go. I don't want this time to come. I don't want this to happen, but, you know, she has to make her flight. I mean, I'm not forgetting about my dad, but she fills that void. So she just makes me really happy. Don't cry. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I love you. I just, I'm gonna miss you. It's not that I think... I'm just really gonna miss you. ♫ So what do we do from here? ♫ &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I love you. ♫ When this damn town Has got us crazy? ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna show you guys what real fresh eggs taste like. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: They reek. They reek. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, these eggs better be good after how those damn chickens smelled. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The best eggs you've ever had in your entire life. Okay, Kylie... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: These better be miracle eggs. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Taste the ones that I... cultivated and hatched. &gt;&gt; KIM: I actually think this tastes a little dirty. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Dirty? It's the freshest, most organic thing you guys can have. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They have, like, a weird scent and taste. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you try a regular egg? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I don't like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I did. Here, nanny. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just wanted you guys to, like, eat something good in your life, like some organic eggs. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get him out of here. The dog will not eat the chicken eggs. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Kourt, I just dropped Adrienne off at the airport. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aw. You should just come over and take your mind off of it. I just want to go to my place and watch <i>Cheetah Girl</i> movies. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's only gonna make you more sad. Rob, you should really just come over. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm sorry. I'm just... I just need, like, to be alone for right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Feel better. &gt;&gt; ROB: Okay. Love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just hung up with Rob... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and I really think we need to do something. I've, like, never seen him this depressed. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's so sad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, I just thought of what we can do. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's too cold for the chickens to be outside. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Chickens are fine. They sit together. They'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, why don't we bring 'em inside? We'll put 'em in Mom's bathtub. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel bad for the chickens, so I decide to go with Kylie and put the chickens inside. Since my mom loves chickens so much, I wanted to put them in her bathtub. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Khloe, can you take this? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, put 'em in there. I got to wash my hands. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I can't 'cause you made me hug him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Throw it. Who did not help you in this? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Exactly. If there are any traces of my DNA in this room... &gt;&gt; ROB: It was really hard for me to get up and take Adrienne to the airport. I'm not gonna be able to, like, see Adrienne, kiss Adrienne. It's just a miserable feeling. ♫ My poor heart My poor heart... ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! Whose idea? Kylie, was it your idea? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That wasn't my fault. That was all Khloe's fault. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have got to be kidding me. Hey, guys, what are you doing in here? You make a mess on me, buddy, and you'll be dinner. What's the deal with the chickens in the bathtub? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie did it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, it was... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you're ratting on her. Whose idea? Kylie, was it your idea? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That wasn't my fault! That was all Khloe's fault! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are the rest of the chickens? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh...! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Honestly, that is the most digesting thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Pick it. Pick it up. Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Get it out of my house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I'm never eating a chicken... &gt;&gt; KIM: It stinks! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I knew this chicken thing was a bad idea right from the beginning. They are going back to the farm. You want eggs? What'd you get? Poopy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's not gonna be any chickens. That was not a great idea that I brought the chickens home. You can't win 'em all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Roberto! Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rob. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sit down. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We know you're having a rough day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We got you this. &gt;&gt; ROB: You know, you guys shouldn't have. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We work really hard to support our brother. &gt;&gt; ROB: Thank you so much. What am I gonna do with a video camera? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Open this and you'll find out. &gt;&gt; ROB: You guys are too much. What is this mumbo-jumbo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's your itinerary to go to India! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Air India! &gt;&gt; ROB: My sisters are so cool. I love 'em to death. They're the best sisters in the world. India's really expensive, A: and B: I'm gonna see Adrienne, who I love, so I'm gonna be very happy, it'll cheer me up. Come here. Give papa a hug. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw... <i>Papi chulo. Papi...</i> &gt;&gt; ROB: That's what she calls me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Girls? I got dinner. I picked up dinner on my way home. Got fried chicken, girls. You, eat it for getting that chicken. Bringing that chicken in my house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't do anything. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bringing that chicken in my house and making its poop on the floor, helping Kylie with it. You gotta eat this chicken. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was Kendall! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Eat it! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall did that! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Eat the chicken! &gt;&gt; KRIS: The dog's gonna eat it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, that's so mean. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She doesn't eat people food. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's gonna make a run for it. &gt;&gt; Next on <i>Keeping Up</i> <i>With The Kardashians:</i> Kim, I have a ton of other things I wanna do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Go do it all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So keep your ass here instead of coming once every two months. Come to the store more! I need yourhelp! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wouldn't it be great to have somebody dress you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want a stylist. &gt;&gt; I need to get the inseam of your pants. I don't mind going down.
