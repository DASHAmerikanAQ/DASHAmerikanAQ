- &gt;&gt; KIM: We should take a selfie. I haven't taken one with you in... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, I'm on the cover saying I'm sleeping with Kendall this week. &gt;&gt; KIM: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did you see that? You didn't see this magazine? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at this. It's just absurd. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at this! It looks like we're leaving, like, a late-night getaway. It was midday having lunch. I don't understand how it's legal to print this Somebody called me middle-aged the other day. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? When is middle age? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know. They're like, "The middle-aged father of three." I was like, "Holy! I'm a middle-aged father of three?" &gt;&gt; KIM: You're just 30. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: 31, but yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's young. I feel like middle-aged is, like, 40. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's, like, a lot to deal with. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a lot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, I'm like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you think people are prettier these days? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, of course. You can go pimp your ride anywhere in town. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Walk in, ten minutes later you're prettier. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Back in the day, nobody could do this. I mean, imagine before fake boobs? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How long ago was that? &gt;&gt; KIM: When did fake boobs start? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know, but thank God. Knock on wood. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Saggy old boobs hanging to the ground? No thanks. I'll pass. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Keep it moving, ladies. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, 'cause I have, like, stretch marks and cellulite, he does a little more for me. You don't have stretch marks, I'm sure. That's okay. God is fair. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: "God is fair." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When you are photographed all the time, it's natural to have insecurities or want to change certain things about yourself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, what are you doing, you guys? You look so pretty today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What about me? My turn. &gt;&gt; KIM: You look amazing. Did you darken your hair? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. She pulled it back and I hate it pulled back. &gt;&gt; KIM: That picture. No, no, no. It was just that picture. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, everyone thought my hair was darker. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, we were talking about it today. What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to get my whole butt-- the stretch mark and the cellulite laser-- that we're doing on my butt. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, I don't really have anything to do. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, 'cause I got a tan, so I can't really do much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, you're just here to enjoy the ride? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: You, too. How are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Good to see you. Good. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: So, are we ready? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo, I got you a dress, well, I see, like, your ass is so huge, I just don't know if it'll fit your ass. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do I give it to Kylie or do I give it to you? &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Excuse me, we are working here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, what do you think we're doing? We're trying to make it smaller. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait, what? That is so cute. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It hurts. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it good? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It stings like a mother! &gt;&gt; KIM: I just looked right into the light. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it gonna do something to us? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, are we bad? &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: I've been looking at it for the past ten years. Nothing happened. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whenever you guys want to go, I'm good to go. &gt;&gt; DR. OURIAN: Perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, do you want to know something life-changing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let's hear it. &gt;&gt; KIM: In-N-Out just opened up right down the street. In Calabasas. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know I've never had In-N-Out before, right? &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe, what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't eat red meat. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't care. You'll have the cheese fries. And the grilled cheese. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I didn't even know they had cheese fries. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wait, wait, where did it open? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. It's the talk of Calabasas. Look at Kylie and Tyga out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look at Kylie's lips. It's changed her life. Lips are just... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She got a little crazy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but they changed her life. &gt;&gt; KIM: They did. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The lips changed her life. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, guys. Sure, at first, right now... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want her lips. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You've seen them in person? First got it done-- they were great, they were fine. They were perfect size and they looked natural. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, that? Come on. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, she's also just grown into her face. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, she made her eyebrows a little thicker. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, you can see it... &gt;&gt; KIM: And she knows how to put on makeup. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's grown up, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Kylie has always been so insecure about her lips since she was a little girl. And I think over time, she decided she wanted to plump up her lips a little bit with filler, and I get that. I mean, we all have insecurities. I just want Kylie to stay strong and positive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The lips... they changed her life. &gt;&gt; KIM: But you know what the problem is? She still draws her lips way over. And she still... goes, like, pouts it out in photos. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You know, Kylie's lips-- it's not permanent, it's not gonna stay there forever if she doesn't want it to. And if it makes her feel better about herself, then why not? I just don't want her to take it too far, 'cause she's a beautiful girl, and I don't think she needs anything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She has the best body. Like, I would kill to have her body. Kim, you're the body person, so you need to talk to her. You're just, like, the guru. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She's gonna be like, "I can live my life however I want. And if that's what I'm feeling, then that's what I'm gonna do." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You ready, bud? &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, guys, how are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nice to see you. &gt;&gt; MAN: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? This is Mason. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's gonna look at furniture with us. &gt;&gt; MAN: So, guys, what's going on today? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Um, just trying to find some stuff to fill this house up. &gt;&gt; MAN: Nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Recently, I've been doing really well with developing properties in Los Angeles. Basically, we need to fill up a 5,000-foot house. I hit a small road bump. My interior decorator ended up leaving to move to Europe, so I thought I'd bring Kourtney along for some furniture shopping, 'cause, you know, the girl's got a good eye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I mean, I've seen the house, and I know what needs to happen. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, so let's... Be my guest. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. This is a cool chair, doll. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Pretty comfortable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For the master. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, that's cool. &gt;&gt; MAN: It's cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I like these marble tables. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right? I like this a lot. &gt;&gt; MASON: It's bum bum. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thank you. I appreciate that coming from you. Oh, doll, you'd like these. Come look. That could be cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really cool. Bigger squares? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, also, I like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's more like ours. All right, shall we? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, Mason. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shall we, Mase? &gt;&gt; MASON: Shall we. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like we could be, like, the ultimate, um, design team. Like, you could buy the houses. I could design them and fix them up. Why don't you just... have me help you? You would be really lucky. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm sure I would be. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You would be very lucky to have my expert opinion. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes, you're not kidding. You're not kidding. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And my expert taste. So we picked the couch. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, yeah, I think the couch is a pretty good one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to tell you a secret, Mom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I would want the chairs to be a little modern if I did a wood table. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to tell you a secret, Mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; MASON: When are we gonna go home? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Soon. Let's keep her moving. &gt;&gt; RAPHY: Kim, when we last met, you gave us a lot of inspiration, uh, things that you want to see on this new experience when we launch. Um, so over the last several weeks, we have created these boards, which we hope, um, really capture everything you told us. Everything from-from photography to color palates, uh... &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you asking me to pick one? &gt;&gt; RAPHY: No. We-we... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, good. 'Cause it's really hard. I'm gonna relaunch my Web site soon. My Web site's a little dated. I just have to completely redo it in order to stay relevant. &gt;&gt; RAPHY: We wanted this to feel sexy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; RAPHY: And we want it to feel, um, like you. Of course, this is not to suggest the way the Web site will look... &gt;&gt; KIM: I like it though. &gt;&gt; RAPHY: Oh, good, great. All right, it-it's... We're really pleased with these. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just think this really captured what we're looking for, and it's, like, the beauty space, the fashion space, and just overall fun lifestyle. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, totally. &gt;&gt; KIM: So it inspires me to now, like, okay, we need to go take more Polaroids! We need to... have content! This makes me really excited to have this whole experience for people to really see and really feel what my personality is. &gt;&gt; RAPHY: Right. Very desirable place to come to, you know, be inspired by the things that you're inspired by. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have to really reinvent myself through my Web site. I want to do really cool fun, like, artsy things. I can't wait for it to launch. I definitely want mine to have a different feel than my sisters'. &gt;&gt; RAPHY: Okay. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: And a different, like... vibe and look and... No hate, no shade. Just... I want them all to be equally as good. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You know, I love the references in it. I think it takes it to another level. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love it. &gt;&gt; MAN: Beautiful, Kim. Marvelous. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You look so good. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie just launched her first solo project, which is her hair extensions, and I'm so proud of her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; TYGA: Looks nice. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; TYGA: Congratulations. This is really nice. I'm really, like, proud of you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: This is one of the first things you're, like, doing out on your own. Are you excited? Are you nervous? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm so excited. I think it's gonna be awesome. My followers and stuff know that I'm just crazy and change my hair so much. So it'll be cool for them to change it with me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so proud of her. It's really scary to do things on your own, and all my babies are just getting older. I can't handle it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: You got to get out of here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I do. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Can you hang for a second? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes, I can. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: All right, so, I mean, you're branching out into this beauty, fashion business. Um, couple of weeks ago, people were, like, talking a lot about your lips. Tell me, tell me about them. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's the first time anyone has asked me about my lips. It's kind of weird. I just don't want to talk about my lips. It's just an insecurity of mine. So it makes me feel a little uncomfortable. I just want to... &gt;&gt; KIM: We have to top secret get out of here. If anyone follows us, we're, like, &gt;&gt; TRAN: Beautiful. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: So dope! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What if you got rid of this whole wall? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That a joke? Kourtney's been in this house for five minutes, and she's already becoming a pain in the ass. Mixing all this work and pleasure is only giving me anxiety. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Um, a couple of weeks ago, people were, like, talking a lot about your lips. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My lips are just an insecurity of mine. So it makes me feel a little uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Tell me... tell me about them. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just want to... Let's just stop. Let's get over the subject. Say what you whatever you want, yeah. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Thank you so much. Good luck with all this. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: This is awesome. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: You should be really proud. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. No one's ever asked me about my lips. My heart literally dropped. They were like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They asked you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, they were like, "So, all this lip talk, you know, like, like, how do you feel about it?" And I was like, "Uh..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie decided to plump her lips, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think if you've done something though, it is right to cop up to it. If you avoid the question, you're gonna look like a liar. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm not ever gonna deny or confirm anything. It's too much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're all here to trip us up, so it's good you're just doing your thing. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Just be aware. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's do it. We're changing the front and the color. It makes it much more contemporary. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott and I both love interior design, so I'm really excited to work together on this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: She's gonna try to decorate the interior. We'll decorate the exterior. &gt;&gt; MAN: Let's do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: After having the baby, I think this is the perfect first thing to dive into. &gt;&gt; MAN: Look at this view today. It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can see the water. Forget about it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This little square of the wall, it's unnecessary. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've never been up here. This yard's really beautiful, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Then imagine if this whole thing was gone, you know? Scott? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Um, what-what... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can I show you something? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yes? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What if you got rid of this whole wall? Like, even this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT:Is that a joke? Is that a joke? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This part. 'Cause this hallway is so narrow, and you don't need it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney's been in this house for five minutes, and she's already knocking down multiple walls, changing hardware, changing doors. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This door has to go; it's super annoying. I mean, by the time she gets done, I'll be losing money. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They kind of built the closet weird. No drawers, no shelves. &gt;&gt; MAN: We can upgrade that. Some-some of the stuff they used though is really cheap, so... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My house, did you... You probably didn't notice, but it has no moldings, but then it has, like, a line, like, that goes in. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, like shadow lines? That's expensive. You don't want that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's shadow lines? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Literally, it goes straight flat, and then there's an indented line in. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, we could potentially do that. It's gonna take additional, like, taking off the molding, patchwork, different things like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: True. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know Kourtney is good at decorating, and I like her style, but, I mean, listen, this is supposed to be a business project, so I'm on the fence now of her taste. It's just maybe a little too expensive for me. This chick is crazy. My designer over here. &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, she has good taste. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, not for here. Man. &gt;&gt; STYLIST: Can you shake it out backwards a little bit? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm doing a photo that I'm so excited about. &gt;&gt; STYLIST: You want to just rest it, maybe rest it on your shoulder blades? &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Good. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, guys, it's Kylie, and check out my new shoot for Remix. &gt;&gt; VIDEOGRAPHER: Perfect. &gt;&gt; STYLIST: Good attempt. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: You have to tell me if I talk too fast, because New Zealanders talk at, like, 100 miles an hour, and we just... People get lost. You're obviously the youngest of the family. What do you want people to know about Kylie Jenner as your own woman? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm about to turn 18, so I feel like now's the time where I want to for sure start doing a lot of my own stuff. So I think this year's gonna be a good year for me. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: What's a normal day like for you? What's a normal day for Kylie Jenner if you're not doing photo shoots and that sort of thing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, I'm still in school. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So I'm homeschooled, so I meet with my teacher, like, every day I don't... I'm not doing anything. Um, and then, I don't know, I like to just surround myself with a lot of friends. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: Mm-hmm. When we asked readers what they wanted to know from Kylie, is they just said she has the most amazing lips. Tell us her secret. How does she get these beautiful lips? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I have temporary lip fillers. It's just an insecurity of mine, and it's what I wanted to do. I'm just not ready to talk to reporters about my lips yet, because everyone always picks us apart. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Um, well, the color, everyone thinks I use, like, one certain color. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So, I use, like, six different colors all the time. So, yeah. I want to admit to the lips, but people are so quick to judge me on everything, so I might have tiptoed around the truth, but I didn't lie. &gt;&gt; STEVEN: Okay, it was so nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mason was talking a mile a minute today. He was very excited. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I-I ordered him pizza last night. He takes a bite, he's like, "Oh, yeah! Ooh!" And he's like, "Aah!" I go, "What are you doing?" He goes, "Oh, it's just so good." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does Kourt not let him have pizza? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I just don't think that we order pizza a lot, and he loves it. It was fun last night. We did that. I took Kourt to one of the properties that I bought that I'm gonna sell. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How many houses are you flipping? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: As many as I can get my little hands on. One of the houses in BH needs to get furnished, and I had a designer. He kind of flaked out on me. So Kourt was kind of the next best thing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:So Kourt's doing your furniture shopping? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mixing business with pleasure? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's kind of like two and no bitch. I don't know if it's a good idea. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Twoand no bitch. I think she is a bitch, and you're the &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's only one. No, I don't want another involved. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wow, what? Where's the other? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's not around. It's not here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys both know you don't spend enough time together. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think we spend too much time together. I just don't know if we're gonna clash about some of the furniture or style, and I don't want to get into a fight with her like I would regularly argue with a decorator. And then it's like, you know... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I think you know her taste. She has, I think, incredible style. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's good, really good, yeah, amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's so good at interior design. I always say that's what she should be doing. You guys are obviously gonna argue, 'cause that's what... It's frustrating, but you just have to do it in the right way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You think? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I think it will, like, be fun. So I think you two together could really... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Could be... could be a power... power, power couple. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are obviously gonna-- you're not gonna sign a contract with her. Why don't you try it... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, no, I'm gonna need her on a retainer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's gonna charge you a pretty penny. I'm sure you just, like... got to lick her down there and she'll... do it for free. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Got to liquor her down? Oh, lick her down? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like in downstairs? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. Do you not do that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, after all the kids came out of there, it's kind of weird now, isn't it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I am over... I don't want to talk about it anymore, actually. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, no, I'm pretty sick to my stomach about it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I don't want to talk about it anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can we finish up hair there? &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: You're 99.9% done. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, cool. So I'll drive with Stephanie. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: I'll follow. &gt;&gt; KIM: And we have to, like, top secret get out of here. Like, if anyone follows us, we're, like, So I'm trying to create original content for my Web site. I met this photographer who does these really cool, fun pics out in the desert with paint, so I'm gonna sneak away and do a really cool, top secret nude shoot. I think it'll just be so much fun. I'm gonna, like, literally lay down in the back of Stephanie's car so no one follows. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: We'll see you there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ah! I'm so nervous. &gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: It'll be awesome. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're gonna so know this trick, then. It's kind of ridiculous that I'm hiding in the car, but, you know... you got to do what you got to do. If any paparazzi follows, these pictures won't be exclusive. This will be a little tricky. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A regular designer would not come over here and bother me about interior decorating at 10:00 at night. I worked all day, I'm tired... I need some professionalism. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you think about this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We still need to create some boundaries here, doll. &gt;&gt; KIM: I did an interview, and I was like, "Kylie lines her lips really high." And so now I feel like I look like a liar. I need to talk to her. &gt;&gt; KIM: And you'll just tell me, like, what position to be in... &gt;&gt; TRAN: Yeah, of course. Yep. I'm very directional. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Perfect. I like that. &gt;&gt; TRAN: Very directional. &gt;&gt; KIM: Makes it easy. &gt;&gt; TRAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are we gonna need more baby oil than that? &gt;&gt; TRAN: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, cool. &gt;&gt; TRAN: The last shoot I did, I had, like, half of this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, so, I mean, I'm relaunching my Web site soon and I just wanted, you know, some original content for it. &gt;&gt; TRAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then cool stuff to... just cool stuff to put out there. &gt;&gt; TRAN: Cool, cool. Yeah, the stuff we're shooting today is gonna be very edgy. Cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; TRAN: Um, it's more like... the Helmut Newtons, black and white, rich tones to it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; TRAN: Um, we're probably gonna do most of your stuff hair slicked back. &gt;&gt; HAIRDRESSER: Hair slicked back-- you want it now? Good. &gt;&gt; TRAN: Okay, so this is the white paint idea, okay? This is what it's gonna look like in color, okay? That's what ours is gonna look like. &gt;&gt; KIM: I love that. Cool. &gt;&gt; TRAN: Cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have psoriasis, just in a few spots... &gt;&gt; TRAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and on my stomach that I'm sure we can cover up; or if not, we'll... &gt;&gt; TRAN: Yeah, it's not a problem. &gt;&gt; KIM: But it's like, I'm insecure about it when I shoot. &gt;&gt; TRAN: Yeah, anything you want me to know, just let me know ahead of time. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have psoriasis. There's nothing I can do about it, so there's no reason I should ever feel uncomfortable. So, to make myself feel better, I lay out all my insecurities before I start a shoot, just in hopes that no one will really be focused on that. I just want to do fun, like, artsy things. &gt;&gt; TRAN: We're gonna focus mostly on front, like, half-body shots, side, face, shoulders and some of your upper back. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want to capture really cool moments and have some really great shoots and, you know, be nude and do all this cool stuff. &gt;&gt; TRAN: Beautiful. I love your skin. So nice and smooth. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, it's so dope! &gt;&gt; TRAN: Beautiful. Try to put your chin up. Nice. You're doing great. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Amazing. &gt;&gt; TRAN: Chin up, look away. Turn your body towards me a little more. There you go. Perfect. &gt;&gt; KIM: God, if a paparazzi was here, I would die. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are we wearing the same boots? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yep. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you should take a pic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're not exactly the same. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, then get the hell out of here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mine are a little bit more high fashion. &gt;&gt; SCOTT:I'm a guy. I don't need to wear super high. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Super high"? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Fashion. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So... I have some design ideas ready to show you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean? For the house? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's 10:00 at night. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Since when... That's all you do at night is look on your computer and... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, this is chill time. You work for me right now. A regular designer would not come over here and bother me about interior decorating at 10:00 at night, nor would I let that happen. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're lucky that I'm gracing you with my ideas. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Listen. I agree I am lucky, but I think we need to set some boundaries. 9:00 to 6:00 you could come to me with ideas. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 9:00 to 6:00? You're not even up until 11:00. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Perfect. 11:00 to 5:00. Your window just got smaller. How do you like that? You see, it was like this, it went like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want me to go in the other room right now and e-mail these to you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sure, and I'll look at them tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. And I'll get back to you before 5:00 p.m. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're gonna be so excited of what I have to show you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love you, I'm so excited, but you have to remember this is chill time. This is wind down. This is not time for me to start thinking about what kind of sofa and what kind of armchair I want to put in the house and what kind of photography I want to put on the walls, and molding... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, just, what do you think about this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, that's pretty cool. We still need to create some boundaries here. This is not time for design meetings. It's late. I worked all day, I'm tired. She's crossing over into hours that are not for me. I don't need her waking me up at 2:00 in the morning, spraying me down with a boob, saying, "Wake up, I found a new chair for the house." I need some professionalism. So are we cool? Like, are we in agreement? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. I have to go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the heck is "A, B, C, D, E, F, G" mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just a phrase I like to use that means... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is that a real phrase? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...the conversation is over. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You've said this before? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You've never heard that phrase? &gt;&gt; SCOTT:No. Have you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. That means the convo is done. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you say "A, B, C, D, E, F, G"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. "G," good-bye. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh. "A" for ass &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, uh, love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: See ya. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hit me tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. I'll be ready to design. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ta ta for now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. What did you do today? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Wait, hold on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have psoriasis on the top of your head. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Want me to take a picture and show you? &gt;&gt; KIM: I haven't has psoriasis ever on my head. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up, really? Do you see, in the front? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, no, that's bronzer. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, is it? Okay. Last night, they asked Lisa Watch What Happens who has her lips done a million times-- they were like, "Do you think Kylie Jenner has had her lips done?" She's like... She, like, wouldn't say yeah. He was like, "Is that a yes?" She was like, "I mean..." &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean... I need to have a serious talk with her, to school her on, like, really what to say, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know, with Kylie, she's trying to avoid these covers of magazines or TV shows. It's not healthy, it's not good for her. Hopefully, in time, I think she'll become more confident with things that she is doing. She'll start to own what she does more. &gt;&gt; KIM: I did an interview in Australia, and I was like, "Kylie lines her lips really high, blah, blah, blah," and that's really what she was doing at that time. And so now I feel like I look like a liar, because I, you know, would totally be lying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know I can't lie if someone asked me. I would kind of have to say. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know I would never lie. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna say, "Of course." I'm gonna say, "Come on. Of course she got her..." &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "...like, plumped up. What do you think happened to her?" &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. It's obvious. You know? Kylie has to be bold and proud. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You got to keep it real. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to talk to her. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a frozen yogurt store. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, we got to go to the furniture store. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's right on the way. I need some frozen yogurt. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We have a time schedule to stay on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's on the right. Get in the right lane. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, no, I'm not going. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Honestly, they were too big yesterday. &gt;&gt; KIM: We've all had our own insecurities; it's just handling it the right way. I don't want you to get, like, carried away. &gt;&gt; KIM: There's not one pic of me on the fridge. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hello! &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Ky. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Norm! I didn't know you were coming! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, you took your hair out. I noticed, but I forgot to tell you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It goes back in tomorrow. I've just had it for too long. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, guess what? I got you a hood dress from online. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh,you! What about me? &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to wear it today, Kendall? Start wearing it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Now I can't wear it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you can. You'll wear it differently. I ordered you a ton of stuff. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right. &gt;&gt; KIM: Norman. I think you look amazing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, amazing. Like, I'm loving the short hair. You just... will you, like, bank a couple selfies? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I love the short hair, right? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Will I what? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just bank a couple selfies. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. I did my makeup so fast. I'm just not feeling myself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Your lips look amazing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall said they were too big yesterday. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Are you talking about her lips? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. I don't want you to get, like, carried away. Lips aren't permanent, but, like, if they ask about your lips, like, own up to it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't know why you guys are even freaking out or talking about this though. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No one needs anything. Everybody's beautiful. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I think if something makes you insecure and you've been feeling that way forever, who doesn't want to look amazing? You only have one life. And what I've realized from what all of us have gone through is do what makes you happy. To an extant. I mean, I don't want you to, like, you know, go crazy. But, like, own up to it. I always tell Kylie, we've all had our own insecurities and there's nothing to be ashamed of. It's just handling it the right way. If someone asks you about your lips, just be honest. Just tell them it's really not that big of a deal. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You guys don't need to worry about this so much. &gt;&gt; KIM: I worry about it literally all the time. It is so hard. Like, I literally... Did you see the picture I posted today-- me and Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, I saw it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone thinks, like, she got her butt done and her hips done and all this stuff. I'm like, "No, I'm legit 20 pounds heavier." But it's important to me 'cause I like what I... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You do realize who you are, right, like you do realize that you're, like, one of the hottest, like... but you know that. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stop. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: No, I'm serious, but you know that. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I... I'm so insecure lately. Like, seriously. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Well, I feel like everyone is. Like you said, being in this... &gt;&gt; KIM: Just with my weight, just with my weight. I cannot leave the house without Spanx. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We have all eyes on us all the time, so especially for me at my age trying to find myself, it's hard to not let it affect you. Having older sisters with some of the same insecurities as me helps me a lot and makes me feel like it's okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just make sure you keep everything subtle and don't go overboard, and I'm always there if you want my opinion. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: As of now, I'm good. But thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Whoa. Look at that lady. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the heck? She's got a pillow behind her head, the visor, and she's got a thing on the steering wheel. Is she kidding me? What is she, a horse? Are you...? You got to take a picture of that. That's the sickest thing I've ever seen in my life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY:Oh, God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God, she's got a fake dog! She's got a fake dog in the passenger side! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, how do you know it's fake? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you see it? Just look at it! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I see, but pay attention to the road. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That is amazing! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, what would she need a fake dog for? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So she can go in the HOV lane? She is killing it! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you excited to go to the store? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The furniture store? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at some rugs? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I thought we were shopping for couches and chairs. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We can shop for it all, but I... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So you have a main focus of only rugs today? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wanted to show you some rugs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, okay, all right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: On the way, there's a frozen yogurt store that we could stop. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, why don't we just call Meg and tell her to pick it up, bring it to the house? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I want it now. It's on the way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I... I totally understand, but you're not pregnant, you're not craving things anymore and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I actually am. When you're breast-feeding... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, you got to be kidding me; you have an excuse for everything! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I actually crave things more when I'm I'm breast-feeding. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Stop. We got to go to the furniture store. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's right on the way. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It doesn't matter if it's on the way. It's still gonna be 20 minutes with you-- you're indecisive. You're gonna walk in the store. You're gonna say, "Should I get vanilla? Should I get chocolate? Should I get a swirl? Should I mix...? Strawberry, banana, pineapple." I don't know. It'll be 20 minutes no matter how you cut it. We're not going to this yogurt store; we're going right to furniture shopping. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I thought one of the benefits of us working together was, like, we can still have fun, and I don't know why he's taking this so seriously. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The GPS is set for the furniture store, right, not the yogurt place? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I know you don't lie, so I'm asking you... is it the furniture store or the yogurt place in the GPS? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a little yog and frozen... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need some frozen yogurt. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We have a time schedule to stay on. It's not on the way! If it was on the way, you wouldn't have to put it in GPS! It would be on the side of the street! We would stop! Where's the furniture store?! We've obviously gone out of our way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's on the right. Get in the right lane. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No! No, I'm not going! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I need a little crunch. But I don't know what that should be. Let me see what's up here. Do you think my crunch should be Oreos? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is unbelievable. If Kourtney's gonna be professional, she can't be asking for froyo breaks. This would not be okay if I was paying somebody. This is becoming just way too messy. The professional and relationship is crossing over, and that's exactly what I didn't want to happen. I don't really know what I'm gonna do because I do need her. But I just don't need this whole situation. This is "ri-doo-culous." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks for stopping. &gt;&gt; KIM: If they ask about your lips, what are you gonna say? "Hey, Kylie, so tell me... have you ever done your lips?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you were a regular decorator, you wouldn't be busting my balls. You wouldn't make me stop for yogurt. You wouldn't make me stop 'cause I got to pump the breasts; that's not tolerated! You being the decorator just doesn't work. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh! That shot is so nice! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You mean Brian Bowen Smith? &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to show you a picture. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is this from? &gt;&gt; KIM: From my desert shoot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: With Brian or no? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no. This guy Kesler. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, that's cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna, like... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Love that. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we'll do, like, a whole story in black and white, and then we did them all, like, in color. I'm gonna use these, like, all for my Web site, so I can have all original content. So that, like, my Web site has, like, the coolest images. So we'll do, like, a whole story in black and white. I like how raw that looks. I am so excited of how this turned out. Social media has always played such an important role in my career. It's really important that I have original content for my Web site and that we keep the fans interested. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is that where you went when you disappeared that day? &gt;&gt; KIM: I did disappear, and do you even know what we did? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: We went to KFC on the way there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: On your way to a photo shoot? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, can you believe it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm all for the way home, not for the way there. &gt;&gt; KIM: I thought it was just, like, chicken. I didn't eat, like, the potatoes or anything like that, you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just fried greasy bucket of chicken. &gt;&gt; KIM:And then we went to In-N-Out on the way home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mmm! &gt;&gt; KIM: Kylie! You look so cute! Oh, my gosh, you look so sexy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, so I love this short. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really cut it. You do? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You really cut it? No, you didn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Yeah. How else would I have it on? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Short hair really does make a difference. You're making me want it back. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're actually not making me want long hair back. This is like... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wild. You're also, like, a mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: But it's... Don't start with the mom hairdo. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You look like a mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is... I do? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You look like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Today, Kylie has her big so I'm stopping by to let her know that if she needs anything, I'm here, and I'm just gonna kind of hang out and support her. All right, so really quick before I go-- if they ask about your lips, what are you gonna say? "Hey, Kylie, so tell me... have you ever done your lips?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This whole thing is only giving me anxiety. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should understand my requirements. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I do! As a partner in life! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, if I was working for someone else, you would think it was okay for them to fire me because I had to pump? &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, so really quick, before I go-- if they ask about your lips, what are you gonna say? "Hey, Kylie, so tell me, have you ever done your lips?" &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, I feel like in the past I always said no. No one asked me really about my lips specifically. But yes, for about a year, I overlined my lips and it was a really big insecurity in my life, so, yes, I-I've plumped them up. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just say that. Like, be you, be funny. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You think? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Do you want me to sit in? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I got this. I think I got this. It intimidates me that people are so quick to judge me on everything. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I'm gonna go. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right. But if my sisters can own up to their insecurities, then so can I. Hello. Kylie. Teen Vogue. You look amazing. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. Actually, I feel like... can I take that side? &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: You want this side, Kylie? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do you want this stuff? &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: Oh, yeah, thanks, Kylie. So here we are to talk about cover shoot. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yes. &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: I have to start by asking you about your style and your look. You have been voted the most stylish Jenner/Kardashian. I can see where people say that, 'cause it seems like you have a lot of fun experimenting. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think I'm, like, a little edgier and darker than Kendall's style or whatever, but I just like to play around. I change my style so often, I feel like, I'm like, punk one... &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...and, like, super girly or... I like to have fun with it, 'cause I'm young. &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: I heard you're good at doing your own makeup. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I love to do my own makeup. &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: How did you learn to do it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like I get... since I was way younger, I've gotten my makeup done so much... &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...that I've learned so many tips and what to use and this and that and just how they do it. &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: So the girls reading the magazine want to know your thoughts about how to deal with pressure and haters. I mean, everybody has moments where they feel insecure. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. I don't know, I feel like I've heard the worst anyone can say about me, like, over and over, every day. My self-esteem definitely, like, wasn't good at a point, I guess. &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And especially having, like, the most beautiful sisters. I don't know, just, like... do whatever makes you feel good. And try to be as, like, confident as possible. &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: I think you do that. I think you definitely show a lot of confidence in your clothing and your beauty. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: And I think just going through that age is just... it's so difficult. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, it really is. &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: It's so nice talking with you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Nice talking to you. Although this reporter didn't exactly ask me directly about my lips, I feel ready to just stop tiptoeing around the truth and just let go of my insecurities. &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: You seem like you have a lot of fun with your look. So beauty maintenance doesn't bum you out? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It does. It's a lot, to be a girl. &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: It's a lot. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It's so much to be a girl. &gt;&gt; ASTLEY: My 16-year-old daughter's a big fan of yours. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Aw. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney. I'm gonna need to speak to you downstairs in the office, if you could come down, please. Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. We should have a dinner party. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's what you're thinking about? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh! This chair is much lower than I imagined. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, I just feel like this whole... you being the decorator thing just doesn't work. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Doesn't work for what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doesn't work for us. And it's starting to affect our relationship and our life. Mixing all this work and pleasure has made it more complicated and more annoying and just frustrating. You're bothering me at 11:00 at night about things that I'd rather discuss during the day, and it just... nothing of it is what I thought it was gonna be. If you were a regular decorator that I was paying an hourly fee, wouldn't be busting my balls, wouldn't make me stop for yogurt, wouldn't make me stop 'cause I got to pump the breasts. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You, of anyone, should understand my... requirements. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I do! As a partner in life. Not as a person who's trying to make some money. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So if I was working for someone else, you would think it was okay for them to get rid of me and fire me because I had to pump? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You, of anyone, should understand my requirements. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I do! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So if I was working for someone else, you would think it was okay for them to fire me because I had to pump? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: If you were in the car with another person and you were trying to decorate their home and you were like, "Hey, do you mind stopping? I want some froyo." That's not tolerated. All I'm trying to say is I could see this only getting worse and not better. And that scares me, 'cause I don't want it to affect our real life and our relationship. Obviously, this is not a hobby, it's not fun for me. This is... something I'm taking on as a daytime business deal, to make money. You know, for you it's more of a hobby and I get it, but I really need somebody who I can just pay that'll deal with it during the day and get it done. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Well, that's disappointing. I feel like, in general, it was nice to have a common interest. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But this whole thing is only giving me anxiety. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It really could've been a great thing, Scott and I working together, if he was willing to work around my schedule. But we have to do what works best for our relationship and for the sake of our family, and it's just not worth it for me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want to have fun. That's... this is... There's other times for that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, then you're not the partner for me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I am, when I'm outside of the office. But inside? It's only about money, no pleasure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And to me, I actually take enjoyment in this, so... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...I will have to buy my own houses and flip them, and I'll be your competitor. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We'll have a flipping contest. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I may buy the houses that you're looking for, and because people like me more, they're gonna give me a better deal. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whatever you want to do. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Gonna give you some motivation. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A run for my money, you might say. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: See you on the flip side. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get out of here. I love you, even though you're not the right businessperson for me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sure, pal. &gt;&gt; SGURA: Let me know if you like this, and then we'll do tighter. Okay, go. Okay, here we go! Yes, yes, you look perfect, perfect, perfect. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can I see it? I need some inspiration. So cool. &gt;&gt; SGURA: Ready, gang? Next shot. Maybe lean on the... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We are shooting for the cover, and it meets and it's so fun. &gt;&gt; SGURA: Okay, ready. Can we have music again? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What is this? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I feel like the other music made me want to do a cover shoot. &gt;&gt; SGURA: Get her that music, please. âŞ âŞ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Growing up in the public eye, I would back out on things because I wasn't comfortable, and now I feel comfortable enough to face some of these things that I was insecure about before, and it feels good. &gt;&gt; SGURA: Yes, yes, yes, perfect, perfect, perfect! Way to go! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm so tired of lying. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you planning on not being Bruce any time soon? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I just don't like when people say Bruce is gonna be gone. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The last thing in the world I want to do is hurt any one of you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just live the happiest life you can live. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's pretty wild that you're gonna live two lives in one lifetime. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. There's nothing like freeing your soul and surrounding yourself with people that make you feel good about yourself.
