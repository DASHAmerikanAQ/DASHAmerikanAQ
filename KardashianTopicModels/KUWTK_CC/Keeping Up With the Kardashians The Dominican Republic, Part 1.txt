- &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Previously on Keeping Up With the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; MAN: Todd Waterman. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, Todd Waterman is the guy who I left Robert Kardashian for. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would have told him off. Wish I was there. Why would she even talk to him? So, did you get his number? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I didn't get his number. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I was thinking about seeing him one more time. &gt;&gt; KIM: You just hope that there's no feelings left. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know if she would even tell anyone if she met up with him. Answer the phone. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; NOELLE: I'm good. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a little rattled. I was supposed to go and meet Todd just now. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I couldn't do it. I just left. I just turned around and got into my car and drove away. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This just doesn't feel right. It feels like I'm sneaking around, and maybe the healthiest thing for me to do is just not see Todd, so I'm gonna go home. Bruce doesn't even know that I was gonna meet him today. &gt;&gt; NOELLE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm feeling really, really guilty about that. I really have to pick the right time to tell Bruce about this. I have to get it all straight in 29 00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:40,734 my head first so that I feel really comfortable about what's going on here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is for my friend John. All he we have to do is draw a butterfly so we can include it in our silent auction. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna do black. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna draw a Goth butterfly? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's, like, depressing. It's for charity. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For our family vacation... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where should we go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. We could go to Ireland, see the leprechauns. &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe a pot of gold. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've always wanted to go to Ireland. I think it has a lot of culture, and it's just something different than our typical family vacations. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, is it gonna be Ireland, guys? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's Ireland. &gt; KIM: Is Khloe coming this year? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Khloe's already told me she's missing the family vacation. She missed Christmas Eve. She missed Easter, but where she belongs is exactly where she is, and that's with Lamar. But it still makes me sad. That's really pretty. I take it back. 52 00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,438 This looks like a penis with wings. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I asked Kim to come shopping with me, because I have something to tell her, and in case she doesn't like it, she can't yell at a pregnant person in public. So don't think I'm annoying, but I don't want to go to Ireland anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom already booked the castle. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, she didn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, she did. Ever since Kourtney got pregnant, she's, like, extra indecisive, extra hormonal, and it's really frustrating. Why didn't you think of this before? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause I didn't know how far it was. One thing during my pregnancy is, I listen to my gut. I don't do anything that doesn't feel natural. I'm not gonna push myself. Everyone lets Khloe off the hook for not even coming on the trips, so I'm not gonna worry about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, you can't have people book something, and then change it. Everyone's gonna be pissed. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you think I should by a defibrillator? &gt;&gt; KIM: Who has a defibrillator? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, honey, will you grab me the defibrillator? Think I'm gonna have another heartie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who would have thought? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's a great gift for her. Here's your defibrillator. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, guys, so we're here today 'cause Little Miss Indecisive... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh! &gt;&gt; KIM: ...can't decide where she wants to go on our family vacay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I want to go somewhere tropical. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Right. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why do you guys only like warm, though? &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, I mean, at this point, you really don't have a say, 'cause you change your mind, like, way too much... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...so we can't even go with you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why don't we do this? Everybody write down on a piece of paper where they want to go. We'll put it in a pot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Pick one. For all the people in this family to make one decision is probably the most difficult thing we can possibly do, so we got to get a little creative. And... &gt;&gt; KIM: His plate's full. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The Dominican Republic. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's mine! I am so excited that we picked Dominican Republic. It's gorgeous there. I think you guys will like it, 'cause there's monkeys. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do it, Kendall. Kim, do it. There. Are you all right with this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: As long as it's safe, I'm down. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, let's all put it in... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Locked and loaded. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...for the Dominican Republic. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Dominican. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here we are. Here we come. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is what racing's like. All you're doing is sitting around all the time waiting. But we could be in worse places. Today I got Scott, my son Brandon and my son Burt, and we're gonna run some cars. Hey, man, how you doing? &gt;&gt; RON: Bruce, how are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good to see you. &gt;&gt; RON: Good to see you. Thanks for coming out today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, my pleasure. This is my son Brandon. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Brandon. How are you? &gt;&gt; RON: Brandon, pleasure to meet you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My other son, Burt-- he's around here somewhere. &gt;&gt; RON: Cool. I think I saw him out there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And this is, uh, my friend Scott. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How you doing? Scott. &gt;&gt; RON: How you doing, Scott? Ron. Pleasure. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. "Oh, and this is my, uh, friend Scott." As if he barely knows me. We're a little bit more than just acquaintances. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, come on. Let's get going. &gt;&gt; RON: So, who's up first? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I'm actually very excited. Let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love this stuff. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Wouldn't-- yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I love the car. Uh, we had a fun day. Anyway, have you seen Scott? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: No, I have not seen him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I haven't seen him in a while. I'm, like, looking all over the place. Where did he go? Couple people start saying, "Oh, he left." Left?! Why? I went out on a limb to get him in here, you know? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, Robbie's here. &gt;&gt; ROB: Will you pass me the fruit? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you want the fruit? You can't believe what just happened. I did that car event, you know? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, how'd that go? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We take a couple of laps in the cars. About a half hour later I think, where is Scott? Lady goes, "Oh, he left." &gt;&gt; ROB: That's pretty messed up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, Scott really ticked me off. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's just his personality. It's not like he's intentionally doing something to hurt you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what? There's too many personalities in this family. And Scott's one that I have a hard time dealing with. Going on a vacation with him? Right now, I'm not too excited about that. 148 00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:25,845 Let Kourtney deal with him. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's a whole other situation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're finally ready for our big family vacation. Hands up. We're all going to the Dominican Republic. I invited Spencer and Maddy, because Spencer and Maddy are Kendall and Kylie's best friends. Are you gonna have the best trip, or what? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: We are. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right? It's not a trip totally full of adults. 161 00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,979 &gt;&gt; SPENCER: I am so excited. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Ah. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Oh. &gt;&gt; TOM: Okay, the toilet situation-- the problem in here is this particular toilet requires... &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you ready for the Dominican? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. We're just finishing up... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...with our toilet situation. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, where's your luggage? Come on, we don't want to miss our flight. Scott, do you want to take your girlfriend's luggage down? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get this bag out of here. &gt;&gt; TOM: That's your shower valve. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt, seriously, we're gonna miss our flight. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't even want to go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why don't you want to go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So go, and I'll see you. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is a family vacation, you have to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll go tomorrow. Kourtney wants to change her flight. Like, I... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We can't change the flight. We got to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, we'll go in the morning. I'd rather sleep here. I'm not gonna sleep well on the plane. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's probably not 100 flights going there. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're dealing with a crazy woman, sir. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go. &gt;&gt; TOM: I don't think so. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's so indecisive... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's 11... it's 11:13 right now. I think we're gonna board... maybe, like, ten more minutes. I really can't relax until the rest of my family are here. So when Kim and Kourtney and Scott and Mason arrive, let the party begin. Rob, her butt crack's showing. You're gonna hurt her, Rob. Come on, put her down. Put her down. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is weird. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ready to go to sleep. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I do not want to have a five-hour layover right now. I'm tired, I'm pregnant. I feel rushed. It doesn't feel natural to be going. &gt;&gt; KIM: You are so weird. Kourtney is not even ready to go. She just seems like this is not even a priority and she doesn't care if she misses her flight. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So now we're not going? &gt;&gt; KIM: You are so rude and inconsiderate. I'm not gonna miss my flight, so I'm gonna go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... my... God. This is gonna be a really great week. Where is Kourtney and Scott and Mason? &gt;&gt; KIM: Being pregnant this time has, like, really changed her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not exactly the way I thought this trip would start out. I can't believe that they're not on that plane. She better show up. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mom. So, I missed the flight. I've checked with the greeter. She's called, and there's no other place out for the rest of the night. I think Kourtney doesn't even realize that her indecisive behavior affects everyone else. I mean, the only other option is to get a private plane. I will try to text you as soon as I figure out what's going on. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow! This place is absolutely beautiful and breathtaking. This is gonna be a really great week. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well... we made it, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is pretty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott is coming, right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Scott's coming with Kourt and Mason and Kim. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's been kind of bugging me lately. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He says, "You do all these fun things and then you don't invite me." We want to go race cars, so I invite him-- he leaves. Scott was just so unappreciative. On this vacation, I think probably the best thing for me to do as far as Scott is just kind of keep my distance. I'm a little ticked off right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really bizarre. But that's bizarre. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MAN: Hello. How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. How are you? Thank you very much. Oh, wow. We're staying at this villa that's right on the water, and it's magical. "Welcome to Casa de Campo. We have a surprise for you if you can find the yellow octopus." I think I'm gonna need a yellow drink for that little... alcohol. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. I'm usually the one who plans all the surprises and all the excitement, so this feels kind of fun. "Congratulations! You have found the first clue. Your prize awaits you at the highest point in your villa." ♫ ♫ Amazing! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What a great surprise! Are you a married guy, bring your whole family down here, or what? &gt;&gt; MAN: Single. Having fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Single?! It's really time for Kim to date somebody who's kind of normal. &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Well... what's wrong with that? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not trying to date anybody. Disinvite him. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... my... God. Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe's here! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wearing matching clothes! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know! Baby, when did you get here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been waiting for you guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so happy you're here. This is crazy! I'm so excited! Oh, my God! Once we get everybody else here, we're gonna have the time of our lives. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love that I actually pulled off this surprise. It makes me feel really good, and I'm excited that I'm here. Get a drink! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now let's drink. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, funny. I'm so happy you're here. I really am. It's never the same without you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got, like, a pissed-off text from Kim. I don't think Kourtney's coming anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The only text I got was: "Mom, got a private plane." I never heard from anybody again, and when I landed, there's nothing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and Scott and Mason are late, and that means Kim is late, too. There just can't be any sort of trip or anything that goes smooth. I'm still surprising them, so don't say that I'm here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was the best surprise I've had in years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KENDALL: There's only so much I do. She's so slimy! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoo-hoo! Join the party! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I feel better. Is Lamar feeling better? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's in Miami right now. Yeah, and it's kind of stressful. Scott called me... the other day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott did? Well, he kinda ticked me off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So how are you and him now? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I just can't figure him out, that's all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's there to figure out? He's a weirdo. I mean, he's just too up and down for me to get invested. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know what you mean. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't like people like that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, he pissed me off. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce is pissed. Bruce doesn't get mad easily. So for Bruce to be venting, I'm kind of afraid for when Scott comes here. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh! In reverse... I got it, I got it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've always told Kendall and Kylie, you have your full life to be old, but you only have a few years to be young. Let's take advantage of the young years and have fun. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Khloe always makes us do crazy and fun things like this, 'cause she's crazy and fun. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kylie... Oh, my God! 313 00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,248 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I knew he didn't catch anything. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, that's a start. I should have started when I was young. But, see, when I was young, Eric, if you were on the golf team, you'd get your ass beat up. I just love golf. I got this guy Eric, who's the local teaching pro at the golf course. Are you a married guy, bring your whole family down here, or what? &gt;&gt; ERIC: No. Single. Having fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Single?! Oh, my God, fun-loving golfer? &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Eric, he's a good-looking guy-- single, golf professional. Also, this guy's got a good fashion sense. My daughter, Kimberly, she's got to find a golfer, I keep telling her. She gets all these strange guys. Eric is not a typical Kim Kardashian date. But it's really time for Kim to date somebody who's kind of normal. Nice! That's why God invented golf-- to get away from the girls. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want it on your face? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God, you are a glitter queen! We gotta think of a tribe name. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Wolf skin rain. That was rainbow and all of our names. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wolf skin rain. &gt;&gt; ALL: Wolf skin rain, wolf skin rain... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: In any tribe, sacrifices must be made. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sacrifice. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Sacrifice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sleeping, minding my own business. The girls wake me up with war paint on. Has my family gone crazy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lay her down. Lay her down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Help me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Get her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Guys, I'm gonnakick your asses. You'd better run for the hills. I've just been thrown into a body of water pretty much naked, and I think I broke my toe because something is really wrong right now. Oh, my God, I think my toe is broken. Hi, everybody. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would just like to congratulate all of you because, on my first night here, I now officially have a broken toe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Why, what'd you do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys broke my toe. I can't even put my shoes on. I'm gonna have to wear flip- flops back on the plane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God forbid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's a nice look. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who broke your toe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're so much stronger than I thought you were. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, that's totally a dream. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you mean you stubbed your toe. It's facing the right direction. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's totally a dream. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ow. Kim, Kourtney, Scott, and Mason are missing, my toe is broken, I'm so sore I can't walk. This is not exactly the way I thought this trip would start out. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really hope Kourtney and Kim and Scott and Mason get here. You know, I came all this way for such a short period of time, and now they're never gonna see me. &gt;&gt; ROB: I can't wait for Scott to get here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who knows if they're even all coming? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney's kind of rude. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's hormonal. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I worked so hard trying to figure this whole thing out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We've got plenty of people to enjoy this place. We don't have to worry about her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm enjoying them? They threw me down two flights of stairs, broke my toe, and threw me in a pool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sounds like a normal day. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you on the plane, Kim? Kim, Kim? Oh, I just got a call from Kim telling me that they finally got to Miami, and now Kourtney's refusing to get on the plane from Miami to the Dominican. It's a little frustrating because I've been waiting forever for the rest of my family to get here. Oh, my God, she's going to go five hours home? Why isn't Scott helping her? Scott's got to step it up and figure out how to be there for her and get to the Dominican Republic. Okay, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, okay. I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll be... Oh, okay, bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: So I'm here now in the Dominican and I have to break the news to the whole family that Kourtney and Scott didn't make it, but I'm just ready to, you know, relax and enjoy this time here with the family. Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Hi. Where is everybody? &gt;&gt; KIM: I came solo. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where is Kourtney and Scott and Mason? &gt;&gt; KIM: She didn't like the plane. It was so annoying. Being pregnant this time has, like, really just changed her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But where is she? &gt;&gt; KIM: She's in Miami. I was just like, I want to just get there. This is ridic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow, so this makes no sense. There's no Kourtney, Scott, or Mason. There's this huge piece of our family missing, and it's a problem. She'd better show up. I can't believe that they're not on that plane. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously, like, this is so crazy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you give him your number? Why would she ever even make contact with Todd? This makes me sick to my stomach. That's a bunch of bull. I lost my appetite. I'm gone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm glad that Khloe made this effort to be here and spend quality time with the family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Girls. Oh, hey. So we're ready to go. Hey, ladies, let's go. We're going to go on the boat. I've decided to soldier on and make sure everybody has a really great day today, so I've got a boat for us all to go out on and have a spectacular time. Okay, I want to have a little chat with you girls, okay? So listen up. I don't like the little attitude that's in the air. I just want everybody to be happy. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She doesn't like the attitude in the air... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...have fun together. All of you together can be kind of toxic. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: She's trying to separate us and talk to us without you. &gt;&gt; SPENCER: So we will go against you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause she thinks I'm the ringleader. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Guys... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am your mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God, this is not me. It's you guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're gonna have to go use the restroom before we leave. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You've already broken body parts. I'm bruised, I'm broken, I'm tired. I just want to start this vacation. Look at my foot. Hopefully we'll get the show on the road. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Off to the boat, yay. Cool, a sailing vessel. I like this. Go, Kim. 446 00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,074 &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce, don't do that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Permission to come aboard, sir. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, would you like a magazine? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My God, look at her toe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's broken. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It hurt that bad when we pushed you in? Whoo! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What are you doing? 453 00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:21,000 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The flying fish. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: One, two, three! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Are there any sharks here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, there are sharks everywhere. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Can I go on the Jet 458 00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:47,927 Ski? Maybe not. No, wait, one last drink. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is a different country. Okay, okay. Oh, Okay. &gt;&gt; MAN: Perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, I think you're too drunk to do this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom is really nuts. I don't think you're supposed to operate vehicles or heavy machinery once you are heavily intoxicated, and this bitch just decides to get on a Jet Ski with her prized possession on the 468 00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:30,369 back-- Kim. Mom, you push the stop thing. Let the dinghy come to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know, that's what happens to the drunk mind. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, tomorrow I want to go-- there's this thing out here called cascading. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I leave tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause I was always leaving tomorrow. You guys came late. &gt;&gt; KIM: We came a day late. That's not my fault. It was Kourtney's fault. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never said it was your fault. &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Khloe is a little annoyed that Kourtney and Scott didn't make it. Khloe's not going to be here for the whole trip, so Kourtney's indecisiveness really is affecting the whole family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She is drunk. 482 00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:13,278 Asleep. Can't wait to see Mason. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, nice couple days of traveling. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We are finally here in the Dominican. It's been such a crazy time to get over here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Bobby. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Here, Mase, come with Mom. Where is everyone? &gt;&gt; ROB: Uh, they're on a boat. I didn't go on it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why didn't you go? &gt;&gt; ROB: Just wasn't feeling good. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, this is nice with everybody gone. So, we're finally here in the Dominican Republic. I'm not that excited to see Bruce, because I've heard that he's been going around talking bad about me. It's pretty immature. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should we go find our rooms? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, let's follow Bob. Wait, don't you want to go have a snack? Let's go have chips and guac. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Guys, I have good news. I just got a text from Kourt, and they finally have officially joined the family vacay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did Mason make it? That's all I want to know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, he did. What's your favorite sandwich, Kendall? Of all time, what's your favorite sandwich? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's trying to bond with you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall, I'm trying to bond with you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. Okay. Everybody gives me flack for not spending any time with anybody, and when I do, this is what happens. 510 00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:52,311 Kim, what's your favorite sandwich? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BOTH: Thank you! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney! We went fishing and we found some treasure! This is our treasure! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Isn't it great? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've been here. you guys... and surprised all you guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Then you can go... I am so shocked that Khloe is here in the Dominican, and I'm so excited to actually spend some time with her. 521 00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,821 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your voice mail was weird. weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom just fell in the pool! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Watch out for the edge. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm trying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's so ridic. I think my mom is definitely drunk already. She's just such a freak. Mom! Stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You literally need to go to, like, the loony bin. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm on vacation just trying to have a good time and relax a little bit, so everybody lighten up. Give me a break! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, it's embarrassing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's up, bruiser? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I haven't seen Scott since he ditched me at the race. I'm still a little frustrated with that, but I think the only way it's going to get better is if he actually apologizes to me for embarrassing me. 537 00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:32,811 All right, I'm going to the golf course. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bro, I love you! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There he is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. How are you? &gt;&gt; ERIC: Hi, Kim. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Eric, the local teaching pro-- he's single. &gt;&gt; ERIC: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, we see a little potential? &gt;&gt; ROB: Don't you, like, want a relationship with him? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why is he talking all 546 00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,469 thisas if I hurt our relationship? Like, we don't have one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'm going to the golf course. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you so unappreciative? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not unappreciative. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to learn how to chill a little bit, and to be... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, no, not only to relax. Just to be not so spoiled. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I thought if anybody was gonna kind of be on my side with the whole Bruce and Scott situation, it would be Kris Jenner. I don't even feel like I disrespected Bruce, but now Kris is telling me I did. It's just very frustrating. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just having fun and appreciating life, not complaining. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, appreciate, but don't be an &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And then he said... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, and he didn't tell Bruce that he was leaving, too. He just left, and then he told this person. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's that now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We were talking about your story about the car thing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh. That's nice. I figured, maybe somebody would be a little sympathetic to the fact that it took me two days, with a pregnant woman and a child, to get here, but no. Kris Jenner tells me I'm spoiled and unappreciative. The girls are already talking bad about me. All I want to do is take a two-day travel trip home. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm so excited. Come on, Kimmy, a little golfing adventure. I can't believe Kim is gonna actually go with me to play golf. And I got this guy Eric I got to play with us, and he's a really good-looking guy and he's single. There he is. He's my golfing partner. How are ya? Good to see ya. My daughter Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; ERIC: Hi, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Golfing virgin. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Really? &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I took a lesson once. It's not really my thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, she's an old hat at it. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. You guys can take that cart. I'll just throw mine on here. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, you live here? &gt;&gt; ERIC: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: And how long have you been here? &gt;&gt; ERIC: I been here a yeah-and-a-half. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh. &gt;&gt; ERIC: There's a lot of things to do: go explore the island. It's pretty fun. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Are these the girl ones? &gt;&gt; ERIC: These are the girl ones. 595 00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:21,980 There you go. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so bad at this. Ah! That's about as far as I can do it. What's the trick to get it up in the air? &gt;&gt; ERIC: When you go back, you... &gt;&gt; KIM: Swing higher? &gt;&gt; ERIC: Try to swing up like this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's good. I like that. Maybe this thing's gonna work out. &gt;&gt; ERIC: Whoa! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, Kimmy! &gt;&gt; KIM: That one was pretty good. &gt;&gt; ERIC: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Right! &gt;&gt; ERIC: We see some 608 00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:50,041 potential. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We see a little potential. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He took off. If it's meant to be, he'll come back to you, you know? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. Daddy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's get some sun, Mase. We got to get a little color Look up. Close your eyes and look up. Yes. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ooh, I am hot. It is so hot right now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So hot. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm just so fat to take my shirt off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There you go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How does that make you feel? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good? I ordered a table-and-chair set for my backyard that was expensive. &gt;&gt; ROB: Really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know what would make you want to spend that kind of money on lawn furniture. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Now I don't know if I should have ordered that or not. &gt;&gt; ROB: So return it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, but I just don't know: should I, or should I keep it? Should I not have ordered that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yo, Ma, you're tripping. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kourtney's super indecisive. And now that she's pregnant, she's a lot more indecisive 'cause she has all these decisions that she needs to make before the baby's born, and I feel like her current mood has definitely made things a lot more difficult for us. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys, should I cancel this order? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Cancel that order! 637 00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:25,937 You don't need a $7,000 outdoor table! That's insane! &gt;&gt; ROB: What's there to do? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's go take a peek. Hello! Dude, I feel like I'm in another world. Rob, go to the top. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is this? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's a bowl. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I hear people. What the? What is this? Dancing with all over again. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's pretty sick. La merengue. Rob, you've gotta perform. Hey, you guys know Rob Dancing with the Stars? Rob, don't be shy. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not dancing down there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You gotta dance, Rob! You were meant to dance! &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I gotta pee. &gt;&gt; ROB: So we were in the car coming to the resort yesterday. Bruce was like, "Scott's so unappreciative. I took him to this race and he, he, he did, like, the first practice run to test out the car and then he left." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, when we were at this track-- 'cause he introduced Brandon and Burt, like, "Oh, these are my sons and my friend Scott." Somebody, like, made a joke to me about it, like, "Where's your acquaintance Bruce?" I was like, "What?" Bruce and I aren't close, so why is he, like, going around, talking all this, like, as if I hurt, like, our relationship? Like, we don't have one. &gt;&gt; ROB: Don't you, like, want a relationship with him 'cause you're kind of like his son-in- law? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I'm not. Kourtney and I have a child together and we're about to have another child together. I would think, at this point, I would fit in with this family, but I don't, and Bruce and I have no real connection. I don't even like that he thinks 672 00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:18,049 he's Mason's grandfather, to be honest, 'cause he's not, and I'll tell him, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did Mom ever meet up with Todd? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I definitely don't think my mom should be in any sort of contact with Todd. And I'm not going to take relationship advice from you, who's going and meeting with people from your past. 679 00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:40,805 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who are you meeting from your past? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, are you sitting next to your girlfriend again? Yeah? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What about her? Is she cute? &gt;&gt; KIM: He is so cool with it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you love her? &gt;&gt; SPENCER: Aw... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce took me golfing today. Did pretty good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Must've been good coaching. Didn't you think he was a nice guy? I saw you just chatting it up. You were chatting it up, Kim. Come on. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ooh... &gt;&gt; KIM: I was being friendly. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You were? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are you serious? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. Normal, nice, single. What's wrong with that? She's gotta open up her mind. You never know where you're gonna find it. You were very nice... &gt;&gt; KIM: I was being nice because he was your friend. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And he's a nice guy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So what's so bad? &gt;&gt; KIM: Bruce, you just don't get it. Like, I am not trying to date anybody. I need to just chill out. I don't want to find anyone. Disinvite him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, Kim. I'll disinvite him. I'm sorry for meddling, getting in your business. But I'd still love to have a good golf professional in the family. That would be actually very good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, unfortunately, I'm done dating athletes, I think. So... maybe for Kendall and 710 00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:10,061 Kylie you can get a nice up-and- coming golfer. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is amazing. Oh, my God. That's, like, the Suez Canal. Hey! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello! arrivederci. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Wow, how did I... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're a little red, Disick. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It'll turn chocolate before you know it, sweet thing. It's unbelievable! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is going on here? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my goodness! Are they dancing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm sitting here at the bar drinking a margarita, waiting for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is amazing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Aren't you proud of me? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Finally, everybody is getting into the trip and having a really good time. We're in paradise, the family's all together. This is an amazing way to celebrate our fabulous vacation. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mason, close your eyes. &gt;&gt; MASON: Oh, yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are they doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, here we go. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah! &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes! Mucha gracia. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go eat. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at how pretty. Is this really a church? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's really pretty. So did Mom ever meet up with Todd? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know, but he e-mailed her again and said he wanted to meet up with her... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Other than the first time? &gt;&gt; KIM: ...to talk. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why would they even talk? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She told me Dallas that she ran into him when she was having tennis lessons. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I heard about that, but why would they talk after that? I definitely don't think my mom should be in any sort of contact with Todd. Especially after the past. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just like, she has unresolved feelings for 25 years. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Right, but I said I don't know if it's going to add fuel to the fire... Like, why would you want to do something... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's the worst idea I've ever even heard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob and I even tried to follow her the other day because she was acting so weird. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I think that there's no good that would ever come from talking to somebody like that. That's just so gross, you guys. I don't understand that. &gt;&gt; MASON: Mommy... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hold my bag. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You should talk to Mom. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, Mase! Hi, buddy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MASON: Water! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Want some water? Here, honey. &gt;&gt; MASON: No! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: He's a big boy, he can feed himself. &gt;&gt; SOMMELIER: Excuse me, sir? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ten children, I've kind of been through this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The last thing I need is Bruce telling me parenting advice. Okay? If he wants to speak to me about the real issues at hand, go right ahead, but if he's gonna keep on going with this, the last thing I want to do is sit next to him. Do you want to switch with me? Seats? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want me to? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't really want to sit at the head of the table. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Be the head of the table. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, well, it's just... there's no one here, and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I wonder about Scott. Does he have any manners whatsoever? I don't know if he just doesn't know how to deal with people. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, don't forget, you guys. Tomorrow's going to be, like, skeet shooting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is skeet shooting? It doesn't sound safe for a pregnant person. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you even know what it is? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but I don't want to do it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why not? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm pregnant. What do you want me to do, zip line through the jungle? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You are the most uncommital person I've ever met in my whole life. I mean, first you can't even commit to where we're going on vacation. First you want to go to Ireland... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've always been like that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And she was late for that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Then you can't... and then she can't even get on the right flight. And the relationship with Scott? It's like, "I can't decide if I'm going to have another baby, and I don't know if I'm going to get married." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who does my mom think she is? She definitely shouldn't be attacking my relationship after what she's been up to. I'm not going to take relationship advice from you, who's going and meeting with people from your past. It's disrespectful to Bruce. 802 00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:30,221 &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who are you meeting from your past? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not meeting anybody from my past. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're not meeting the person who broke up your marriage with my dad? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh... actually, no. That shows how much you know, and how much you've paid attention and you're up to speed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, you met with him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I met with him playing tennis. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did she? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait a minute. You're going to listen to her? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What'd you do, give him your number? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She can't... : Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you give him your number? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She can't decide if she's going to have pasta or-or steak. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Did you give him your... his... your number? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, don't avoid the question. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I am at a loss for words at this point. Why would she ever even make contact with this Todd? This makes me sick to my stomach. Honey, that's a bunch of bull. I lost my appetite. I'm gone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would go, if I was Bruce. And I should go with him. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, really? You're going to go with Bruce? You're gonna take Bruce's side? You don't even know the half of it, Kourtney. You didn't live it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does anyone else want to go? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, I want to go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're really going to leave? Like, for real? Guys, you're making such a big deal out of absolutely nothing that it's like, ridiculous on another level. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't believe that everybody just once again deserts me at dinner. You're gonna all make up your own little scenario in your head, and you won't listen to one thing that I have to say. Which is the truth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God, get over yourself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I never gave him my information, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You said that if and when you were gonna meet with him, that you were going to discuss it with Bruce first. So you're a liar. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KRIS: Life's too short for you to sit around wondering if I saw my ex-boyfriend. Do you want to see? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, book it. I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Is that his thing? Just getting up and leaving? Are you willing to deal with all of this for the rest of your life?
