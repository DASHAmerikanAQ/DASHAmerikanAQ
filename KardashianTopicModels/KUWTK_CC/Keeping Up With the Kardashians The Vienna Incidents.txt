- &gt;&gt; KIM: Mase, please move the table back. &gt;&gt; MASON: I can't eat far away. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, but here-- go like this-- she was here first. So it's gonna stay with her. 'Cause she was here first. And then this is what you're gonna do. No, hey. Hey, she was here first, so it's gonna go there. And then look, look. You're gonna go for a ride. Whee! 'Cause gentlemen always are the nicer ones to the ladies. Do you think using your hands is the best thing? &gt;&gt; MASON: I don't do that, I have my spoon to do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yup. &gt;&gt; MASON: P can say "Kiki." &gt;&gt; KIM: I know, I heard... &gt;&gt; MASON: P, P, come on, say "Kiki" right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kiki. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay, she's not saying the same old thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, I need to ask you a question. Me and Kanye are gonna get married, and I want North to walk down the aisle, but she's too little to walk. So I was thinking of getting a horse and a carriage. But I need you to hold North and make sure she doesn't fall. Do you think you can do that-- maybe you and P? I just need, like, a definite yes, that you'll be able to help me with this. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay, I'll try. &gt;&gt; KIM: Give me a high five. We're doing it. &gt;&gt; MASON: Wa, wa, wa-wa-wa. &gt;&gt; KIM: High five. Will you help with North, too? Yes? Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KIM: Has anyone seen Bruce's hair and why it looked teased yesterday? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, but we should've made him cut it more and now I feel bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: He won't even dare. Who is gonna walk me down the aisle? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me and Khloe. Are you having North in your wedding? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. The chateau is really cool, but it's brand-new. But Kanye is like, what if we get married in an old Parisian church and then have the reception somewhere else? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You don't know where you're getting married yet? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are we gonna wear all white... &gt;&gt; KIM: I think so-- cream, like just a really simple Givenchy dress. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How many times are you changing? &gt;&gt; KIM: Three. Oh, I should have taken a picture of the dress I'm wearing to the Vienna Ball; you would love it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have no idea what this is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom and I and North are gonna go to Vienna to the Vienna Ball. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's so fancy about this ball? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's like a huge opera. So they have, like, one main host every year. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's the host? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: The Vienna Ball is the most prestigious event in Austria. It's this fundraiser; this white tie ball. I'm excited to go. The top is black with, like, sheer cutouts in it. And then the skirt is a huge baby pink satin ball gown. And then in it is, like, that big-- horsehair fabric, almost. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Horsehair. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know what I mean? Like, that-that keeps it, like, hard? It just looks like sheer. Doesn't look like horsehair or anything like that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This has been a very, very interesting visit. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just with Khloe. She's just drunk... ...and annoying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Welcome home, Mase. Who's ready to see their new house? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Go on in. Say, "I'm home, smell you later." &gt;&gt; MASON: I'm home, smell you later. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: After looking for over a year, it was really hard for me to make the decision whether we really wanted to move or not, but I really wanted a bigger backyard for our kids. Look at your backyard; you have all that space to play. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got to see your new pool. It's so big; it's, like, bigger than an ocean. &gt;&gt; MASON: P, let's go play. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's go play, P. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kourtney's probably the most indecisive person I know. Sometimes we end up not even going to dinner, because we go back and forth so many times, where to eat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at your new pool. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So that fact that we've actually made a decision to get a new house is pretty unbelievable. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at your basketball court; you could run all over here. Should we go see your room? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello! Whose new house is this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I haven't sold our current house yet. I'm not moving any furniture yet, so we're gonna be slowly moving in the kitchen and, you know, trying to unpack the bathrooms and things like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's happening, Mase? Good to see you; what do you got, buddy? Is this your new house? &gt;&gt; MASON: I want to show you something. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you want to show me something? Okay, let me see. This is a big backyard. We're gonna have a race. &gt;&gt; MASON: One, two... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Two! Come on, buddy! Come on, I'm coming. Oh, no, you're gonna get me there... Oh, no, no-- oh, you beat me. &gt;&gt; MASON: I did it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good one. &gt;&gt; MASON: Hooray! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hooray! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That is a big backyard. &gt;&gt; MASON: Let's do it again. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, let's not do it again; we're doing fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: So cute, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whatever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? What are the pictures for? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just, like, different Polaroids of our travels. Like, when we took a road trip, like, four hours out of New York. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah, what happened with, like, Kanye, like, went on a rant or something and then TMZ was calling him names? &gt;&gt; KIM: No-- I guess I was, like, walking out of a store or something in New York and TMZ asked, "Do you believe what Kanye said?" And I was like, "Yes, I believe everything he says." And I didn't know what they were talking about, and they were talking about when he was talking about racism. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm. &gt;&gt; KIM: I personally haven't experienced it, you know, firsthand, so it's hard for me to really relate to it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why do you even answer them at all? &gt;&gt; KIM: I usually don't. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, I'm shocked. &gt;&gt; KIM: So it just goes to show, the one time I do... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't we just stay off the Internet? Why don't we have a stay off the Internet day? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't go on the Internet ever, except to look at interior design or kids clothes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When are the moving trucks coming? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um... I was thinking about, like, two weeks, but I'm very anxious about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How is your assistant hunting? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Horrible. I've interviewed, like, 25 people. While I'm in the middle of this huge move, my assistant quit. I hate interviewing new people. I just cannot find the right person. Except that one girl-- did you meet her? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She already made me this list of what my house needs. She was like, "You need a manual for your house with a pool... how to use your pool, how it works, who's the pool man." She was like, "You're going to need somebody who's in charge of the gardener, in charge of this, in charge of..." &gt;&gt; KRIS:That's the kind of girl you want working for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If I was at the old house, I mean, it would be fine. I could figure it out. But it's really overwhelming moving into this new house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I'm for hire. I'm a really good housekeeper. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I'm gonna go home and pack. Toodles. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna use these for my blog and I want, like, only Polaroids, like, rolling down my Tumblr. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Now, don't these... Do these stay for a very long time? Like, you know how back in the day, Polaroids would disappear, like, if you have this picture for ten years? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. Well, I'll tell you in ten years. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Perfect. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh, look, my cups from my motherland. Look at this old thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm extremely overwhelmed with this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: With the kitchen? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: With the entire house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's nothing in here yet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know where to begin... What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like there's not much even in here yet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I just don't know where things go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think we need to make a decision if we're gonna, like, go buy new furniture or not and just start doing that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What do you envision for a table in here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Round, rectangular? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, rectangular. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yello? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. Are you guys... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm very overwhelmed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We've gotten absolutely nowhere. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you overwhelmed? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nothing's happened. Your mom would have already been moved in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but I don't care. It's too overwhelming. I can't be stressed out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think we need her help. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't even stay here without furniture. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's starting to look really junky. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, what... you haven't put anything away yet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What does that even mean... We're extremely, extremely lucky and fortunate to be able to buy a new house, and to me it's just upsetting that Kourtney has to put a damper on things. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, do you have, like, a color scheme? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not yet. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys don't know if you're keeping any furniture or not? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nope. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For reals? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's so many options; I don't just want to pick a dining room table. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is my opinion: this whole house is neutrals. You cannot do what you did to your other house to this house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, when are you guys gonna, like, sleep here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Probably never. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The pink Hermes sarong, monkey pajamas in pink and the Valentino bag. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, are you so excited for Vienna? I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm excited, but, you know, I was just telling Karen that when I've never been some place before, I get confused on how to pack. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? Just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, how cold is it, or... &gt;&gt; KIM: Check the weather on a weather app. It'll be perfect. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why are you packing colorful lingerie? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You never know. &gt;&gt; RICHARD LUGNER: I hope you have a nice day in Vienna tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're here in Vienna, and I love going places and experiencing new things with my kids. I cannot wait to enjoy the culture and taste the cuisine and just see what Vienna has to offer. Your name is on the side of that car, and it says, "Kim Kardashian." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here we are! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so pretty. Kim, this is gorgeous. Wow. It's like a palace. &gt;&gt; BELLHOP: Just letting this here, yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, thank you. &gt;&gt; BELLHOP: Have a pleasant stay in Vienna. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; BELLHOP: Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. Appreciate it. Oh, my God! Kim? They took my favorite sunglasses. My favorite ones! I can barely believe what I'm looking at. They took my gold bag for tomorrow night. Somebody went through my stuff and has actually taken half of it. Look what they did to my suitcases. They ripped... they sliced them. &gt;&gt; KIM: What did they steal? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so angry. The fact that somebody has gone through my suitcase, pored through my things-- I feel really violated. Bet they took my fur throw that Kanye bought me. They took my brand-new gold Bottega bag. They took my black Porsche sunglasses. They took my gold Porsche sunglasses. They took my other Chanel bag! &gt;&gt; KIM: Which one? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The one I bought in Paris when we were there the last time, the little cute one. And my shoes! The matching shoes. I had it on the other day when we were together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I loved that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: They stole all of her stuff. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: They took my Chanel bag. &gt;&gt; KIM: Two Chanel bags, one Bottega bag, her shoes-- her Chanel shoes. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: So they opened the bag? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, but look at... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, look what they did. Look what they did. Come here, you guys. They took everything out of here. They dumped it all in here, and they stole my makeup cases. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wow. Okay, so where is this from-- from New York? &gt;&gt; KRIS: New York on Lufthansa to here; they wouldn't do it while we had a three-and-a-half-hour layover. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, well, the good news is, it's just material things. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's not about the money or the things. It's about the feeling that I was robbed. This feels so awful. I can't even tell you how upsetting this is. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: Well, I'll call them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the...? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you not see the rat? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God! I mean, it's just scary. There's a rat in our house. Does that mean there's rats everywhere? &gt;&gt; MAN: Hi, Kim! Hi, Kim! It's me, Kanye! &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe there's a guy dressed in blackface. &gt;&gt; MAN: I'm bringing you to the center lounge. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, that's, like, not cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did a mini inventory of what is there, but I really have to go through it thoroughly. A lot of stuff is missing. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, I'll go through all the tags. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's five tags. &gt;&gt; MAN: I'll write down the tags. And who do I get in contact with? &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: I will need them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All we can really do over this whole luggage incident is file a police report and try and move on. Thanks for helping to deal with that, Wolfgang. I appreciate it. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN: We'll do our best, and we'll get it done somehow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. Could we get a glass of wine? Really strong glass of red wine. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't quite put my head around this whole situation tonight. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. Pretty crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I don't even... I haven't even... with that... That's just first glance, you know? What they took. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could I have a little more wine? It's been one of those nights. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know my mom is just so upset, and we're in this other country, and I want it to be fun for her. &gt;&gt; WAITER: Famous apple strudel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When in Vienna. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, a little comfort food won't hurt us. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mmm! This is heaven. This is the best thing I've ever had. Voila. That's how you do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney has been talking to this guy. I cannot have meetings that long. They can talk... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What could they possibly be talking about? This house is, like, perfect. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you see the shoes she's wearing? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What shoes does she have on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Birkenstocks. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Birken what? Like, why aren't there seats in this house? Like, that's it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because Kourtney hasn't done anything. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I feel like this is, like, gonna be like this for a long time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott? We have nowhere to sit. I would want to move in so badly. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So does everybody. Most people who buy a mansion would like to live in it. Like, I don't know why we don't want to move in. What the...?! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! Kylie, Kylie, Kylie. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you not see the rat? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Ew! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is so gross. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do we do? We capture it, or we kill it, or what? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ew! Don't touch it! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can suck that right in here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you guys being so loud about? Kenny, you're here? What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's a rat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God! I cannot believe that there's a rat in our brand-new house. Get it outside. Do we have a broom? Rats can carry disease. Does that mean there's rats everywhere? They tend to leave rat droppings. How are we supposed to move here when there's rats? I mean, it's just scary. Okay, I want this rat out of here, and the rat cleaned up, and the corner mopped. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ew! Another one! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Got you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, North. Hey, silly girl. You look so pretty. I feel so blessed that I can travel with my daughter, but it does mean that I'm more on a schedule, because she eats at a certain time, she takes a nap at a certain time, and every moment that I have to be with her, I will be with her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. Hello. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, we see on the... &gt;&gt; KIM: Everyone's writing me saying, "We can't wait for your autograph signing at 2:00 p.m. in Vienna." &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: Oh, they are already waiting. There-there are, like, thousands of people, anyways, waiting for-for you to be there. &gt;&gt; KIM: But no one even told me anything about a signing. I had scheduled my day to where we were done with everything at 1:00 p.m. so that I can go home, feed my daughter, and then put her down for a nap. So, when something like this is sprung on me, it makes it really hard for me to just accept. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is the first we're hearing of it. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I just don't want to false promise all these fans that there's an autograph signing at 2:00, and then I'm not there because I'm supposed to already be gone by then. Before, I would have never done anything to disappoint the fans, or anyone, but now, my daughter becomes my number one priority. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: First, the photo call, and then go over to the... to the, um, mall section and wave to the crowd. &gt;&gt; KIM: Totally. I'll do that. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: That's the only protection that I see, because it was announced. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, so just so you're clear, we'll be there from 1:00 until 1:30. That's it. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, I'm gonna go change. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We just want to get out of the country alive. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: No. Vienna is beautiful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, yeah, but... &gt;&gt; KRIS: It is pretty. The food was good. &gt;&gt; MAN: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just excited to be here in Austria. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: What have you seen and done in Vienna so far, and what is planned? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just getting excited to go to the ball. We have to get ready for the ball tonight. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Could you just say, "Kisses from Vienna"? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, I'm Kim Kardashian. Kisses from Vienna. It is definitely way more difficult to balance my career and being a mom, but everyone does it. I don't want to disappoint anyone. I mean, especially if they came to see me. But you also have to have boundaries. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Welcome to Vienna. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, thank you. Thank you for having us. I love the history, the buildings; everything is gorgeous. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Everyone wants to know, what do you know about the Opera Ball? Will you dance tonight? &gt;&gt; KIM: If anybody knows me, they know that I get so nervous dancing, that I am the worst. So I think I'll just admire everybody tonight and be social. &gt;&gt; EMCEE: Thank you very much. You were very kind. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; GIRL: I love you, Kim. I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my. &gt;&gt; GIRL: Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How amazing is this little setup I made us? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We have furniture all of a sudden? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's temporary, but I just felt like we need to start using the house and actually having a meal here, and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is nice. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...I was hoping this will motivate you to start trying to get some furniture in here so we can start living and enjoying. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's gorgeous furniture. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But you're so indecisive. We need to move in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to rush. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at how beautiful this is. Why would we not be using and enjoying this? I even broke out the fine china. I got to tell you, it is very peaceful up here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just so much more quiet. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doesn't this make you want to get in here sooner though? You're not excited about this house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The thing that you... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're really not excited about this house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm excited. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, you're not. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh, my phone died. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Good, it wasn't meant to be. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There are no plugs here? Here. Ew, doll, there is more rat &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why-why would you bring it... I'm eating! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just showing it to you. It's absolutely disgusting. That means there's another rat here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I would sleep with one rat if I had to, to live in a home like this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're okay with it? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You got to take the good with the bad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, we need to get this problem fixed. We're not staying here until it's resolved. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We got to leave? I highly doubt we have a rat problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I need to go... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's just one littlerat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ugh, I don't even want to go near the bag now. Scott can make all the jokes he wants, but I'm not bringing one more thing into this house until I feel totally comfortable about it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you going home? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going to the other house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, I don't wanna... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't want to stay here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I can't believe how quick Kourtney wants to leave. She's just overreacting. I mean, it's ridiculous. Did you drive here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So did I. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll meet you at the house then. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The garage is where you get a lot of rats. That's where they're gonna find their little way in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was hoping that Bruce would put my mind at ease, but he's just making me feel even worse. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, welcome to the show. &gt;&gt; MAN: This is one of the best moments I ever had. Thank you, Vienna. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: Are you going to dance later? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yeah, we wait for "in Vienna." &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Did he say what I think he just said? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The easiest thing to do is just get, you know, like, six or seven rat traps. Even places like this. They can come up through that. Well, the garage is where you get a lot of rats. Kourt, they get in here. That's where they're gonna find their little way in. All right, and a lot of times, you know, you look underneath here-- they can actually sneak through those little holes. They'll find any little hole. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Kitty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kitty, come here. Come here, Kitty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, what is your new kitty's name? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Christmas Kitty Charlie. You want to go back down? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honestly, that cat is the best thing you can do. And just leave him out in the house all night long. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're, like, the rat professional. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes, I am. So how's everything else coming with the house? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good. I just have no clue what I'm doing. Like, with furniture and... I actually undid Mason's whole closet yesterday. I'm doing P's today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When are you gonna actually move in? Do you know? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. It's so frustrating. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at that. If I was a rat, I wouldn't want to see that cat coming after me. So, what do you actually call the cat? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kitty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kitty? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Usually. Or Christmas. &gt;&gt; KIM: Come in. It's open. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: I'm concerned that we should leave now. At quarter to 9:00, they are closing the carpet for the president. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, let me try my dress on. As if this trip wasn't full of a gazillion surprises, now we're late to the Vienna Ball. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: Ten minutes to 9:00. After the president, nobody can get into the ball. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We got to leave in five minutes. &gt;&gt; KIM: So will you guys just come over to my room? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm taking Cinderella to the ball. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: The princess. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Wow, you look gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, thank you. I hate being late, and I've never been to anything like this. Hi. How are you? And there is so much going on, so many people. I'm getting a little bit of anxiety, and I just kind of want it to go really smooth. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't you think that right there would fit all my long stuff that's in my closet now? &gt;&gt; ROYA: Yeah, but what about... What's happening with the stuff that's in the wardrobes in your cl... in your room? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh,a duck. &gt;&gt; ROYA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where do you put boots in here? &gt;&gt; ROYA: We can try and map out where you want to put everything 'cause it would... it'll be crazy if we bring everything over here and we don't know where we're putting it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can we write that on our list? All right. I'm gonna grab one thing out of my car. Be right back. &gt;&gt; ROYA: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY:Oh, my God. Scott! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There is a rat right at the front door. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the hell do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Come get it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where's Roya? Tell her to box it up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop. It was right here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It was literally right here. Stop. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You don't remember that? It's one of my moves. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's probably 'cause there's a banana peel right here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God. Nobody in this neighborhood's probably ever left a banana peel outside. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not doing this because... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doing what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't stay here if there's rats. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's possibly one little rat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's really just freaking me out because even though I caught the other rat, I had the cat look around the house and there was absolutely no sign of any more rats. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're really getting a little ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm going back to the other house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And what? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not staying here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So you boycott the home? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. I don't want to be here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm getting very sick of Kourtney trying to find any reason not to live in this house. We spent a ton of time and a ton of money to get into this new house; we need to move in. You've got a big problem. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not coming back. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hi, Kim! Hi, Kim! It's me... It's me, Kanye! &gt;&gt; KRIS: A guy in blackface? It's really uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: After this, it's over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I don't care. &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, no photos. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is the Opera Ball. Opera Ball. Vienna. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kim, what are you wearing tonight? &gt;&gt; KIM: Ralph Rucci. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't know what to expect going into this Vienna Ball, but it's everything that I've heard. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: This is a very dear friend of mine, Claudia. &gt;&gt; CLAUDIA: I flew over for this event. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everybody is dressed beautifully. And it's so hard to explain, because it's just really amazing. &gt;&gt; MAN: How do you like it so far? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's amazing. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: Okay, in a moment. &gt;&gt; KIM: There is about 5,000 people here. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: What a wonderful dress. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you. &gt;&gt; MAN: Excuse me. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; KIM: There is a beautiful ballet going on, opera singers, dances. It is super glamorous and super claustrophobic. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hey, Kim! Hi, Kim! It's me. I'm bringing you to the center lounge. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa. &gt;&gt; MAN: It's me, Kanye! &gt;&gt; MAN 2: Oh, my God. Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't believe there's this guy in full blackface. I just am so... confused. I-I don't get why him or anyone else would find this funny. That's, like... not cool. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Think I'll get a drink. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is supposed to be some really nice, upscale event. It's, like, how did this guy get in? This is just like a sick joke. &gt;&gt; MAN: Hi, Kim! It's me! &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, enough with those. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A guy in blackface? It's really uncomfortable, and a little scary. Blackface started in the 1800s, and it was all about white people painting their faces black because African-American people weren't allowed to work. So, actors would dress up in blackface. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: What's a matter with you, boy, shooting up that man's henhouse? &gt;&gt; MAN: I'll shoot any chicken trying to follow me home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But ended up dehumanizing, embarrassing and making fun of certain people. So to have somebody so ignorant come to such a beautiful event and spoil it for everyone is just taking a huge step backwards. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: This is the holding area. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For what? &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: Before the interviews. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't care. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: After this, it's over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I don't care. &gt;&gt; MAN: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Never, in my entire 58 years... &gt;&gt; MAN: You want to drink something? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, I do. &gt;&gt; MAN: Vodka or champagne? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll have a vodka. This is just getting so intense, but Kim still has one last obligation, which is a live interview, and I want to get this taken care of, get it over with, so we can go back to the hotel. &gt;&gt; MIRJAM WEICHSELBRAUN: Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, welcome to the show. Thank you very much for being here. It's a first time for you, um, at the Opera Ball, so what's your impression so far? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's definitely the most gorgeous thing ever. We're really excited to be here. &gt;&gt; OLIVER POCHER: Kim Kardashian here, no? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't understand anything, but I understood "Kim Kardashian." &gt;&gt; OLIVER: Yeah. I told that, because, you know, it was, suddenly, three hours ago, I didn't know that you would go here, and now I am with you here, so... &gt;&gt; MIRJAM: And that's the most beautiful moment in your life. &gt;&gt; OLIVER: This is simply one of the best moments I ever had. Thank you, Vienna. &gt;&gt; MIRJAM: Are you going to dance later? &gt;&gt; OLIVER: Yeah. Yeah, we're going to dance. We'll wait for "in Vienna." &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Did he say what I think he just said? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have never been so disrespected as a woman or a human being in my life. &gt;&gt; KIM: The racial insensitivity-- it's like we're honestly, like, in a time warp. &gt;&gt; OLIVER: This is simply one of the best moments I ever had. &gt;&gt; MIRJAM: Are you going to dance later? &gt;&gt; OLIVER: Yeah. Yeah, we're going to dance. We'll wait for "in Vienna." &gt;&gt; KIM: We're doing a live interview, so I know I heard him right. And my face-- I'm just kind of, like, "Oh, my God. Did he say what I think he just said?" &gt;&gt; OLIVER: "in Vienna." &gt;&gt; KRIS: "in Paris" is actually the title of the song. I get that he's a comedian, but, clearly, that was incredibly inappropriate. &gt;&gt; MIRJAM: Thank you very much for coming, and have a nice time in Vienna. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This whole time, we've had smiles on our faces, and we've tried to be perfect ladies and be very appreciative, but I'm at my limit, and we just need to get the hell out of here. Danke schon. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm mortified. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: Hello, Kris. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is going on? I have never been so disrespected as a woman or a human being in my life. I mean, I come to Vienna, and everything I have that's valuable is stolen out of my suitcase, and this man treats Kim with such disrespect. I've never experienced anything like this in my life. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: Me, neither. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everything has gone wrong on this trip. It's like we're honestly, like, in a time warp. The racial insensitivity-- everything from this trip has just been a true nightmare. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He made me look like a fool. He made Kim look like a fool. That's not cool. That's not what we come from. And my children are taught to treat people with respect. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: It's the craziest situation I saw in my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; WOLFGANG: And I thought, "Wow. What is going on here?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like I've let my children down, my daughter down, by allowing her to even experience this nonsense. Kim and I were really looking forward to having a beautiful night and going to such a glamorous event, and this ball was really beautiful. But it's a shame that the actions of just a few individuals ruined the entire thing for us. &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't think more things could go wrong in Vienna, and then we got on the plane. It was crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This lady stood up... &gt;&gt; KIM: Screaming. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and yelled at the top of her lungs... &gt;&gt; KIM: "Black." &gt;&gt; KRIS: "That baby is black." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott, where are you? What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You need to understand, this is our home. We need to move in. This moving process is difficult, and I think it's time for Kourtney to figure out what she wants, because this is our new home. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean? I'm home. I'm in the backyard relaxing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't see you here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm not at the old house. I'm at the new house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why would you be there? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, 'cause it's a beautiful home, and I moved into it. I'm hoping you'll move in, but if you want to talk to me further, come up here and talk to me like a human in my new home. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We don't have any furniture. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, I got a bed, I got sheets. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What bed? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got a blow up. It's not pretty, but it does the trick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, weirdo. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, it's not... I'm not being weird. I love you. Just come up here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Doll? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mm. You came over? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is your fancy bed? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It ain't bad, but it does the trick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But what are you doing here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's no furniture, there's rats. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's no rats. They're gone. You need to understand, this is our home. We need to move in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine. You want to stay here by yourself? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Doll, I... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is acting like I'm overreacting, but this is my dream home. He thinks it's just one little rat, but it's a big problem to me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just come back with me for tonight. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And then what? You can't let one little obstacle throw you off course and not move into the dream home. One little rat? Big deal. I'll chop that thing up and eat it, make it a stir-fry if I have to, to live here. I know Kourtney very well, and this moving into the house process is difficult. And I know that it's not about this little rat. There's something deeper, and I know she doesn't like change. And I think it's time for Kourtney to figure out what she wants, because this is where we need to be. This is our new home. I just feel like if I don't come and sleep here, you're never gonna get motivated to come here. I'm gonna live here with or without you. This is your dream home. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I'm exhausted. Mom, the baby is sleeping. Do not slam the door. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. How was it? I mean, I heard it was insane. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, the worst trip ever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're a sight for sore eyes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't really know what that means. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That means that we're happy to be here. I missed you. We had the worst trip in the world. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, so tell me. I don't get it. &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't think more things could go wrong in Vienna, and then we got on the plane. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We were on, like, a 12-hour flight, and we couldn't even close our eyes the whole time. We took off from Vienna... &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom had the baby, I fell asleep, I woke up to this woman screaming, "Kanye West's baby?" The woman is screaming at my child, I jump up... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would've punched her in her face. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, we were on a plane. I wanted to. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would've. If you scream at my child, I'll punch you. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was crazy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This lady stood up in the cabin in first class and yelled at the top of her lungs that she's with a black guy and that baby is black. And you need to shut that black baby up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would say, "Hashtag fact, my baby is black. Hashtag, I only like black " That's what I would say. All I get called is a -lover all day long. Who thecares? &gt;&gt; KIM: And then she was like, "And she has a sex video with a black guy. How disgusting. With a black guy." Like, going on and on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was mind-blowing. &gt;&gt; KIM: And then the pilot had to come out and the captain. Like, everyone. They're like, "We're gonna call the LAPD the second we land." And then her husband, like, sat on her and was like, "Shut up. Shut up. You got to shut up." Like, "Shut up. Shut theup." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, we got the hell out of there. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was the trip from hell. It was so racist. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It was shocking. It was like, literally, you thought you were in 1914 or something. &gt;&gt; KIM: It was so weird 'cause Kanye was just talking about it during one of his concerts, just saying how, like, racism exists. During Kanye's concerts, he speaks about racism and experiences that he's seen or been through. &gt;&gt; KANYE: You see there's broke racism. That's that, don't touch anything in the store. Excuse me, that's that, that's that, "Can I help you, sir?" That's that, racial profiling ! racism! &gt;&gt; KIM: And it was really real to him, and he explained how it's still alive. I obviously understood it, but just... it's such a different thing when you experience it yourself. 791 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's a TV. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It looks like it's floating. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Does it tilt? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's tilted. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, but does it tilt back if you want it to? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, but why would you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Just if you want it a little more flush. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, are you overwhelmed by all of this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A little bit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes? Yeah. Moving is really, really tough. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And I just don't like change. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You don't like change? That's even a bigger problem. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You know, we're sleeping here tonight. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're sleeping here tonight? It's so nice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is right. I'm not one who loves change and leaving the memories of my old house, so I've been procrastinating with the move. But I had the exterminator come and thoroughly investigate the entire new house. &gt;&gt; EXTERMINATOR: With the rat, you're okay. One probably just snuck in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Also, I don't really have an option because the people that bought my house did a nine-day escrow. So I'm kind of finally forced to move in. Did you see Mason's room? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, this is so cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna put a little beanbag chair, like, in the corner. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: In the corner? Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's so excited. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good for him. The Mase man gets a new room. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But now I think I'm ready to finally move in, and we can make new memories. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's coming around. Look at this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like P is the only one who's got a real room. She's the new woman of the house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY:I don't think so. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, I like this fabric. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's for one of her dresses. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so beautiful. What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just trying to write this blog. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What blog? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just thinking of writing a blog about, like, our experience in Vienna and just, like, how crazy I think it was and how, like, sickened I am by what goes on in the world. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you feel the need to express yourself, too, it's your... you have a mixed daughter. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I hope she never even has to deal with anything like that, but I would like her to know our history. I mean, like, Kanye's mom and dad were, like, huge activists. And his mom was, like, a person that would do sit-ins and she got arrested. Can I read you some of it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: "I never knew how much being a mom would change me. It's like I get to see the world for the first time again, but through someone else's eyes. It's a beautiful thing, really, to suddenly experience and feel so much more. But with that, the beauty, comes the flip side: seeing through my daughter's eyes the side of life that isn't always so pretty. To be honest, before I had North, I never really gave racism or discrimination much thought. It's a topic that Kanye's really passionate about, but I guess it was easier for me to believe that it was someone else's battle." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you mentioning Vienna or no? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think you need to. I think it speaks for itself. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, let me read you more. "I'm not sure exactly what to do to help, but I feel a responsibility as a mother, a public figure, a human being to do what I can to make sure that not only my child but all children don't have to grow up in a world where they are judged by the color of their skin. The first step I'm taking is to stop pretending like this isn't my issue or my problem because it is-- it's everyone's. And it's our responsibility to speak out for those who can't and hopefully, in the process, ensure that hate is something our children never have to see." &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really good. That's an amazing blog, Kim, and amazing thoughts. &gt;&gt; KIM: Thank you, Mom. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have chills. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I like it, Kim. I like that... I like that you're sharing that side of yourself. Because I think that I wish you did that more often, because it's... you have an amazing, you know, way of looking at the world, and other people would love to hear that from you. Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I need to get a chopper in the backyard. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't get carried away. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Holy Forget about Lord of the Rings-- this is like Lord of the Air. &gt;&gt; KIM: Come on, guys. Can you not keep up with me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, I can keep up with you. Kim and I have decided to do a mud run obstacle course. &gt;&gt; KIM: I really do think that I have a chance to beat Khloe on this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna shove her face in the mud.
