- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah. Who wants some mac and cheese? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was trying to be healthy. I brought a salad. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sorry. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're stepping on my dress. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hungry, fella? There you go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is that green stuff on watermelon? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think it's mint. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Guys, we're going to dish out the juice. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can I have one of your Rice Krispie treats, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, you can. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, do you know how to make anything other than Rice Krispie treats? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, who's ready to spill the beans? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's dish it out, people! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dish it out, people! Come on, Rob. Sit down. We're ready to dish that &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like so much has happened in the past, like, year and a half. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Mom. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, Mom. &gt;&gt; KIM: Seriously? Enough with the phone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I'm waiting for my call to come through. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm the manager. I'm the boss. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a call in 45 minutes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, shut up. It's a holiday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a holiday? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's a Jewish holiday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a Jewish holiday. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe they're not Jewish. &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't think today is a holiday. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, Kim told me it's a holiday. &gt;&gt; KIM: Last week, someone texted me it was a holiday. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's where you get your information? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, well, you guys, I have something that's so hot, someone here might catch on fuego. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, what is it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is it about me and Scott? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't tell you. It could be about anybody on this couch, it could be about me, could be about you. It's just so hot, you guys will be blown out of the water! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Blow me away, baby. Oh, my God. The Kardashians Dish It Out: What are you doing? We have crazy, outrageous footage. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bite it. Harder. Oh, bad chip! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And some stuff never before seen. &gt;&gt; ROB: Theseus, sword. Bunch of! Top up and stop rolling around! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously? That was the best thing ever. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I want to show Mom a few penises. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie, get out of there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're not allowed in here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's huge. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think Bruce might go into a cardiac arrest pretty soon. 57 00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,231 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This started off as a family show. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney and Scott. Ménage à two. Oh, here we go. Baby number three. Scott, you better get some tonight. She's feeling it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: This is, like, once in a lifetime. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like I've learned so much about relationships, in my wise 32 years. I'm just so happy that you genuinely found people that make you really happy. That's all that life is about. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Speaking of relationships, remember when the tabloids had that rumor that you were dating a certain someone, and now it's true? &gt;&gt; KIM: They had a rumor I was dating everyone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kanye West! &gt;&gt; KIM: And it always came true. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you remember when Kim did her song "Jam"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, it's haunting me for the rest of my life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it was, like, the best. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I agree. The video was the best. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, are you ready? Never sung before, and you don't know what you're doing, but, Kim, are you ready? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KANYE: What's happening? Aw. &gt;&gt; KIM: Even better. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He was there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, he was so proud of you. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is seriously so embarrassing; I can't even deal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's so good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, it's kind of weird. If you were doing this, it's, like, it's so normal for you, but it's so out of her box. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't be looking at her ass. &gt;&gt; KANYE: I've never seen it, actually. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: He's totally looking at her ass. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; MAN: Kim is wrapped, 91 00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,493 everybody! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I swear, whatever tabloids say, like, it does come true later. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, but the tabloids have said that you kicked Scott out of the house. So, is that going to come true, or what? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That happens every day. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I might think Scott is annoying at times, but he also has a very sweet, sensitive side. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Does he have a soft side to him? &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott, you definitely have grown into being romantic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Has he? &gt;&gt; KIM: But for sure, it's so bizarre. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, Buggle Bear. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. I look really crazy. I can't look at myself on this, so, look at my boobs. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want a little crotch shot, then? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sure. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott and Kourtney are a rare breed, I would say. They definitely have their own system. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is it! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is what I've been waiting my whole life for. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ow! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh,! &gt;&gt; WOMAN: We're going to come into some Kegel exercises. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You have any exercises? Wait, are you peeing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It feels hot. If you were, it's okay. I would drink your pee just to see where it came from. And I still would. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so I can arrange that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You could? &gt;&gt; ROB: Scott and Kourtney have such an odd relationship, it's confusing. Like, it's just weird. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Show me that chip. Be mad at the chip. Bite it. Harder. Oh, yes! And I'm spent. You did great tonight. Okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was disgusting, okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're a dirty girl, okay? You're a dirty girl. Tell me how dirty you are. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, hey, hey! I don't need it! I'm out of here. I'm taking my pictures with me. I'm going to now paint them. And they're going to be sexual and violent. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. You really are sweet and funny. I like that Scott over there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys are crazy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Promise me that we do not end up like my mom and Bruce one day, sitting far apart from each other. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All you young people have your young problems. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Well, hopefully we don't end up too far apart. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And then there's more 142 00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,255 mature problems down the line. She'll fight over anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey, where's the swan? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where's the swan? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The swan that floats in the pool. The swan. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The big white one? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's dead. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean, it's dead? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was, like, half-full of air. And you said check it, so I checked it... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I checked it this morning. The swan was fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The swan is not fine. It only had a little bit air in it. I filled it up, and it was hardly, like, any air. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I have a patch for the swan. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's gone. No, you can't patch, you can't patch the swan. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We can, we can patch the swan. Okay? The swan is not a dead... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 'Cause it's in the crease. You can't patch it in a crease. You don't know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's the swan, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's gone. It's dead, it's buried. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's my swan! I ordered the swan on the Internet! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fine! You'll go order another one on the Internet. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I don't want to order another swan. That swan was a lot of money. That was a great swan. That was my swan! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, are you really fighting over a swan? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Stop looking at me, swan! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I loved that swan. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Whoa. The my, my, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys fighting are reminding me of Khloe and I, how we bicker back and forth. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You and I could be pretty violent. &gt;&gt; KIM: We could. We love each other... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And we hate each other. &gt;&gt; KIM: And we love each other... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hate each other some more. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are you right now? &gt;&gt; KIM: We love each other. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We love each other now, but you never know what's going to happen in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's true. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim and I have been in a really good place, lately. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like Khloe just thinks I'm, like, high maintenance. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe's definitely not one to hold her tongue. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ever since Kim called me a troll, I love using that word. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so happy you are home. I got you a present. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. She thinks she's so cool. Like she sits on a throne. She's always been that way. She's ruthless. &gt;&gt; KIM: What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're my only friend that I have here. This is very exciting. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was telling my story and you had to chime in and be like, "I work there, too." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She owes me an apology, but I can't get that from her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe definitely always feels attacked. We're fighting over nothing. If I said something that was offensive, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I don't think that way of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: First of all, I'm not going to call her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? Oh, hey, trifling-ass ho. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys are always competitive. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's does little She's just, like, a weird person. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, Khloe's rude to me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim's a bitch. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's really hard to talk to her anyway, 'cause she gets so sensitive. 213 00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:21,401 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That bitch is insane. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ow! I think my butt is bleeding. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not bleeding. That was a big ass right there, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoo, whoo! &gt;&gt; ROB: You guys are showing so much affection. I've never seen it like that in a while. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Isn't it weird? Kourtney is in a lovey-dovey mode today. I like this side of her. Speaking about romance, you got a little heavy romance of your own, huh? Rob, you want to bone my hubby? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, I like women. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Or what about mine? My man. And I've noticed that Scott is always the one who instigates the flirtation. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: You understand me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You want to rub noses like Eskimos? &gt;&gt; ROB: No, but, listen. Just because I'm... listen. 232 00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,897 &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do you want to rub noses like Eskimos? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Oh, oh, oh, oh. Want some, player? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Robert, get in the 236 00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:35,375 shower now! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: All good, baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just come down for the real thing. I know you do stuff like this with Lamar all the time. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but I'm... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're faking it. Can I get in there a little bit? &gt;&gt; ROB: You can get in there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, who knew that you were getting action on both sides. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously, you're a little hussy. You get around. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like such a whore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Geez. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honestly, I think one of the problems we have with this family is, sometimes, everybody's, you know, too close. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We can never be too close. Look, you got chocolate crumbs everywhere. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I was... thought it Khloe dookied in the bed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, that's you. Your candy. So please... &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You know what's so funny, though? I've never ever seen you move your bowels. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, stop. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I'm... being honest. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Boys don't need to know that girls do that. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I do need to know. It would connect us. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you don't. It's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: There's no way you would go when I'm here? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have gone when you're here. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Is that why you call me in the afternoon, and like, "Where you at?" To find out how much time you've got before you do it? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I don't know how you're hiding this. I've been with you every... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not hiding it! &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You are. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not hiding it. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It hurts my feelings a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I swear to you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is appalling. Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's hilarious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was so funny. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think anybody here knows what too close is for comfort. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dude, you taking Lamar to get, um, a colonic is out of this world. &gt;&gt; ROB: I was trying to, like, start fresh or something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. Start fresh. &gt;&gt; ROB: Day one. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Rob, you're going to get your ass aired out today. &gt;&gt; ROB: Do I have rectal problems? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: It's go time. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay, is this your first time? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Okay. Bend your legs. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You got a hairy ass. &gt;&gt; ROB: I do. Sorry. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: It's all right. &gt;&gt; ROB: We're very open, but this is crossing the line. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I mean, the line is definitely crossed somewhere. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: This is what is going into the rectum. &gt;&gt; ROB: That's big. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Approximately there. And through that, the waste will come. &gt;&gt; ROB: You going to hold my hand? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah. I love you, bro. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You look more nervous than he does. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I am nervous. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Go ahead and roll to the side, and I will just put some lubrication around your rectum. And I will take your left-hand side. Get comfortable on this side. And as you breathe out, I'm going to start inserting it into your rectum. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. This is not happening. Oh, my gosh. That was crazy. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: You okay? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You're a real man, bro. &gt;&gt; ROB: I just want to be healthy. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: We've started getting the first couple of dissolved pieces from your rectum. &gt;&gt; ROB: Very interesting, huh? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was sick. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How did everyone like that one? &gt;&gt; ROB: It was the most uncomfortable thing of all time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We catch a lot of naughty things on camera. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, see, that's a lesson right there. &gt;&gt; ROB: He was trying to get me to eat right... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And you guys, we have caught something so naughty on camera that we've never been able to air it before. Which one of you guys do you think it is? &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Naughty? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you even know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know if it's me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I need to wait until the end to show the steamy footage. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know, Scott just had LD put on his shirts? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're doing Lord Disick initials on everything? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. I want to buy some some King of Zimbabwe typeand look like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's wrong with you? We got to leave. We are so cabin fever. This is why I don't come on vacations with you guys. For real. &gt;&gt; ROB: What is she wearing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She looks like Mrs. Roper. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did I do now? Why don't you guys try my soufflé? It's delish. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because it's cold as ice. &gt;&gt; ROB: Where are the drinks? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's actually just out of the oven. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, I love that Vanilla Ice movie. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is probably why Mom and I travel better together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Rob? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop. You guys, no fighting. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa, that's assault. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is supposed to be a day about reminiscing. How many great trips have we been on this year? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cheers. &gt;&gt; KIM: Independent woman. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's just like you. &gt;&gt; ROB: Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you ready? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KIM: My earring's gone. My diamond earring came off in the ocean. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, there's people that are dying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is your suite? &gt;&gt; KIM: God, what if I'm too heavy for him? I feel so bad. Ew, ew! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know that we fight from time to time, but let's have a great last few days on our vacation. &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Pool skinny dip, pool skinny dip... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're grounded. You guys, I'mgoing to kick your asses. We really have had some really good times on vacation. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rock on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hear, hear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I've been on the road for, like, 40 years, traveling by myself. I've got my little carry-on bag, I can move through airports and this and that. Traveling with all you guys, it has become ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like the time when we went to Dubai. That was amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're so cute. Here we go. &gt;&gt; GUARD: We've got to go. It's getting out of control. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, okay. &gt;&gt; GUARD: It's getting out of control. Those guys can't hold it anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm getting scared. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, is it getting dangerous? Marhaba. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Everyone that Kim met in Dubai fell in love with her. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't wait to go back, you guys. Come on, we have to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, you're, like, about to... like, you're salivating over Kim right now. Like, relax. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, here you guys go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Or Scott. You and Rob, you guys came to London. How fun was that? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, yeah, a little place where Lord Disick was, uh, conceived. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know Scott just had LD put on his shirts? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, he didn't. You're doing Lord Disick initials on everything. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah. Can I get one quick photo with you? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yes, you can. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay. Have a great day. I love your outfit. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is exactly what I'm talking about. You don't have to be a queen, a king or a prince. You can just put a royal costume on and people are asking for pictures with you. I want to buy some King of Zimbabwe typeand look like that. I can't believe Lord Disick got us into that hat shop. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh. I've never worn a hat with a veil. &gt;&gt; MILLINER: This is actually horse hair, and it's, it's sort of modernistic, it's not too antique-y. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. Jonathan, what if you tried one? Can a guy wear one, like, to the side? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I don't want to offend him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, come on. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Why do you always have me doing this weird ? This is very awkward. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What's... what's so awkward about it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Come on. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I think you're going dancing around... &gt;&gt; MILLINER: There you go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My friend, no, no, no, I can't... I've got to... &gt;&gt; MILLINER: Yes, you can. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Don't you dare insult him like that. &gt;&gt; MILLINER: Now, just say, "Off with their heads." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I love your head. This is getting weirder and weirder. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was the exact place where Kate Middleton gets her hats made. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How would you even know that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, really? Oh, that's big. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Because she is smart. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I watched the royal wedding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh, that's a little aggressive. &gt;&gt; KIM: That looks like it hurt. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We were in Bora Bora during the royal wedding. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's called TiVo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know I was very indecisive about going to the Dominican, and I know that my indecisiveness caused a lot of tension, but that was, like, the least of the tension. Khloe and Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did I do now? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: We want to leave. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going to go change, and we're going to go on the boat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Change for what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: The boat. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you dressed for? Breakfast? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It... the boat... yes. With the boat... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who dresses for breakfast? What's wrong with you? We've got to leave. We are socabin fever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe, when you're around my kids, please, you know, all the swearing, it just doesn't work. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I... that was Kendall. I didn't swear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It better not have been Kendall. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kendall... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It's not me, Dad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I didn't think so. It was Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's 8:30 in the morning. 9:30 in the morning. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, it's not. Then why did you make us get up this early? You're the one who picked the time, Mom. This is why I don't come on vacations with you guys. For real. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I did was bring everybody to paradise. And this is the thanks I get? &gt;&gt; ROB: What is she wearing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She looks like Mrs. Roper. That outfit was her breakfast outfit. &gt;&gt; ROB: It was the Queen Latifah outfit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't care what was going on. The fact that you looked like that is insane. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That outfit, Mom, was so craze-ful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should never wear that ever again. &gt;&gt; ROB: Ever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can always depend on you guys... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, you were going to cast a spell. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...to give my self-esteem a major boost. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look like a plump little fairy. &gt;&gt; KIM: Speaking of drama on vacation... The time Rob freaked out in the Dominican. I mean, Rob freaks out on every vacay, but... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Every time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What's on that arm? &gt;&gt; MASON: Water... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Can I see it? &gt;&gt; KIM: What is it? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why can't I see? &gt;&gt; ROB: My tattoos will not be seen to you now. I don't give a &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Watch your language. &gt;&gt; ROB: Why don't you just chill out? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kourtney's not doing anything. &gt;&gt; ROB: Kylie, just chill out because you started this whole thing and keep your mouth shut. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: She didn't start anything; we just asked... &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes, she did. Shut theup. Bible. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't say that to me. &gt;&gt; ROB: Then stop continuing this. Talk about politics. Be smart. Don't talk to me about something I'm not going to talk about. Bible, you guys are... you're retarded. Am I in my underwear? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, you're wearing your underwear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's the big deal? It looked like a normal dinner, you know? &gt;&gt; ROB: Don't act like I'm the crazy one. I've done supportive things, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, you have. &gt;&gt; ROB: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: I said, "Yes, you have." &gt;&gt; ROB: I almost went off on you again. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Let me just remind you, there is a moment coming up that is really spicy. Who is it? &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Khloe, remember you being wasted at Kim's wedding? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You were wasted? &gt;&gt; KIM: When? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Please, go inside! I got to go home! Kendall! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was so funny. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think Bruce might go into a cardiac arrest pretty soon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This started off as a family show. We got a 15-year-old sitting here. Young kids are watching this 498 00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,044 stuff. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Excuse. Krispies or brownies? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Krispies. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, how about I do both? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That looks really good, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: Want one? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Of course, she brings hers. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want Krispies? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Fabulous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, I think my favorite day of the last year was probably the day that Oprah came over. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not when Penelope was born? You heartless wench. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Besides those really intimate personal moments, my great, like, day was the Oprah day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Somebody's at the door. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Hi! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi! Oh, my God, it's Oprah! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's Oprah! We thought we would do this, and then we'd all drive to your house in Santa Barbara for dinner. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: You're welcome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that all right? &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Well, I'm-I'm in the middle of renovations right now, so we'd be in the little cottage. I don't think you'd all fit. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The cottage is 10,000 square feet. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Not really, not really. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you remember... &gt;&gt; OPRAH: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, God, here we go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I did your show... I remember, because-- this is how I remember... &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Was it '80s or '90s? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, it was way-- early '80s. You must have had maybe 15, 20 people in the audience. You know, I was on, I think, probably a Wheaties tour. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And in those days, you had to go to every city. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And do the local talk shows. There wasn't a lot of national media. And I remember, the elevator opens up, and you were just walking by. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And you go, "Hi, I'm Oprah. I'm the host of the show." &gt;&gt; OPRAH: I don't remember that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And at that time, I mean, it had to be-- I was, like, on a Wheaties tour, you know, doing talk, you know. We've come a long way. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: We have, we both have. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Karen, take a picture with my phone over there. &gt;&gt; KIM: Just the fact that she was in our home is iconic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Legendary. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think all of us were so nervous. You especially were sweating up a storm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have a problem with my outfit? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I love it. You know, like, when surfers come out of the water and they pull the wet suit down? And they just have the-the bottom hanging? You look totally-- two of you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have no idea how hot that room was. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is my air conditioning. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: So, you're eight months pregnant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nine. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Nine! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Please have it right here. Let that water break right now, I say. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's television. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: That's, that's good television, people. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I remember, I was so nervous for Scott to do the Oprah interview, 'cause you never know how he is going to act. &gt;&gt; SHERI: I am here to help the team figure out what to cut and how we put this together. It's, like, my 17-year anniversary at Harpo. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Jewish? &gt;&gt; SHERI: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Not Jewish? &gt;&gt; SHERI: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was hoping for you on my team, but you win some, you lose some. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One thing that you told the entire world in the Oprah interview is who your favorite child was. Which is no shock, I think, to anybody sitting on... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We've all known. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim and I have been really close, always. And I have a different relationship with each one of my daughters, and I feel like each one is so amazing. &gt;&gt; OPRAH: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But with her, I think that we are kindred souls... &gt;&gt; KIM: That's your word. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't take it so personal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am totally fine. It's just, facts are facts. You think Kim is, like, your pageant child. And you are living your life through her. &gt;&gt; KIM: Everything I get, you get. &gt;&gt; KRIS: These are my shoes, my pants that I got in New York... &gt;&gt; KIM: You literally have stolen my style. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: They're literally the same person. Like, how you guys act... &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, gals. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh, my God. You look exactly like Mom. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello, hello, hello! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-oh, the champagne is flowing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love it when Khloe starts popping champagne bottles. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you old enough to open up a bottle of champagne? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I wish I wasn't. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, Khloe, remember you being wasted at Kim's wedding? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You were wasted? &gt;&gt; KIM: When? &gt;&gt; ROB: Wasted. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Please, go inside! I got to go home! Kendall! Stay inside. Oh, go ahead. Whatever. Are you here to help me? &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, what do you need? 599 00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:30,442 &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where does this go? It won't fit. What a weird bag. That's a stupid bag. We don't need that. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You know, it will get dirty. At least it'll protect it a little bit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Very educational. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You were three sheets to the wind. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's pretty funny. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was amazing. &gt;&gt; ROB: Three sheets to the wind. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, you know what else was amazing? Do you remember the time when you tried to pick me up in Scott's huge monster truck to go shopping in Beverly Hills? And then we got a flat tire. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I swear, you couldn't even see straight out of the car. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whose car is this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott's. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this for real? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't go, like, shopping around Beverly Hills in this car. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you know my sister, Kim Kardashian?! She's in this car! &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, shut up! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's no way I'm fitting into this parking spot. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I mean I think you could. Good. No, you... I literally almost fell out of the car. You're holding up so much traffic. Pull up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know what I'm doing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney, go. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This car needs to move. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it doesn't. Kourtney, you can't-- Kourt, you can't take up two spots. I'm going in. This is so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: Get out. I can do it better than you. Seriously. Come on. You're so embarr-- this is humiliating. There's no cameras to see you back up? Just wait, dude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good job. &gt;&gt; KIM: Am I good? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yep. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're a good driver, Kim. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My goal in picking Kim up in that was to embarrass her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, but you can't even drive it. I don't know how you reach the pedals. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Telephone books. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If you guys think that was embarrassing, try being handcuffed to your husband for hours and hours on end. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How do you pee? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, you have to watch. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Got you now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is this, Lamar? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Because you need to learn your lesson. I'm Khloe's baby, and she doesn't want to let me out of her sight, then bam. Throw the handcuffs on, and I'm not going anywhere. Ladies first. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is very fun. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I got to deuce. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, Lamar. I'm not going in there. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: I got to deuce. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Please. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Come here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. What do you want me to do, sit on your lap? &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Yeah, there we go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You are disgusting. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Come here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stretch your arm out. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Come here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No! I'm not going in there. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Get a whiff of that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar, seriously? This is so sick. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: But I'm-I'm going to need help, though, because I-I use my right hand to wipe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is, honestly, like, way too much. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Nothing like a good deuce. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, that's sick. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a little TMI. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: That is, like, major, major TMI. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe, did you keep the handcuffs? That's the question. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I have furry ones for that type of thing. &gt;&gt; ROB: Now I know why you sage the house all the time. Because of situations like that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Those moments have to be completely erased from your house at all times. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Be gone, evilness. Only positive business ventures in this office. My hubby. Skinny Khloe, come back. &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe. No. No! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've got to sage your pee-pee. &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, no, we're not done. Come on. Lay down. I need to do a ceremony. &gt;&gt; ROB: Khloe, it's so disgusting. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: One... Scoot over. This is what Lamar and I do. Get out of the penis. Do you feel like the STD is out? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't have an STD. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get out of the penis. You will never get a girl pregnant. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, you're weird. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do your ears open? &gt;&gt; ROB: Stop! It's burning me! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Give me your other ear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is going on in your house? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who wants to come over for a good cleansing? Kris, I suggest you come first. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm trying to quit. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, you and Rob really do some freaky stuff together. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like, I would be the one to talk. You... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...do some crazy-ass Maybe you just don't know that I know. mucho caliente! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; ROB: Theseus, sword! Put yourtop up and stop rolling around! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Seriously, that was the best thing ever. You want to talk about kinky, sexy Kardashian fantasy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This started off as a family show. 707 00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,314 I don't want to be involved in a show that talks about sex. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Dish it up, dish it up. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys, we've got to get these brownies away. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Get 'em away from you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, please take them away. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You take them away. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I-I'm taking them away by eating every single one. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wow, you don't stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm, like, addicted to eating. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; CHEF: You just twist. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. &gt;&gt; CHEF: And you just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Squeeze. &gt;&gt; KIM: This looks delish. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you're eating it. You're supposed to be doing it all. &gt;&gt; CHEF: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sacre bleu. You ate it all. 723 00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:38,217 How are you as thin as you are? &gt;&gt; KIM: Mmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The things that you eat, I know why your abs and thighs look the way they do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, our beef ribs aren't in here, and the four orders of cornbread is not in here. Oh, my God. These look so good. I want a roll, too. Hi. Can I get a slice of cheese pizza? Cheers to us. To be honest, I just want to get pregnant so I can eat whatever the hell I want. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It looks like you do that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know I, like, eat a lot, but I'm starving right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who cares if you look as good as you do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We all have our weird habits, don't we? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: If anyone is weird, it's Rob. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, obviously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For sure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Obviously. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Absolutely, out of the whole family, it's Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Theseus, sword! 742 00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:34,139 I'm just kidding.

You can't say "Bible" and then not do it or lie. That's just the rule in the family. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We went fishing and we found some treasure! It's a treasure on another level. &gt;&gt; KIM: The paparazzi in New York City is on another level. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's, like, on another level. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: On another level. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, this is so exciting on another level. &gt;&gt; KIM: On another level. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar's loopiness, it's on another level. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Disturbing on another level. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My little Lam.

I think we were just bored because we were there for so long. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait. Such a fantasy of mine is honestly pulling a prank on the paparazzi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What did you do? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, you weren't there. Kourtney and I did it in New York. You have to see it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The paparazzi in New York is a million times worse than it is in L.A. &gt;&gt; KIM: So Kourtney and I had an idea. We want to sneak out of the hotel and trick the paparazzi. And we wanted to dress you two up as Kourtney and Kim. &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: Who's who? &gt;&gt; KIM: I was thinking, 'cause you have such a big ass... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That you have to be Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have to be me. We're gonna put on wigs, and we're gonna be in totally different disguises. &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: Rob, we're being disguised as Kim and Kourtney. &gt;&gt; CARLA: She's like a blonde Snooki. &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Barf. Who would ever have this kind of a hairstyle? Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What are you doing? This is what you look like as a kid. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Hi, guys. I'm Kourtney. Okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: Hi. I'm Kim Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KIM: Damn! Oh, my God, perfect. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to stuff your boobs. &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: Oh, stuff me. Stuff me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: They were dirty. &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: They're going to say, 885 00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:06,131 "Kim got a bad boob job." &gt;&gt; KIM: Let's go. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, it worked. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, guys. They still don't even know. Gotcha! They don't even know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was classic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who... who thought of that one? You did? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think so. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get it, Keeks. Get it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get it, girl. Get it, pretty girl. &gt;&gt; ROB: Speaking of fantasies, there are some crazy sexual things that our family... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh! Are you... Don't... do not do the sneak peak. &gt;&gt; KIM: Between you two? &gt;&gt; ROB: Between everybody. It's not normal. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's going on? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, don't go... don't go there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Sneaky sexy time? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You have no idea. You want to talk about sneaky, kinky, sexy Kardashian fantasy? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've got a good one up my sleeve, you guys. It's a fireball. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, this better be good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, people can see us? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi! Oh... oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's huge. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Turn the damn thing off. This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm not. No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If we're going to talk about some kinky stuff, I better pour myself another glass. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Get it, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She'll go to sleep early. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whoa! Whoa, what happened there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, you guys ready for this one? It's a little kinky. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, close your eyes. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Hands there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like it when I get to be disciplined. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: You little, bad girl. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, with, like... I don't have a problem talking about sex. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: When I say, "Joe," you say, "No." &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Joe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Here's an inflatable wife. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. The possibilities. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you know what a G spot is? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, boy, do I. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you sure? Bad boy. Bad boy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Who comes up with this stuff? Actually, I'll take one of those whips. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Meow. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Meow. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Meow. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Meow. I'm like a lion. Like, I just want to... you know, lions, all they do is, like... they play rough. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, that's not too romantic. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: Come here! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Stop! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, Bruce.
