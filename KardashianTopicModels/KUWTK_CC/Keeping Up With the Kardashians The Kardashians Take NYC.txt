- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... I'm officially single. &gt;&gt; BRITTANY: Someone wanted to get set up with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? &gt;&gt; BRITTANY: Miles Austin. &gt;&gt; KIM: Then we kissed, and it was just like we vibed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you guys down to do Dash New York? Expanding Dash has always been a dream of ours. I think New York City is the next logical place. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know I'm going to Europe with Lamar. What do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And if I'm the only one who's willing to sacrifice my time, is it even worth it? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll be there for you 90% of the time. 14 00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:33,467 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Your version of 90 is just unacceptable. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my goodness, look at all these people. Oh, you want me? You want me? I'm gonna put you in the basket. Hold the basket up. I want to put him in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott and I put him in a box the other day when we were packing. Wait, Kim, tell me the rest of that story. &gt;&gt; KIM: So he just said, "I'll move on," blah, blah, blah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, who's moving on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can you even carry him? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who's moving on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Reggie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Reggie? Are we back on Reggie? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, he wants to get back together. He just said, "I realize that, like, you're the love of my life, and I want to get back together, and I realize all this stuff," and blah, blah, blah. Reggie and I broke up months ago. And now that I'm trying to move on, I think, you know, it's probably hard for Reggie. It's hard for me. Do I tell him that I've met someone else that's-- and he plays football? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you don't tell him that. &gt;&gt; KIM: He keeps on asking me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have to wait and see where that relationship goes until you tell him that you have one. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I've been talking to Miles for a few weeks now. No one really knows about it. The press doesn't know. And I kind of want to keep it that way. I want to just make sure that I really like him and take things really slow. What do I say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why don't you just say, "If you want to talk to me and be friends, we totally can, but if you're gonna keep asking things like that, you're gonna make it impossible for me to be your friend right now. 48 00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,152 &gt;&gt;

- - -- &gt;&gt; KRIS: How are you guys? &gt;&gt; BROOKE: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How's the music coming? &gt;&gt; DOMINIQUE: Fabulous. We've been recording a lot of new songs that sound amazing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? &gt;&gt; GIRLS: Hi. &gt;&gt; ROB: How's it going? How's it going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my gosh, you guys, I just went to the Lady Gaga concert the other night. &gt;&gt; LAURA: How was it? &gt;&gt; DOMINIQUE: I wanted to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you know who Lady Gaga is, honey? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God, it's the one who, like, looks like-- crazy outfits and really wild shoes and she was at... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I listen to talk radio, honey. So you're from Sydney, huh? &gt;&gt; LAURA: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's cool, I like Sydney. I was there, when was it, 1980. Can't with the Village People. You've heard of the Village People? &gt;&gt; DOMINIQUE: Oh, of course. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, sure you have. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce does this every single time. He always interrupts, and then he turns the whole conversation about the stories from the '80s. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...like, disco was everything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I mean, disco, Bruce? Please! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And by the time we finally got it out, they were blowing up disco records in, uh, Cubs stadium, you know. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, he can talk forever. He's a mo-- he's a speaker. That's what he does. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't get me started. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, just put a little coin in him and... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't get me started. 83 00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,957 &gt;&gt; KRIS: He'll just go until you turn him off. &gt;&gt; MANDY: I wanted to go into Hollywood and maybe dance a little bit. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hollywood? I want to go to Hollywood. &gt;&gt; LAURA: Yay! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You want to go? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. No, I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What do you mean, no? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got an early morning, honey. No, you'll be fine, honey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't be such a stick in the mud. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You don't need to go clubbing tonight. My honey will be coming home with me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... isn't that great? Can't believe you made us come all the way home. Like, party pooper. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm a party pooper? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're a party pooper. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You didn't want to go out with the girls tonight. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 'Cause I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. Don't you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just feel like you've lost your luster for having any social life, and it kind of puts me in a tough spot because you're telling me that I can't go. I wanted to go out with the girls and have a drink. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're not 20 any longer, honey. Why would you want to go out to a club? It's just ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My whole point is that you don't even try. People socialize. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We just socialized. We had dinner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, past 5:00 in the afternoon. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We just had dinner. That's socializing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: When I first met Bruce, we used to do everything 113 00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,633 together. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Baby, there's some local talent. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Local talent? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Local talent, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This, to me, is heaven. He was so adventurous, and we would always try new things. He got me to do everything. Okay, honey, what do you have to say about this vacation so far? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, so far, it's a phenomenal... &gt;&gt; KRIS: But now he doesn't want to do anything anymore. I can barely get him out of the house. I'm starting to miss the old Bruce. You do your socializing your way, and I'll do my socializing my way. And the next time you ever want to even, like, have sex, just give me a call, we could schedule it around 5:00 p.m., before you fall asleep. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How about a nooner? 130 00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,109 &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, that doesn't work with my schedule. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't they have Nutella here? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's Nutella? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Isn't it, like, chocolate, peanut thing? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's hazelnut chocolate cream. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yum. So, Kim, you know your appearance in New York this week-- we should actually stay till the Fourth of July and stay at Loren and JR's house. &gt;&gt; KIM: We should. The Fourth of July in New York City. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Or we should all go. &gt;&gt; KIM: It'll be so much fun. Miles is gonna be there, it's Khloe's birthday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll talk to Scott. I mean, Scott would be, like, dying to go to New York anytime. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, so it's decided. We're going to New York. So, Kourt, about Dash New York-- what do you think it'll take to get you to have, like, a change of heart? 'Cause I really think it's a good opportunity. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Opening a store in New York is, like, a whole new ball game, and just, like, the time commitment required for that. No one seems that they're, like, 100% gung ho. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am. Why doesn't anyone believe me when I say I'm gonna help? I want this store just as much as you; I'm gonna help. I've told Kourtney that I'm in, you know, when it comes to Dash New York; that I'll be there, I'll fully help out with everything. But Kourtney just doesn't trust that I'm gonna be there 100%, so she'd rather just be stubborn and cancel it altogether. I think you're, like, scarred for life, because Khloe left you in Miami. Like, I'm not gonna do that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, it's Daddy. Guess what. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We were just talking, and we think that we should 164 00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,065 really all go to New York for the Fourth of July. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, come on, Bruce, liven up a little. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. I'll think about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You'll think about it? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo-hoo, he'll think about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: So boring. We don't want him anyway. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. No bores. Got to go. Bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: It'll be fun to get out New York. Let's, like, see how we vibe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mason, you want to go to New York? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so hungry. Take-out sushi is never the same. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, it's definitely not. You taste the same all over the world. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm really hungry, so I'm not in the mood. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right, I'll let you eat. Let me know when you want to talk and hang out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't mind talking, I just don't want any... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Any nonsense? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, wait, I forgot to tell you that everyone is going to New York for Fourth of July. And, um, I don't know, I thought maybe we'd want to go. We haven't gone and seen your parents in a long time, they haven't seen Mason. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look at you, just being the friendly mother that I knew you could be. I was born and raised in New York, and I'm especially excited about seeing my family, and not be so close to hers for once. Give me some of that love. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I'm eating. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But I love you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And touching my boob while I'm eating is a double no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So when you're done, I can grab them? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: These boobs belong to Mason right now. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Mywill always belong to you. 199 00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,284 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew. Sick. &gt;&gt; ROB: Look at this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, yeah! Give me my shoes. I ordered those. I need to wear these for Lamar, but with nothing else on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, guys. Are those, like, Loubs or stripper shoes? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stripper-- they're from DSquared. I love them; I just bought them. &gt;&gt; KIM: They're amaze. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, look. Look. "Kim Kardashian has a BF, and he's an NFL baller. Is he hotter than Reggie? You decide. The 29-year-old beauty has swapped the New Orleans running back for the Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Miles Austin, honey. This isn't just revenge, Kim's really fallen for Miles, and the feeling is mutual." How do they know all this? &gt;&gt; KIM: So the news broke everywhere that I'm dating Miles. There's pictures of us everywhere, there's different stories all over the Internet. And Reggie called me right away. I need to call Reggie back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Call him on speakerphone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. 221 00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,151 I don't really know what to say, you know? But, like, were you worried about my feelings when you broke up with me, when you didn't want this anymore? But wait a minute. So-so the whole year that we-- But I have questions. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't want to go with us? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'd much rather just stay here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Loosen up a little bit. You always, like, have a stick up your &gt;&gt; KIM: Tonight, I'm going out with Miles, and I'm looking forward to letting loose. 232 00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,783 Whoo! I'm drunk already! &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. Like, I don't really know what to say, you know? &gt;&gt; REGGIE: Everything happens for a reason. Like, are we going to really go into this? Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. So the whole year that we... but I have questions. The whole year that we were together, that now you want to give it a shot? What about the time... That's inappropriate. Don't... don't treat me like I'm aidiot. Okay? You don't text other whores that, like... "What's up?" still is something. But why would you say "What's up?" unless you had an intention of talking to her and starting a conversation. Okay, look. I don't want to bring up old , but I want you to know that, like, you know, I really love you. Like, I've spent so much of my time with you that, like, there's just all of this resentment right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think the biggest thing right now is for Reggie and Kim both to accept that this relationship is over. They are better off as friends. And I think that will give them strength and be able to move on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. He just said, "Do you? Got to go." Like, there's nothing I can do. I'm happy. That's all that matters. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm trying to find something red, white and blue. This will be cute for the Fourth of July in New York. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wait, wait. You told me that you were going there for Kim's wax thing. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm going for Kim's wax thing, but I'm also... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Then, you're not just going there, coming back? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm staying the whole week with Loren and JR and Kim and Lamar and Khloe. They've invited all of us, including you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But I'm not into that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't want to go with us? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's not me. I'd rather... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Loosen up a little bit. You always, like, have a stick up your I've been married to you for 20 years, and I don't think I've seen you buzzed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you want me to be? Hang out with Scott and drink shots all night long? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I'm just saying, loosen up a little bit and go have fun. We're going to be on the Hudson River on the Fourth of July in the middle of New York City. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't want to go to New York. Um, I'd much rather just, honestly, stay here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, we'll all go to New York, and I'll be wearing this fabulous dress on a yacht, and you can stay here and be bored by yourself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, have a good time. Yeah, it's not my thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: Loren! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Loren! Oh... my... God. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're glamour. I am so excited to be in New York at my best friend Loren's house. Miles is here, so I'm so excited to see him. Great, there's a picture of Reggie and I, and the guy Miles is coming to stay here. Picture of Reggie and I right here for Miles to see! Khloe and Lamar went off to Queens, Kourtney and Scott went off to the Hamptons, and my mom and I are here at Loren's house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is dreamy. Wow. Those are yours? &gt;&gt; LOREN: Yeah. That's one of them. The other one's right there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look, I have the Marilyn Monroe room. And I love that you have the Empire State Building right over your bed. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. Right over your bed! &gt;&gt; JR: Hey! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're in New York! We're in New York! Yay! Whoo! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come on, Mase. Gonna go see your grandparents. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: It's so good to see you. Hey, Masey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mase. &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S DAD: How was the traffic? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was, uh... it was fine. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It wasn't bad. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We hit a little traffic when we stopped at the bagel place. &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: Oh, the famous bagels. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: At Oasis Bagels. &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: Oasis Bagels? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That was it. Hey, Mase boy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mase. &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: Masey, look, look, we put a swimming pool in for you so you can go swimming at Grandma and Grandpa's. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Let's see it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: Has he been to the beach? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He was at the beach in Miami. &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: Oh, in Miami. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We took him, actually, on Father's Day, like, just to the beach and, like, strolled around, but he hasn't ever been really in the ocean. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, Mase. You're being a baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: Next time, you can play with the toys in the sandbox. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's pretty cute, huh, Dad? &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S DAD: Yeah. He's adorable. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hello, Mason. &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: Oh. Oh, he's a... he's a squirmer. You ought to be dancing. Hmm? Like your great-grandma. She was a dancer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott said she was a stripper. &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: She wasn't a stripper! She was a fabulous dancer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's really nice to be here hanging out with Scott's family. Mason never gets to see his other grandparents, so it's really nice for them to spend some actual quality time with them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Want to look at the pictures of when I was a baby? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I want to see if Mason looks like you at all. That's cute-- the sleeping one. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Did I have a cigarette? &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: No. It was something you'd found at the beach. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was cruising one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can tell that Scott's really excited to be here, and I think that we should make a much bigger effort to see Scott's parents a lot more often. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The perpetual man right here. How old was I here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT'S MOM: Oh, maybe four. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, look, nothing's changed in 20 years. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, God. &gt;&gt; ROB: Not bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That was horrible. Takes you longer to warm up when you get older. I used to always be just like ready to go. Now I got to hit balls. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right, well, it's the Fourth of July weekend, so if we're not doing something together, then we got issues. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; ROB: Your wife, she's out of town. She's not going to care. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just kind of ticking me off that she was like... she had this attitude, like, "I don't even want you to go." You know? &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I mean, I feel that you act like you're 80 years old. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't act... I'm out here, I'm 60 years old, and I'm out here smacking balls. &gt;&gt; ROB: She, like, goes out with the girls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, well, she goes out with the girls. That's all she does. Just talk to the girls. I wind up getting stuck in a corner. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I see where she's coming from. She just doesn't want you to just sit around. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob is actually agreeing with Kris, like I'm this old guy. Um, I don't feel like I'm 80 years old. &gt;&gt; ROB: What did you do when you were younger? Did you ever go to, like, clubs or go hang out? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. What are you, 23? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I had already been to one Olympics and was working on getting to my second one and winning it. I never went to a club. &gt;&gt; ROB: You can't really meet girls, but... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I had a blast. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I'm just trying to help you out here. I think we should have, like, a guys' night or something. You know, I know the club scene out here pretty well. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I'm sure you do. I can see you now. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm not... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: "Hey, bros, have a shot!" &gt;&gt; ROB: You're a little grumpy old man. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I'm not a grumpy old man. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, you're not grumpy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm nothing but fun. &gt;&gt; ROB: You just need to experience a little... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You think I need to loosen up? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, a little fun time. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Little loosen up? All right, I'll go out. We'll do it. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hand hug. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, hand hug. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you got to go straight up. Hand hug. 393 00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,654 &gt;&gt; ROB: Kylie teach you that? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I taught them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When they had him, they were so excited. Thank you. What do you get, Loren? &gt;&gt; LOREN: The piatti with the broccoli, and it's delicious. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Could you imagine... &gt;&gt; LOREN: Yes. Do it now. Yes, yes, yes. If you're going to do it, do it now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello? Okay. Wait, you're telling me to have Miles Austin pay for a car wash? Listen. Anything else? You are absolutely loud and clear. I will never, ever confuse the car washer when he thought it was your car. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim and Reggie both get their cars washed at the same car wash place, and they accidentally charged Reggie for Kim's car wash, because they both have the same kind of car. How could a person really be mad about something like a car wash? I think Reggie is mad about something else. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't ever call you again? Okay. He just called and said, "Don't evercharge a car wash "to me again. You can have Miles Austin pay for it." I feel like my past relationship ended months ago, and it is hard when you don't want to hurt someone's feelings, but you're trying to move on. Wow. He keeps on texting me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That validated it. Like, now there's not even an ounce of a question of "Are you doing the right thing?" &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here I am, going out with Rob and his friends. How are you supposed to talk?! Maybe I'm not that much of a fun guy. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't you feel like we could just have a better life here? I guarantee your stores would do better here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, do we have any more messages from Reggie? &gt;&gt; LOREN: Yeah, any more messages? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Reggie has not stopped texting Kim since lunch. &gt;&gt; KIM: "I mean, literally. So glad I didn't buy you a ring. God, what was I even thinking considering that?" &gt;&gt; LOREN: Say, "That's actually what I wished for. That's all I wanted from you. I loved you so much, and all I wanted you to do was buy me a ring, and now, after reading your comments, I'm so glad you didn't." &gt;&gt; KIM: You are right! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love that! Oh, Loren's a genius. &gt;&gt; LOREN: "So glad you didn't. All I ever wanted was, um, to spend the rest of my life with you. I wanted a ring to unite us together forever, but after reading your mean words, I'm so glad that that never happened." &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; LOREN: "You did me a favor. The real you has come out. That's sad. It makes me sad." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LOREN: That's so mature. It's like, "Who are you?" &gt;&gt; KIM: Send it. I'm such a grown-up. &gt;&gt; LOREN: You are such a grown-up! You're so grown-up! You are so grown-up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm such a grown-up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where's Kourtney? 452 00:19:55,795 --> 00:20:00,299 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Khlo. What? What? &gt;&gt; MAKEUP ARTIST: Hi, gorgeous! 456 00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:17,149 &gt;&gt; MAKEUP ARTIST: Hi, gorgeous! &gt;&gt; MILES: Hey, gorgeous! &gt;&gt; KIM: So, Miles comes to the house to get ready before we head out for Khloe's birthday, and it's just really good to see him. Um, I'm so excited for this weekend, and I can't wait to hurry up and finish my hair and makeup so I can get up there. Do you want to go, like, change and stuff and chill? &gt;&gt; MILES: No rush. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll be up soon. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look at the Statue of Liberty. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: These are all things that you're missing out on, being in L.A. Oh, look at the boat. We could take little ferry rides with Mason. Don't you feel like we could just have a better life here? I could almost guarantee your stores would do better here if you opened one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That would keep you busy during the day. You'd have Mason. You could go check on the store. I could go to work in Jersey. But you have to understand. Even Keith made me an offer that I can't resist, and he just said, "Look, the truth is, if you think you're going to run a business from California when we're based out of New Jersey, it's not going to happen. So just think about it. That's all I ask. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, how did you get to school every day? Can you take a subway, or... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Limo. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, you didn't. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: On the Bible, I did take a limo to school. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Once? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: On your birthday? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You took a limo every day? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: For, like, a year, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's ready to party? Hey, Miles. &gt;&gt; MILES: Hey. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How are you? &gt;&gt; MILES: What's up, man? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Our family friends Loren and JR, they are throwing me an amazing birthday party on their yacht. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, Lammy. &gt;&gt; LAMAR: What's up, dude? &gt;&gt; KIM: What's up, dude? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm so excited and I am just ready to have fun. &gt;&gt; LOREN: Happy birthday, Khloe! 497 00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,787 &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER 1: Hey, Kim, who's the new man? &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER 2: You gonna win the Super Bowl? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think Miles is a little weirded out by all the paparazzi and cameras and just all the commotion going on. &gt;&gt; LOREN: Party for Khloe. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know that he obviously knew what he was getting into, but I think that you just don't really know what it's like until you are, like, living it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Miles, this is to ease your paparazzi anxiety. &gt;&gt; MILES: Oh, yeah, exactly. No, cheers. Whoo-hoo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yay. &gt;&gt; KIM: To Khloe's birthday! Khloe's birthday! &gt;&gt; LOREN: Happy birthday, Khloe. 512 00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,935 Here's to Khloe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Happy birthday, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Robert, the party guy is here! &gt;&gt; JJ: There he is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There they are. &gt;&gt; JESSE: Hey, Bruiser. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Getting started. &gt;&gt; JESSE: I can't believe you're actually here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How you doing? Here I am, going out with Rob and his friends, a bunch of 20-year-olds. &gt;&gt; JJ: You excited about this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know what? I've lived in L.A. for 34 years, and I've never been to a club. What are you doing, playing with your earring here? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How many carats you got in that thing? &gt;&gt; ROB: 13-karat gold. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 13-karat gold? &gt;&gt; ROB: Why don't you get a earring? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. &gt;&gt; ROB: Let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Maybe this will be good for me, the L.A. club scene. 532 00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,877 Party time. We are out of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. He gets... He's, like, a little overwhelmed. Like, I don't think... Yeah. Yeah. The cool thing about Miles is that he's really kind of gotten me to loosen up a little bit. I never drank. Everyone would call me "so boring." I swear, that tastes like water. Are you for real? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Can I get a few more? I want to bring them upstairs. &gt;&gt; MAN: You want the whole thing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll be right back. Oh, yeah. Oh, &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Okay, have another vodka, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am sorry! I was trying to be cute and carry the whole tray out and it wasn't cute. &gt;&gt; LOREN: Did you drink the vodka, or are you passing the vodka? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes, I had a shot. I'm drunk already! 554 00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:39,912 &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel really good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoa... Oh! Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, please don't embarrass me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; KIM: Whoo! Whoo! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! Whoo! &gt;&gt; ROB: So, you know the BG5 girls? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I like them. &gt;&gt; ROB: I invited them out tonight. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They're going to be there? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No way. I like those girls. &gt;&gt; ROB: Do you know what they call me, like, in Hollywood, like, in the club scene? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I don't know. What do they call you, Rob? I'm afraid to ask. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm afraid to say it. They call me "Young Slay." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: "Young Slay?" &gt;&gt; ROB: "Young Slay." &gt;&gt; JESSE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; JJ: I heard it was "Little Wiener." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I thought it was "Very 576 00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,784 Little Wiener." ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. &gt;&gt; VALET: Good to see you, brother. How you doing? How are you? &gt;&gt; JJ: Yeah! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a whole 'nother world down here, huh? &gt;&gt; MAN: Bruce! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! What's happening, guy? What's happening? Hey, hey, hey. Let these people in. Follow me, guys. &gt;&gt; JJ: Do it. He's been here before. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 1: Rob Kardashian. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, good. Hey. &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: What's up? 590 00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:23,582 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Rob Kardashian. Oh, my poor little boy. How are you supposed to talk? This place is packed down here. There are people everywhere, and it's so loud, I can't hear anybody talk or what they're saying. &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm not, you know, too excited about this. I'm not into the big party and then drinking and all that kind of stuff. I mean, it's just not me. that much of a fun guy. Yeah. Wait, wait, hold it. Maybe I should just suck it up and be a little bit more social. It's time to get busy. ♫ ♫ Getting a little bit loose partying with the BG5 girls. This is good stuff. ♫ ♫ I'm kinda having a good time doing this. ♫ ♫ Hey, hey, I'm in L.A. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hold my hand. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, thanks, Rob. Now, do you get one earring or two earrings? &gt;&gt; MAN: What is Kris gonna think of this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It'll be interesting to see her response. &gt;&gt; LOREN: Best wish ever! Whoo! &gt;&gt; KIM: I can tell Miles is way more relaxed now, and I'm having a really good time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo! I love New York! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can't hear. You're gonna have to talk up. &gt;&gt; ROB: What up? &gt;&gt; MAN: We're gonna get Bruce earplugs for next week. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Diamonds and earplugs, that's exactly what I need right now. Body piercing. I've always thought about, you know, pierced ears. I see a lot of guys have that. And I got the opportunity. Let's go for it. &gt;&gt; MAN: What is Kris gonna think of this? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It'll be interesting to see her response. &gt;&gt; ROB: Hold my hand. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, hold your hand? Thanks, Rob. I'll be fine. &gt;&gt; MAN: That's what I did when he was getting his tattoos. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have you had this done before? You guys ready? &gt;&gt; ROB: I think I am. How does it feel? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It isn't that bad at all. Now, do you get one earring or two earrings? Rob, the second one. &gt;&gt; MAN: Here we go. One, two, three, four. &gt;&gt; MAN: I am never getting my ears pierced. &gt;&gt; ROB: It actually doesn't look bad. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's the new Bruce. &gt;&gt; ROB: You did it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I never thought this would happen. ♫ ♫ All right. Actually, I was surprised. That didn't hurt at all. &gt;&gt; ROB: I want to go masturbate. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What the hell are you talking about? &gt;&gt; MAN: What you talkin' 'bout, Willis? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What the hell you talkin' about? Does anybody know where there's a 24-hour something open? 643 00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,233 &gt;&gt; ROB: There's a Carl's Jr. Get off here. Those crisp burritos sound pretty good. With the Western Bacon $6.00, 647 00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:11,109 it looks really big, huh? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; ROB: You're a gentleman. You're what I wish I was. I'm so drunk right now! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Have a good night. &gt;&gt; MAN: Rob, did you get fries? &gt;&gt; ROB: Give me some. &gt;&gt; MAN: Here you go. Here you go, idiot. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Enough spilling! It's my car! Rob, give me some. &gt;&gt; MAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch it! Watch yourself, watch yourself. Whoa, whoa, whoa. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Home is sweet home. &gt;&gt; MAN: Are you and Jesse sharing a bed, Bruce? Bruce, are you already taking the shoes off? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I want sleep. &gt;&gt; MAN: See ya, Bob. &gt;&gt; ROB: We gotta say his prayers. &gt;&gt; MAN: Good night, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All I know is my ears are still ringing from that place. &gt;&gt; ROB: Do you want water or anything? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I want sleep. &gt;&gt; ROB: Well, I'm gonna shut some of these lights off. Oh, my gosh, I think I broke my jaw. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: I love you, too. I'm not even kidding. Love you, too. 670 00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:23,548 &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go to bed, Rob. &gt;&gt; ROB: Sorry. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: How fun would that be if you guys lived out here? I will baby-sit. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, okay, he'll grow up, like, "Yo, papa! Papa! I want the bottle, Papi!" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Miley's with Lamar-- "The paparazzi's just, like, weird for me." &gt;&gt; KIM: He doesn't have to be comfortable with the paparazzi, 678 00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,768 but I hope he doesn't let it ruin our relationship. &gt;&gt; LOREN: Oh, my God, everything's just so cute on you. 682 00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:59,484 Yo, Barbie. I can't believe it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Last night with Miles was amazing. We had so much fun. 686 00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:10,762 It was honestly like the perfect night. &gt;&gt; LOREN: Okay. &gt;&gt; LOREN: I love that. Even if it gets a little rough when it gets intimate, I love that. &gt;&gt; KIM: I swear I think I have a bump on my head. &gt;&gt; LOREN: Oh, my God. 693 00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:48,366 &gt;&gt; KRIS: From the sex? &gt;&gt; LOREN: Exactly. &gt;&gt; ROB: What the heck are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, good morning. So, did you have fun last night? &gt;&gt; ROB: I had fun. I mean, did you have fun? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, I did. It was fun. I had a good time. What do you think? The earrings look good today? &gt;&gt; ROB: I honestly think Mom's... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know pain. &gt;&gt; ROB: Mom's gonna kill you, to be honest. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Think so? &gt;&gt; ROB: But that's just my opinion. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your mom always is saying, "Oh, you gotta dress this way, you gotta be cool." Or, "You gotta be hip. Or, "You gotta get your hair cut." &gt;&gt; ROB: She just wants you to be like a, you know, like a modern-day athlete. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A modern-day guy. &gt;&gt; ROB: Athlete. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: She's coming home today. Maybe I should get a haircut. Should I go that far? &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, she might go into cardiac arrest. &gt;&gt; ROB: You never will cut your hair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go for the haircut. &gt;&gt; ROB: And then when we're done with that, should stop by the tattoo shop. You should get a tattoo. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I don't think we'll go for the tattoo. A little earring can come out. &gt;&gt; ROB: Brad Pitt cut his hair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Really? &gt;&gt; ROB: And he's got tattoos all over. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Got tattoos all over? I'm no Brad Pitt, all right? 722 00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,507 &gt;&gt; ROB: Perfecto. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Perfecto. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Adrienne. Adrienne is Rob's ex-girlfriend, and she moved to New York. Her and I were really, really close when her and Rob were dating. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How long have you been back in New York now, two years? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: No, it's only been a year. Doesn't it seem like it's been a really long time? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, obviously you would see her a lot more if she opened her store in Soho. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Yo, if you open a store in Soho area, I will baby-sit. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah, okay, he'll grow up, like, "Yo, papa! Papa! I want the bottle, Papi!" &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I'll be, like, "Papi, what's the beef, Papi?" &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That would be hysterical. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would love it. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: But come on. How fun would that be if you guys lived out here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Kim's already offered to help her, and my parents are in New York. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: I think you should do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Yes. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't you listen to your friend here? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Your man's job is in Jersey. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your man! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But my job... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is everywhere! &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: ...is gonna be here 'cause you're putting a Dash here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys could go stroll around during the day, eat lunch. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: You can be my stylist again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Perfect! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We can share shoes again, even our clothes. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Yes! All of our clothes since you decide when you want to not look like you had a baby. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What else did you share? &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Panties. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Pantyhose. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Vibrators? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ADRIENNE: Sometimes on 758 00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:20,018 the weekend. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We were so drunk, you were dancing around the island. I was slothed. Like, I'm just, like, I'm dead right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you look gorgeous for being dead. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I tell you something that Miley said to Lamar? Miley's with Lamar, like, "This is just, like, weird for me this whole thing." He said something like, "The paparazzi, it's like I don't really understand it." He goes, "Well, this is just what happens when you're with these girls." &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's tough. There was, like, literally a hundred paparazzi and people following us. I just need to make sure that, like, you don't want to repeat the same problems over again. I need someone that's comfortable with the craziness. 775 00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:09,834 I need someone that understands it and is okay with it. I just hope Miles is comf... Like, he doesn't have to be comfortable with the paparazzi, 779 00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:23,048 but I hope he doesn't let it ruin our relationship. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Be kind. Be gentle. Aren't you done? You just keep going around. &gt;&gt; ALEX: Don't push on me now. &gt;&gt; ROB: Let him do his thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's gone. It's all gone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's wrong? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Miles and I broke up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, here we go. &gt;&gt; ROB: Are you nervous? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A little bit. But I know I gotta do it. &gt;&gt; ROB: I'm proud of you, buddy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you, thank you. I knew you'd be proud of me. I'm going to get my hair cut with Alex Roldan the butcher. Kris's hairstylist for the last 25-30 years. Um, I don't know what to expect, but here it goes. So what can we do? &gt;&gt; ALEX: Well, we're gonna bring you out of the bad '70s... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ALEX: ...and maybe bring you into somewhere in this century. What do you say? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're doing it. &gt;&gt; ALEX: Come on. Let's go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. Wash? &gt;&gt; ALEX: Wash. To the bowls, my friend to the bowls. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wash! All right! Let's go for a wash! I like the wash treatment. All right. Oh, you're ready for me? &gt;&gt; ALEX: I'm ready for you, but you're ready for me? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just don't go crazy. Be kind. Be gentle. &gt;&gt; ALEX: All right, here we go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; ALEX: Let's start this, all right, buddy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't go crazy. &gt;&gt; ALEX: Look at this, geez. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're having so much fun, aren't you? &gt;&gt; ALEX: Look, right now we're about into '83. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Aren't you done? You just keep going around. &gt;&gt; ALEX: Don't push on me now. &gt;&gt; ROB: Let him do his thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Change is good, right? &gt;&gt; ALEX: Very good. In this case, necessary. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, when Mom comes home, we should go and surprise her. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, we will. She'll be shocked. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's gone. It's long gone. baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: New York has been so incredible, and I've really enjoyed spending time with all my girls, but I really miss Bruce, and I can't wait to get home to him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Miles, I mean, I don't think he would ever have dreamed that there would be, like, all that paparazzi, all those people. Like, that was mayhem, you know what I mean? I was just like, "Oh, God, I "hope he at least doesn't, like, freak out." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey! Are you back?! &gt;&gt; KRIS: We're back...! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yay...! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I missed you, honey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How was the trip? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We had so much fun. Kendall had a blast. I mean, you've got to come on these trips with us because you missed out on so many great times. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You really did. It was so much fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I miss you. Rob and I, we've been having a good time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You have? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. Love you, too, babe. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How much fun was that, you guys? &gt;&gt; KIM: That was honestly, like, the best weekend. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hope Miles had a good time with all of us. We're not the easiest people to handle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have everything? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All right, let's go. I'll see ya later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye! Oh! What are you doing? Bruce! Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you have everything? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: All right, let's go. I'll see ya later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bye. Oh! What are you doing? Oh... my... God! Honey, what are you doing here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I came to drive you home. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What did you do to your hair? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: It looks so good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Are you sure? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah! Oh, my God, are those diamond earrings? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It was all Robbie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look how cute your hair looks. It looks really good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It looks really good. &gt;&gt; KIM: My gosh, I like it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, Rob, yeah. Same brothers. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. You even smell good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. See, Rob, we went with the earrings, a little bling. &gt;&gt; KIM: He looks so good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got a lot to tell ya. We went out, but yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What happened? What do you mean, you had a good time? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, we got a lot to talk about, but we did go clubbing. Anyway, we'll talk about it later. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You went clubbing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everything's fine. I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We've been asking you to go clubbing for 20 years. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. I went clubbing. And you know what? It wasn't bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: Honestly, Bruce, it looks amazing. You look like young and hip. It looks so much better, seriously. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Young and hip. Okay, good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love Bruce's new haircut. And I can see that he's really, really trying, and it makes me happy that he wants to be more adventurous now and get out there. And I'm really looking forward to hanging out with the new and improved and adventurous Bruce Jenner. I gotta go away more often. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know. Next time we go together. All right, come on. Let's get in the car. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It looks so good. Doesn't it look good, Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whoo-hoo. Oh, my God. Who knew? We went away, and Bruce was 80. 886 00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:06,297 We come back and Bruce is sexy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like it space out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's not how it should go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How should it go? What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Miles and I broke up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bible? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, Miles and I broke up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Kimmy. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, the last thing I wanted to do was, like, you know? I know that, like, everything happens the way it's supposed supposed to. We just came from such different worlds, and he, like, didn't understand my world. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If Miles is using this as an excuse: "I don't want to date her due to paparazzi"? Bye. I know that Kim is upset because Miles has a really big issue with the whole media attention. This is better that she found this out now because then she can't get as hurt if this happens six months from now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just hate that I even gave it a shot with him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right, but you wouldn't know that it's not meant to be if you didn't give it a shot with him. &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to get away. Get my mind off of everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait. Bible. Wasn't Kim us when we first opened Miami? We were single needing to go have a new start. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. You need to get out of L.A. for real. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Debbie Desperado. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so ready for a fresh start. I just need a whole new beginning. I need something that I can just dive into again, and that'll be Dash, New York. I feel like this is the perfect time to go to New York, open up a store, get my mind off of everything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're the one who didn't want to go to New York, and I'm the one who was, like, dying to go and get this store done. &gt;&gt; KIM: Come on, Kourtney, please, please open Dash with me! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm the one who wants to do the store. &gt;&gt; KIM: Please, I need it! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're the one who doesn't. I just need some attention and some help. &gt;&gt; KIM: I have nothing else going on in my life. I need to get away. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Maybe, just maybe I was a little bit too hard on you, and we can do Dash. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're gonna be so jealous. We're gonna iChat you and we're gonna be wrestling, rolling around. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never said I wasn't gonna be jealous. I am the biggest jelly belly of life. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can come visit. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I am so excited that Kim and Kourtney are going to New York to open up a third store, and a little sad that it's gonna be Kourtney and Kim. They're gonna be having all this fun together, and I'm gonna be in L.A. listening to it all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's gonna miss Khloe? Me. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're such a bore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You married whore. You're such a bore. You married whore. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you guys being mean? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause you're going to be so jealous when we're in New York. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, I'm really not gonna miss this when you guys are in New York. &gt;&gt; KIM: Stay home with you husband. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And we'll be in York. &gt;&gt; KIM: We're going to New York! We're going to New York! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who's gonna miss Khloe? Who's gonna miss Khloe? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Fine. I will miss you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I will! I will! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop! This is not gonna work. You just cling on to her foot. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, we're done. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, we're done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And the boring whore wins again!
