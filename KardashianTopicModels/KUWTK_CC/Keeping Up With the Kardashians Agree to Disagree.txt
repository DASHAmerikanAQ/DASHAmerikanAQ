- ♫ &gt;&gt; GIRL: Can I get your signature? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, of course. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, Kimmy's here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Robert. Nice shirt. Can we get a separate plate? &gt;&gt; WAITER: Yeah, I'll get some extra plates. &gt;&gt; ROB: It is so much fun watching you guys eat the food. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We are such a fat family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When I was at the coffee place the other day... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...the Sheriff's Department in Calabasas-- four of 'em are sitting there-- and I said to you guys, "Okay, should I buy a gun?" And all four of 'em in unison said yes. There's a lot of wacko people in the world, and that's why I think I should have a gun in the house to protect myself and my family. We've already had the SWAT team to our house because somebody made a prank phone call saying that there was a shooting out of the house and the guy was in the closet. I never have owned a gun, never bought a gun in my life, but the other day we had heavily armed police officers in our house. That was ridiculous, honey. I mean, how many weirdoes does this family attract? I think that's even a better reason to make sure that I get a gun in the house. If that were to happen and that nut is still out there, I want to protect myself and my family. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're gonna... kill them? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, if somebody comes into my house with a gun, yeah, I'm gonna blow his ass away. Yeah, absolutely. You should have a gun, Kim, and you should have it in your house. &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't like guns. I would never want a gun in my own home. It's really scary to me. I don't believe in them. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, the only thing that would persuade you is if you're looking down the barrel of a gun and you go, "Damn, I wish I had a gun." &gt;&gt; KIM: And if it does, my last words will be, "Bruce was right." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Can we put that on your tombstone? "Bruce was right again." &gt;&gt; DR. JOCHEN: All right, Khloe, you ready? I'm gonna move your neck just a little bit right there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hmm? &gt;&gt; DR. JOCHEN: And you're just gonna feel a little pop. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think I can do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, it's not like a bikini wax, where it hurts. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I would rather get a bikini wax. &gt;&gt; DR. JOCHEN: Hold her hand. There you go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think I can. &gt;&gt; DR. JOCHEN: I'm gonna stretch you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, &gt;&gt; KIM: ♫ Ah... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, &gt;&gt; DR. JOCHEN: You're all done. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's the craziest thing ever. &gt;&gt; DR. JOCHEN: I am so proud of you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna take this. It's my attorney. Hi, how are you? But why? I was supposed to be deposed, like, in December. This is, like, the fourth time they've pushed it back. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Don't tell me they're pushing back your divorce. &gt;&gt; KIM: My deposition. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. I constantly feel bad for Kim 'cause she's nervous to have a baby, she doesn't have a house ready and she doesn't really know what to do or where she's going. And now Kim's divorce depositions have been pushed back again. This could only be so stressful. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right, guys, I got to go. I just have a meeting regarding, you know, my deposition and the trial and everything coming up. Aren't I lucky? Stress, stress, stress, all the way around the board. They want to push back my deposition. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? She's only getting more and more pregnant. And now to have to deal with all this extra stress and BS, it's not healthy, it's not good for her, when she's still, like, stressed out about so many other things. You're pregnant, for God's sakes. Like, get it over with. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, so-so when does that mean? June or July. Great, I'm gonna be, like, nine months pregnant. Okay. So just let me know whenever. I will be available anytime, anywhere. I'll fly anywhere. I don't care. I just really want to get this done. My divorce has definitely been dragging on for a while now, and Kanye and I want it to be done by the time the baby's here 'cause I really don't want to be married while I give birth to our baby. Thank you for filling me in. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; ROB: You need to make sure that's done within two months. 92 00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,314 &gt;&gt; KIM: Rob, I've been trying to for over a year and a half. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mwah. These are cute glasses. Did Kourtney buy those for you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Scott did. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Those are cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm so cool, baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you are. Thank you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, this is why I ordered you here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We had a wacko swat us, saying that there was a gunman in the house and called the police. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How long did it take for the police to get there? Seven, eight, nine, ten minutes? You want to have protection in the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's nobody gonna have guns in my house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I'm taking a complete safety course, but I also want Kendall and Kylie to take the class. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They will be. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-mm. It's not necessary. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey... &gt;&gt; KRIS: They're 15 and 17 years old, okay? My 15-year-old is not going to gun school. I do not want Kendall and Kylie... No. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The chance is one in a million that it's going to happen, but if it does, I want to be ready. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A gun is not gonna be in my house ever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It is my responsibility to protect my family. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. &gt;&gt; LEAH: How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You probably know how to paintball. &gt;&gt; LEAH: I don't. Never done this before. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know it's gonna hurt. I'm not nervous though. I probably will be nervous when, like, we're out there. &gt;&gt; STAFF MEMBER: Let's go play paintball, guys. Let's go! This is elimination. First team to knock out the other team takes the field, guys. Three, two, paintball! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, go! Kendall, get in there! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Go, go, go, Ed! Go, go, go, Ed! &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Don't shoot me! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Brandon's over here! &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Go, Kendall! &gt;&gt; BRODY: You're out of there. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh! Got me! &gt;&gt; BRODY: Red team! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Brody got me right in the head. That hurt. Lift my head up, boom! It grazed right off my head, and I went, "Oh, yeah, you got me on that one." &gt;&gt; LEAH: Well, I think we should play again. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah, let's go. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Let's do this. Right now, I'm trying to build a relationship with my father. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay, go. Heads up, heads up. &gt;&gt; BRODY: This is the first time in my life I've ever really started to have a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How the hell did he get behind me? &gt;&gt; BRODY: And it feels good. That's game! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We got to go again. See, even these guns. Guns are good, right? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, Kris is, like, dead set against me getting a gun for the house. I just... I got to stand up to her on this one. I think it's important. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I do believe in home protection. I treat guns with the utmost respect, and I see where Bruce is coming from. You know, he wants to protect the family. For home protection, absolutely. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. 161 00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,422 Back me up on this, Bro. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I will. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, Bobert. What's popping, man? &gt;&gt; ROB: Hey, uh, do you stuff your? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Do I stuff what? &gt;&gt; ROB: Do you stuff your pants? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No. &gt;&gt; ROB: All right. Um, just looks like you do. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Get off my, Scott Disick. You see this guy? He's got a big old shotty next to his bed. &gt;&gt; ROB: Oh, yeah. Brody has, like, crazy amounts of guns. Like, Bible. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Really? &gt;&gt; ROB: I legit want to buy a Glock, though. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: A 19? &gt;&gt; ROB: I don't even know the different sizes, but I want a Glock. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just feel, like, you know... obviously it's good to have a gun to protect yourself, but you never know whose hands it could get into, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But then, hey, for safety reasons, you should lock your gun up and put it in a safe so a kid couldn't take it. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah, but you're not gonna want to run from your bed, out of the house... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, I'm just saying if I'm in here. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But in my... in the house, there's ones you could put at your bedside table with a safe. Now Rob has kind of got me thinking I should probably have a gun, too. But I have a lot of people in my house, including little children, so it needs to be somewhere safe or it can't really be here at all. Let's go look around my house, and I... we'll see if there's any good hiding spots. Maybe I keep it under here, you know what I'm saying? I feel like this is a fine place-- we just put a piece here. 'Cause it's, like, midway... &gt;&gt; ROB: But the bedroom is... You have the kids in the bed. Not happening. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: But in all honesty, if there was a gun in the house, like, it scares me about her getting ahold of it. Like, she gets pissed. Like, real deal. Like, I could see her, like, just grabbing the piece, cocking back and being like, "You're" &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. You're right. You should put it under your &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Where you going? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Down. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How do you feel about guns in the house? 207 00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,107 &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not good. Who knows what you would do? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim said she needs to go to the hospital. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. She's going to the hospital? Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She called me and said she's having really bad pains. She feels like she's going into early labor. She said, "Help me," and I said, "I'm in New York, so I can't do anything, but let me call Mom and I'll have Mom go pick you up." That's when I called you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim's on this flight that just landed, and she's in excruciating pain. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, what's wrong? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'll call you when I get off the plane. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are-are you going... Do you want me to meet you at the hospital? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What hospital? Cedars? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, just Paul's. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Paul's. All right, I-I'm on my way. As Kim's mom, I'm panicked and don't know what's going on. I got to go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where you going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: To the hospital. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Do you want me to go with you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. Let me deal with her and find out what's going on. It's sensitive. I have so much anxiety over Kim being ill, especially because she's pregnant. I'm just scared. &gt;&gt; KIM: I was literally crying the whole flight. It hurt so badly. I could hardly walk. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so sorry. This is absolutely shocking and scary. &gt;&gt; KIM: It hurts so 238 00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,597 bad. It hurt so badly. I could hardly walk. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm so sorry. Kim has always had a really strong tolerance to pain, and she's not a complainer, so this is absolutely shocking and scary. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want it to stop. It hurts so bad. Like, just to breathe, to do anything, it kills. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're gonna be okay. &gt;&gt; PAUL: So, you're in a lot of pain, huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Let's just take a look. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Oh, that kills. &gt;&gt; PAUL: That hurts? &gt;&gt; KIM: I... It feels like I'm in labor. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Could you see if we have a, um... a heartbeat? &gt;&gt; PAUL: Yeah, let's do that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, she's having sort of a troublesome pregnancy, having all sorts of pains and whatnot, so I'm just scared that something's gonna go so wrong. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why is this happening to me? I hate it... so much. : I hate it. It hurts when I cry. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, don't cry. Don't cry. It's gonna be okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: I, like, could never do this again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sorry. I wish I could do something. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, this is so painful. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Here's the baby. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's the heartbeat? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Thank God. Thank you, God. &gt;&gt; PAUL: The baby looks fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh! Relief. Relief. I want that volume to be as loud as possible so we could hear that baby's heartbeat loud and clear. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Here's what we're gonna do: I'm gonna have her come in, draw your blood. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; PAUL: We want to check for urine, make sure you don't have a urinary infection. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; PAUL: I'll get that organized. I'll be back in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; KIM: Do you want to turn the light on so she can take my blood? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm honestly just so relieved that the baby's okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want me to call Kanye? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, it's Kris. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Oh, how's it going? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. We just saw the baby's heartbeat. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: So the baby's fine. This pain is just so unbelievable. But I'm hooked up to a machine right now. It's, like, seeing if I'm having contractions. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your girl's gonna be just fine. Both of your girls. &gt;&gt; KANYE: Okay, great. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, bye, babe. I'll call you when I get home. &gt;&gt; KANYE: All right, I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; PAUL: Okay, you're not having any contractions. So you do have a little fever. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; PAUL: I'm almost certain this is not a surgical condition, but I'm doing some blood tests, so if those blood tests are normal, I wouldn't worry about it very much. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; PAUL: I want you to go home, take a couple of these pain pills, go to bed, and then call first thing in the morning for the blood test. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Come on. For her to be in this much pain, it scares me so much. I just want her to be okay. I mean, I want her to relish in this pregnancy. It's the most amazing experience, and I feel like she's not having it yet. &gt;&gt; CARLA: You okay...? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is, like, worse than anything I've ever felt before. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Did you eat yet? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, she hasn't eaten. Your drugs are on the way, and I think the minute that we get some medication in you, you're gonna feel a million times better. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Gotta take care of yourself. No working. &gt;&gt; KIM: If labor is worse than this, I'll hang myself. I'll literally take a knife and slit my throat. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Don't say that. &gt;&gt; KIM: It is absolutely gut-wrenching because I don't know what's really wrong with Kim and the baby. My greatest fear is that something's gonna happen to one of them. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just in so 320 00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:53,615 much pain. The worst pain of my life. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's cool if I just shoot like that? &gt;&gt; HINES: Let's not around, man. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think Scott's a complete &gt;&gt; MAN: Do we want to call it for today? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't give a 327 00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:09,063 -- whatever you want. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay, put the gun down. &gt;&gt; PAUL: This could be an appendicitis. &gt;&gt; KIM: Getting appendicitis while pregnant is not fun. &gt;&gt; PAUL: It has potential complications for the pregnancy. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's gonna be really tough to go through. ♫ &gt;&gt; ROB: Kourt, I'm coming in. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How's your diet? &gt;&gt; ROB: It's just unrealistic. I get, like, two snacks a day. Anyways... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should we call Kim and see how she feels? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. I feel bad. I haven't... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you talked to her? &gt;&gt; ROB: No. I mean, I did a little bit. &gt;&gt; CARLA: This is Carla. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Is she asleep? &gt;&gt; CARLA: Yeah, she's sleeping. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, we'll let her sleep. How is she feeling? &gt;&gt; CARLA: Uh, she's, like, in a lot of pain, but she took, like, a pain medication at, like, 5:00, so she passed out. Ugh, so scary. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't believe she's in so much pain. I never had anything like that. &gt;&gt; CARLA: I know, that's, like, what everyone's saying, and I'm, like, ugh. I don't know why she feels this way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll see you guys, um, soon. Maybe we'll come by after our shoot tomorrow. &gt;&gt; CARLA: All right, cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; CARLA: Bye. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You're not supposed to be stressed when you're pregnant. 357 00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,034 It's bad for your body and for the baby. &gt;&gt; BASIL STEPHENS: Are you excited about today? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; STEPHENS: We're ready to give you... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...teach me everything I need to know? &gt;&gt; STEPHENS: Everything you need to know about firearms safety. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Everything. Safety. &gt;&gt; STEPHENS: Right. There you go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You got it. Especially with at lot of the wackos out there, I think I should have a gun to protect my family. So it's time to take my safety course in guns. Rob and I are doing everything we should to be a good, responsible gun owner. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL HINES: What we hope to do today is get through the handgun safely certificate course, and then we're gonna look at some modern firearms. They do make firearms that are double action only... ...and where every round... &gt;&gt; ROB: Turn it off. &gt;&gt; HINES: ...has to be double action to pull... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm in gun... I'm in gun school. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why are you in gun school? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 'Cause I'm getting a gun. Okay, I gotta go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, you're not getting a gun. No gun! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This woman could make a thousand phone calls to me. There's a gun going in the house. &gt;&gt; HINES: When my daughter was coming up and when I felt that she was ready to be able to safely handle a handgun, we went out to the range, just to learn how to do it, and it's really important to have kids aware of it, just so they don't have that fear. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; HINES: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's really important for me to make sure Kendall and Kylie knows how to operate a gun, and knows how to operate it safely. Because there's gonna be a gun in the house. I want these girls to be responsible. &gt;&gt; STEPHENS: All right, do you feel qualified now to shoot, Bruce? 395 00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:06,261 You ready? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm ready. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh... &gt;&gt; CRANE: All right, let's take your temperature first. Just let that sit in your mouth there for a couple minutes. The thing that kind of got me anxious is your blood count. This could be an appendicitis. We really don't want to operate on a pregnant woman. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Because it has potential complications for the pregnancy. If we really feel strongly that this could be an appendicitis... then, sometimes, we have to operate. &gt;&gt; KIM: Getting appendicitis while pregnant is not fun. It's not easy. It's gonna be really tough to go through. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Show me where you think the pain's the worst. All throughout there? &gt;&gt; KIM: Even a little hurt... &gt;&gt; CRANE: That hurt more, didn't it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, so much. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Let's see if I can see anything that looks like an appendix. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. That kills. &gt;&gt; CRANE: You know where the appendix is at this stage? It's right about here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, that kills... &gt;&gt; CRANE: How about this side? &gt;&gt; KIM: Ah, really bad. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Okay. That's pretty serious. Here's what I'd like you to do. Give us another urine specimen, and let her draw your blood. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Paul... &gt;&gt; CRANE: Then we'll figure it out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The last 24 hours have been beyond stressful. I just want to hear the doctor say, "Everything's gonna be fine." &gt;&gt; CRANE: I don't think this is appendicitis. I could be wrong. She just doesn't seem quite that sick today, so I'm pretty happy. I'm more worried that it's some, um, infectious process. So go home to bed... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; CRANE: We'll see how things go. And we're gonna get this blood test back tonight. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; CRANE: Let's hope it's better than yesterday. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; CRANE: All right, I'll call you when this blood test comes through. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, brother. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hey. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You ready to go do this? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I made it to the gun range, and I really wanted Kendall and Kylie to be here. Kylie didn't want to, but Kendall made it. The problem with Kylie is that she's got her mom in her ear. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm so excited. I've never shot a gun before. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, well, we're 444 00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,165 gonna do it today. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay, let's go. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I heard that it's Rob's first time using a firearm, so I'm kind of excited to see how he does. You know, it's kind of an experience to shoot a gun for the first time. &gt;&gt; HINES: Whenever we're shooting, we want to make sure that the gun matches the ammunition. If you go shooting with friends, you might end up starting to mix and match, and that could cause a real safety issue. There's a, uh, an isosceles... or the FBI stance, which is... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, my patience... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I know, right? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...is so crazy. Look, I'm ready to have about a heart attack. &gt;&gt; ROB: Shut up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's shoot it! &gt;&gt; HINES: The range is now hot. We are hot. Eyes, ear protection for everyone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ooh.... &gt;&gt; STEPHENS: Load and make ready. &gt;&gt; ROB: This is my first time shooting a gun, so I'm really glad I'm with the professionals, rather than me just trying to do this by myself. &gt;&gt; STEPHENS: Do it! &gt;&gt; STEPHENS: Cease fire! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you got one dead shot. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Like, to think that people could be on the other side of these things really freaks me out. &gt;&gt; HINES: You two gonna come up and, uh... do some shooting? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Switch sides. &gt;&gt; ROB: Yep. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: It just, like, freaks me out that, like, people are, like, killed with these things. I don't... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, but there's... Yeah. Well, the thing is, we don't want you to be killed by one. We want you to be... comfortable around a gun. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Thinking about how guns kill people, it really, actually scares me. But then... I'm kind of happy my dad brought me here to learn about them, just 'cause if there's gonna be a gun in the house, I'd rather be educated. &gt;&gt; STEPHENS: Front! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh-ho! &gt;&gt; STEPHENS: There you go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Oh! &gt;&gt; STEPHENS: Keep it... you gotta keep it downrange. Okay. Go again. All right. You're gonna hear a click. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; STEPHENS: Okay? Once it clicks... you're gonna bring it up... Now, let me see your grip there. &gt;&gt; HINES: What you're gonna do... yeah, this is excellent. Keep that up, and then bring your other hand up to support. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, it's cool if I just shoot like that? &gt;&gt; HINES: Then you're gone. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; HINES: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It was only a joke. &gt;&gt; HINES: Let's not around, man. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I got you. &gt;&gt; HINES: Are we gonna have a problem? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, but like, chill. I mean, w-what's the big deal? &gt;&gt; HINES: The big deal is gun safety. Go on, go ahead, do what you want, whatever... Do you want me to hold it? &gt;&gt; HINES: Yeah, I'd like you to... just as I instructed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I heard you. &gt;&gt; HINES: Do we want to call it for today? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't give a -- whatever you want. &gt;&gt; HINES: Okay, put the gun down. Here, we'll go off the lot. Okay? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. &gt;&gt; ROB: I think Scott's a complete He shouldn't wave the gun around like... it's nothing, when in this situation, it's obviously a serious issue and safety is the number one concern. He deserves to be kicked off the gun range. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Where's Scott? &gt;&gt; HINES: He and I had a disagreement as to what would be safe on the range, and I asked him to leave. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: There's no reason to be throwing a gun around, whether it's loaded or unloaded. You just don't do those types of things. 516 00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:25,179 When you handle a gun, you have to be extremely responsible. &gt;&gt; KIM: The divorce petition that we filed, his team have filed a motion to deny it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What a bunch of horse &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just so sad over this whole situation. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall came out to the gun range for a safety course. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They don't need to know how to operate a gun. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're being very 526 00:23:48,503 --> 00:23:50,872 one-sided. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys lied to me. ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you up? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I'm upstairs, just reading e-mails. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you feeling any better? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm so tired. The anxiety that I have is so ridiculous. We did a second round of test results, and it came back that I don't have appendicitis, I just have a little infection in my stomach. So I'm on antibiotics, the pain is starting to go away... I just feel so relieved that I don't have to have surgery. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, I think that you should just, you know, relax as much as you can control. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll give you a nice little massage. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're so not nice like this. What's going on? I'm so glad that Kourtney came over. I have so much going on in my life that I just wouldn't even know how to really relax and just take care of myself, so I'm glad that everyone's really stepped up to pitch in and take care of me. Yeah, this feels really good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I feel like you've got to sit like this all the time, with your legs up... &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...and just relax and watch movies. 'Cause let me tell you, honey, the days of laying in bed and watching movies is about to come to an end. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't tell me that. 554 00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,674 I literally cry at the thought of that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to help me cook? I'm making some canned goods. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God, did you turn this on? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Not... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What the? Who keeps anal beads in the stove? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my gosh. I forgot we put these in here. We were gonna scare you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, wait! This is for Scott-- an anal douche. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: "Comfortable, easy to use, simple to clean." Simple to clean? It's gonna haveall over it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ew! Stop! I'm gonna tell everyone that you put that on their food. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You think anyone's gonna eat your food? Look, you know I almost got shot at the gun range today. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Shot by who? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: One of the gun rangers. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Bruce wanted me to come to this gun range, and I'm just trying to do my thing. One of the gun rangers was all over me. I made one little joke. I was like, "Is it cool if I hold the gun sideways?" He was like, "Do we have a problem? Do we have... a problem?" And I was like, "Look, man, no disrespect, like..." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And Rob was fine? Did he get into a fight with anyone? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob and I initially were both like, let's both just get some guns, we'll have 'em around the house... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, I'm not gonna tell Rob that he, like, can't have a gun. Like, he scares me. If I get into a fight with him... I'll just, like, lock myself in another room or whatever. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Rob should not have a gun. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But I wouldn't 588 00:26:35,754 --> 00:26:37,489 really want you to have a gun around me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: After that experience, it really turned my off about having a gun in the house 592 00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:47,031 because you never know who's gonna have one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just wanted to check on how Kim's appointments were. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I took her to the doctor, and I just feel like she's, you know, needs to get some rest. She's having a baby and she's got to move. She's going through a divorce. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She has a a lot of issues. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The fact is Kim is pregnant, Kim wanted a divorce long before she got pregnant, and Kim really does deserve just to put this behind her. I just wonder if she could speed up the process and, like, talk to her attorney. There has to be another way to do this. I mean, we just... &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I'm gonna go check on her in a little while, and I'll let you know how she's doing unless you talk to her first. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, love you. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Love you, too, honey. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What's up? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, what's happening, buddy? I'm glad you went to the shooting range. I'm really upset that Kylie didn't go. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I don't think we should talk about this so loud, 'cause Mom is in the house. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: If we're gonna have a gun in the house, we got to be safe about it. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Dad, Father... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey. What's happening, babe? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Nothing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall came out to the gun range for a safety course. And... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall came out to the gun range? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a safety class on how to operate a gun the safe way. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They don't need to know how to operate a gun, okay? Like I said, they're not trying Charlie's Angels. They don't need... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is unnecessary. Who cares? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not-- I don't want you to... you don't need to touch something that kills somebody. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Maybe I want to be a Charlie's Angel. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It most cases, it's Kris's way or the highway. But in this case, as far as keeping a gun in the house, she's absolutely wrong. She doesn't know what she's talking about... and a gun's going in the house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I'm not in the middle of this. I don't want you yelling at me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know, but I... Whether you knew it or not, I asked him not to take you there. When your parents don't agree, then there has to be a compromise. It's not go behind somebody's back and do what the other parent doesn't want. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You're being very one-sided. He... You have an opinion... &gt;&gt; BOTH: ...and so does he... &gt;&gt; KENDALL: And you said it's about compromise, so... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, but so we have to meet in the middle and this isn't the middle. This is sneaky and you guys lied to me. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's only for safety, Kris. You got to start getting smart. Don't work on emotions. Work on facts. On things that are real. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: My dad is the man of the house and he has his instincts to protect the family, so... I don't know. I think she should just accept it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, the gun is put away safely. It's locked up, it's put away. There's safety measures here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good, so when a guy comes to blow your head off, how are you gonna go get your gun in your secret place? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You watch how I... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And I don't appreciate you getting Kendall to go to the shooting range and shoot a weapon behind my back. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Grow up, Kris. Grow up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's never gonna be guns in this house. No way. &gt;&gt; KIM: I woke up last night in the middle of 3:00 a.m. with the sharpest pain in my stomach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My heart seriously breaks for Kim. Like, all she's ever wanted was to be pregnant and enjoy this pregnancy, and I think this is definitely not the picture she painted for herself. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It's 8:23. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, I got to go. The judge set a trial date. 670 00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:09,133 And that has forced the deposition date today. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Ooh. Where are we hitting them, Brandon? Golf's no fun without a competition. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: The stick. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Oh, we're going for stick? Not bad. Okay, you've been practicing this, haven't you? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Is Dad really gonna get a gun? &gt;&gt; BRODY: I mean, he's been talking about it a lot lately. 680 00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:44,352 I was thinking about getting another one, too, actually. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'm not necessarily against guns, you know, like, for safety, and also for if you're out in the woods. Dude, if you live out in the middle of nowhere, it's, like, a gun is a part of life. It's a way of life out there, but bringing them into, like, cities, you know? &gt;&gt; BRODY: Yeah, but you... I mean, there's a lot of home invasions and things that happen. &gt;&gt; BRAND: I don't think there's a lot. I think that you hear about them, and it also depends on where you get your news from. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Uh, well, do you not remember the house right next door here that got robbed? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: And you know what they took? &gt;&gt; BRODY: What? &gt;&gt; BRANDON: A gun. The gun didn't help the robbery at all. And yet, now some criminal has a gun. I'm not so sure about my dad needing to buy a gun. There's a lot of other ways to protect the family. You know, there's a big debate going on right now about gun control, and a lot of people are really divided. &gt;&gt; BRODY: I do think that it is kind of a weird time to be buying... &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Guns right now? &gt;&gt; BRODY: It's bad timing, yeah. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: It's bad timing. &gt;&gt; BRODY: Words of wisdom by Brandon. You're-you're so good at that all the time. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: I'm gonna make a tape. &gt;&gt; BRODY: You are, you know what-- yes. If you'd like to talk about... &gt;&gt; BOTH: ... gun control... &gt;&gt; BRODY: skip to track 14. &gt;&gt; BRANDON: Go to track 14. &gt;&gt; KIM: Look it. This guy in Vegas handed me this-- how nice. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Aw, infant diapers. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wonder if they're itchy. Will you wear one for me and see? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, what's going on with the emergency divorce? &gt;&gt; KIM: I basically, like, wrote a letter that just says, "I am requesting this trial date before, you know, the baby comes, and they've stalled, like, three or four times. So if we... the trial they said should only take, I mean, like, three days tops. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Have you still been having those, uh, painful feelings in your side? &gt;&gt; KIM: I woke up last night in the middle of 3:00 a.m. with the sharpest pain in my stomach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm. My heart seriously breaks for Kim. Like, all she's ever wanted was to be pregnant and enjoy this pregnancy, and I think this is definitely not the picture she painted for herself. &gt;&gt; KIM: Every once in a while. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What did the doctor say? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, he just says I need to relax and he thinks it's good that I'm working out and being active. Just don't, like, be stressed. Stress is his main thing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What, this is your nutritious lunch? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Tuna and crackers-- it's nutritious. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, okay. Uh... this is what we're gonna do. Kendall went to the shooting range, learned how to use the gun. I want you... No, hold on, hold on, hold on. You got to know how to load it and operate it safely. And that's what's important, and that's what you're gonna learn how to do. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm not doing it. I hope you know. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why not? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom is the one that's saying we don't have to, so therefore it's not an issue. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Your mother is not the law, okay? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm talking to Mom. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You don't need to talk to Mom. You need to listen to me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He really wants me to learn how to use a gun and I'm not down to. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He's making you feel like life isn't safe. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm chilling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like the world is a bad place. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm straight cruising. You need to go tell Dad. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I've talked to him 150 times. Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is not a political battlefield. You cannot manipulate somebody into believing the same things you do. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It doesn't have anything, it doesn't have anything to do with belief. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, you did this to me when you first met me. You try to make people believe what you believe. Everyone has their own opinion. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm gonna put it in a lockbox... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not gonna... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...that only the four of us know how to get in, so nobody else can get at it. It's very safe-- it's made specifically for the gun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Now, that's the bottom line; it's going to happen. I'm winning on this one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You can yell and scream all you want. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's it gonna live? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm winning. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where's it living? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Probably in our room somewhere, I'm gonna... Because it's got to the... to something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: They'll just open the box and take the gun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: They can't, they don't know the combination. Only us four will know the combination, and he can't get it out, so it'll be extraordinarily safe. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: How about only the people... how about only the people that want to use the gun know the combination? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kendall, she's rational, okay? She actually came up with a compromise that I think, maybe, we all can live with. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Knowing you guys have access to a gun is so scary. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're all... you're insane. Kylie, Kylie, we're leaving. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is not a game or a joke or a toy, this is not. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Exactly. No, it's not. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is to protect the family. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: You won't know where it is, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...I'm not having a gun at my house. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Neither will Kylie, so chill out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Chill out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: The two of you... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I win. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...can go play G.I. Joe all by yourselves 'cause we're not playing. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Goll, all this over just protecting the family. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. What's all this stuff flying around in the air? &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what I'm looking at. I think they're pussy willows. Uh, have you ever seen pussy willows? It's, like, snowing pussy willows. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, don't say that one more time. You sound really stupid. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, it is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, I think I got a pussy willow in my eye. I swear. Have you looked online today? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. What's up? &gt;&gt; KIM: The divorce petition that we filed, his team, like, filed a motion to deny it. His team isn't ready. They still haven't gotten all their information together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who's not ready? What a bunch of horse &gt;&gt; KIM: Honestly, it's just dragged on, like, so much now. And I just, I can't stress about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't have a choice. 809 00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:30,364 It's going to stress you theout. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just so bothered and so just, like, sad over this whole situation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's not a lot that Kim can do. She's going to have to just accept the fact that this is beyond her control. The most important thing she can focus on right now is her health and her baby. I don't want you to be sad, Kimmy. That makes me sad. This should be the happiest time 819 00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:59,494 in your life, what you're going through right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just wanted to call and wish you good luck on your depo. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wonder if he's gonna be there today. I'm anxious to see Kris. I hope that maybe this will give him and I some understanding. 826 00:37:12,807 --> 00:37:15,610 Like, I've never had to get like this. ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How you doing? I'm Bruce. &gt;&gt; SEAN: Good. I'm Sean. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Sean? Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SEAN: Nice to meet you, too. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm at the gun store to pick up the gun. Very excited about this. Kris and I? Well, we kind of just decided to disagree with each other, but we're moving forward anyway. So I'm basically looking for something that's, you know, for home use. When I took the safety course, I shot that nine-millimeter Glock. &gt;&gt; SEAN: I got a few nine-millimeter Glocks available here. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And do you have safety boxes? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yes. It's electronic safety boxes. Basically, child-safety proof. Opens up. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We have to get something like that? &gt;&gt; MAN: Yes. &gt;&gt; ROB: Sorry. I wake up at 5:00 to work out, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, you did? Really? &gt;&gt; ROB: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SEAN: How you doing, man? I'm Sean. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is Robert. &gt;&gt; ROB: How you doing? &gt;&gt; SEAN: Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: These are the babies. What do you think? &gt;&gt; SEAN: Try it out. See how it feels. &gt;&gt; ROB: This one's cool. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'd say I will go with the full-size. &gt;&gt; SEAN: Let's do it. Have you fill this out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Start filling it out. I know it's never probably ever going to be used, but I have the ability to protect my family, and that's a good comforting feeling. Have a good safe day. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: You seem so calm. &gt;&gt; KIM: You know, it's not really much to think about or talk about. Although the judge didn't accept the motion for the emergency divorce, this at least got everyone to set a trial date. And that has forced a deposition date today. I'm just glad we finally scheduled this. It was supposed to happen, like, a year ago. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Kimmy. I just wanted to call and wish you good luck for your depo. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, thank you. I think you're gonna feel probably much better when it's done. &gt;&gt; KIM:Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Love you, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, bye. I wonder if he's gonna be there today. There's, like, literally, at, like, our lunch break, I'm gonna want to, like, talk to him and be, like, "I just want to say, like, it never had to get like this. I, like, loved you, you know? I still do. Like, you were a big part of my life. But no, we're not meant to be together. Like, you weren't happy, I wasn't happy. We never should have rushed into it, you know? It doesn't mean, like, we can't, like, be friends." I haven't spoken to Kris in about a year and a half. I'm anxious to see Kris. I hope that maybe this will give him and I some understanding of my feelings and his feelings, since we haven't spoken in so long. 886 00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:04,696 &gt;&gt; WOMAN: It's 8:23. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ooh, I gotta go. Captioning sponsored by BUNIM-MURRAY PRODUCTIONS Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey, babe. Hey, guess what I got here. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: What? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: The gun safe. Want to help? Safeguard America's future. So do you think just the two of use should know where this thing is, or should we tell everybody? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Yeah. No, just us. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just the two of us? Okay. For now. Maybe they'll come around. With the gun in the house, we're making progress slowly. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: "Tilt it to its side." This way. "Reach inside and locate the two bolts behind the lock housing as shown in..." &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, the batteries are in. That works. There we go. All right. That's gonna work. Let's go find a place to put thing... that nobody knows where it is. &gt;&gt; LALA: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. So skinny. &gt;&gt; LALA: You look so cute. You look so cute. Let me see your stomach. Sit back. Oh, yeah, you have a stomach now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; LALA: No, like, full baby. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; LALA: How many pounds? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's one pound. &gt;&gt; LALA: One pound? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just so emotionally drained after a deposition. I'm even too exhausted to sit with my family. I just want to see one of my closest friends-- Lala. &gt;&gt; LALA: Your stomach is out! &gt;&gt; KIM: Isn't that crazy? &gt;&gt; LALA: Oh, my God! When did that happen? &gt;&gt; KIM: Probably, like, a week ago. It's crazy because if I wear tanks that are loose, I could still almost hide it, especially in the morning. &gt;&gt; LALA: Okay, so how did it go today? How many hours? &gt;&gt; KIM: Seven. &gt;&gt; LALA: With no break? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, no, you could take a break. In all honesty, I was hoping Kris would be there. They said he was gonna be there. He plays the Clippers this weekend, so I thought he was gonna be there. &gt;&gt; LALA: Oh, yeah, I thought he would be there. &gt;&gt; KIM: If there was, like, a lunch break or something I would have said, like, "Can I talk to you? Like, when this is all said and done, I just want you to know that I really did love you and..." &gt;&gt; LALA: It's important. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's important for me that he really knows that. &gt;&gt; LALA: Right. And when the divorce happened, you were really grappling with that. It wasn't like you were, like, "Yo, let me get a divorce. All right, cool." Like, that wasn't a easy decision for you. I was there for all of it. 939 00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:44,455 You were in my house crying. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; LALA: Did this just stress you out, or no? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I'm a little disappointed Kris didn't show up, but there's nothing I can really do. I don't want to stress out about it anymore. So, you know, I just have to be calm and collected. And I'm just relieved that this 947 00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:08,112 is, you know, the first step to finally moving on. Keeping Up with the Kardashians: &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce, were you at that game? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Was I what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce has a hearing problem. &gt;&gt; BRODY: It seems like you don't hear when people are talking to you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What? &gt;&gt; BRODY: That's a natural thing that happens to everybody. &gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Have you ever had an MRI of your brain? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No. I'm a little nervous about this. What if they find, like, something's wrong? &gt;&gt; ROB: Have you seen this girl's bucket list? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There's a woman who's very sick, and she wants to meet me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You could be, like, changing someone's life. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Scott, thank you.
