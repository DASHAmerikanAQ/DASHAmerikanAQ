- Keeping Up with the Kardashians... &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Good! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Kourtney looks the best she's ever looked. She's laughing again, and just being the Kourtney I knew, like, five years ago. &gt;&gt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Damn! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I told you I'm going to Montana Sunday? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who's gonna watch the kids? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You guys are taking them to San Diego. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Being in the car with three toddlers is the best form of birth control. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just... I just can't do this. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Did you take anything today? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: My life is officially over. I just want it to be over. &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to call the police. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I gotta go. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your fave! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait, can I Snapchat you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look what I brought you...! Your favorite! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You're so cute! You're so nice! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why is it all white? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wait. Ew! Don't actually kiss me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. Okay, I won't. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're welcome. I love what's going on outside. Remember when we used to do work in the backyard and I used to bring Krispy Kremes to all the guys? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Should we give them a box? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give them a box and tell them to enjoy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Will you do it? I feel like you're, like, a woman, I'm, like, a little child. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is how it's done. Hey, guys. Want some donuts? Donuts! I'm gonna put them here so they're not in the sun. But don't leave them out here, too hot. &gt;&gt; MAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay? Krispy Kreme. &gt;&gt; MAN: Thank you! &gt;&gt; KRIS: See, Kylie? Pretty easy. Sugar makes anybody happy. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That was really nice, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You need to have, like, little lessons in how to be a great hostess. Are you going up my nostril? ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How was your trip, Kourt? Did you talk to Scott when you were gone? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, no. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim and I were at my house and we were in the kitchen, and Corey called and put us on speaker so we could just listen to their conversation. But he was really upset and having a hard time and said he missed you and he had no reason to live, and it was pretty scary. We didn't know whether to call 911... &gt;&gt; KIM: He was literally, like, you couldn't hear sentences, like, he was slurring his words. The note that he sent Khloe was, like, "Tell Bugs I love her and I can't go on without her." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They say you always should call 911. &gt;&gt; KIM: So we... I almost did because then he was crying on the phone the whole time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And Chris said, "I've never seen him cry that hard. All he does is cry." &gt;&gt; KIM: But... then I got a text last night, and I'm like, oh, my God, Scott just took some... They said he was drunk... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Last night? &gt;&gt; KIM: Last night. You know? So after that whole thing, and he's crying and he's this and he's that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I think Scott put himself in the situation that he's in, with his actions. I don't know, I just need to, like, live, because I'm also, like, not just making decisions for me but for, you know, my three children, and it's really about him deciding just what kind of life he wants to live. That's the thing, it's, like, then do something about it. &gt;&gt; KIM: We've said that a million times. And I didn't want to bring you the drama, but then I felt like it was serious yesterday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. That's why I was like, just call the police-- 'cause either you save someone's life or he's bluffing and then you... You know? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Kokes? What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just editing. Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're really, like... &gt;&gt; KIM: Huge. I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you're actually not-- you're more belly this time. &gt;&gt; KIM: And butt. I look back at pictures, and I was so skinny, just my belly, so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You think that-- you really weren't. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, go look, and you'll like, die. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim went with North. How many months pregnant were you there? &gt;&gt; KIM: I gave birth the next week. To even get up out of bed every night, I have to be, like... It's, like, a full sit-up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't get the six-pack now, I don't think. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God, you were skinny after North. Okay, I am supposed to be writing and you're distracting me. I'm googling pictures of you pregnant-- like, this is... you're not helping me. &gt;&gt; KIM: How is your book-writing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, it's very time-consuming, and I have to... &gt;&gt; KIM: So time-consuming, right? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...read everything to make sure, 'cause they keep, like, adding things that I don't want added. I am writing a book, and it's Strong Looks Better and it's really about being strong-- mind, body and soul. And I really enjoy writing the book, but I have so much going on, I'm so overwhelmed. And my book has a release date that's been highly publicized, so I cannot push back that release date. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. They took care of it. Stop! I'd be mortified. Send me a picture. Oh, wait... Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim. You're distracting the writing process. &gt;&gt; KIM: Definitely do it. Bye. I think you need a dose of fun. This is, like, taking over your life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is, but I have... I just want it done. I want it out of my way, done. And then we could have all the fun in the world. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have put much work into this book. Like... beyond. And I had no idea how draining writing a book is. So when I do have, like, three hours to commit to the book, I need to be laser-focused. So I need to be antisocial and really buckle down. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so should I sit here and be quiet... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...and then when you're ready to have fun...? 'Cause this is really comfy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I sometimes write in my bathroom on my vanity. Do you want to lay in here and I'll go in there? I'll just... Okay, you lay there. I need to focus. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. Look at all this stuff. &gt;&gt; BILL: Isn't it remarkable? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. Well, Kylie-- she's so excited to move into her new house. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm excited to see how she moves into her place and takes care of it by herself... and learns how to run a home. &gt;&gt; BILL: How exciting. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I know. &gt;&gt; BILL: You're gonna get a kick out of this. We have a couple of interesting products. So, you'll notice here, we call this the "Luminous." A-And... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, that's so pretty. &gt;&gt; BILL: Feel this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BILL: Isn't that a cool texture? this one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. We need that. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You guys are getting me so excited. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm excited for you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're a big girl! My baby. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm a big girl now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My house is almost finished up, and the last thing I really wanted to do was go to Toto and get a few things. It is nice to just have my own place. I'm excited about it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, have you decided when you get your new toilets who's gonna clean them? Is it gonna be you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well... yes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Where are the ones that warm up and... &gt;&gt; BILL: Oh, let's go look at that. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...practically... &gt;&gt; BILL: Yeah, right over here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...answer your e-mails for you? &gt;&gt; BILL: Let's come in here for a second, we're gonna walk into the bathroom. What I was gonna show you, how when you turn this on that wand come out... and spray. When you turn the position, move it in, move it out... &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel like I'm at the gynecologist's office. &gt;&gt; BILL: Oscillate. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my. &gt;&gt; BILL: When you get up and walk away from using the bathroom, you've never been so clean. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's amazing. Two of those, please. Next time, Kylie, you can come shopping all by yourself. All right, bye, guys. ♫ ♫ Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Bring the light around just a little bit. Take a small step backwards. Like... Yeah, there you go. That's it, great. Right there. ♫ ♫ Yeah. Nice. That's it. Okay. Beautiful. Very nice. Perfect. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Are those yours? &gt;&gt; WOMAN 2: Those are all mine. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Kim. &gt;&gt; KIM: What are you shooting for? Evening Standard magazine in London. &gt;&gt; KIM: Is it about business? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; KIM: Good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's what the interview's all about that I'm doing next, downstairs. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, fab. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aren't those shoes great? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Look at the ones I have on. &gt;&gt; KIM: Very cool. You should have told me you were buying equipment-- I have all that equipment and I'm selling all my equipment. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But I said can we use it, and you said you didn't want to separate any of the equipment 'cause you wanted to keep it all together and perfect, so when you put it back in your gym... Remember? I asked you? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, but I'm selling all of mine, 'cause I want light gray instead of black. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I'm gonna go shoot this. &gt;&gt; KIM: All right. I feel bad. Wait, can I tell you what's so annoying? I just have to say it one last time and then I won't say it ever again? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: So, one of my bathrooms has to be different, because you took my ten marble slabs. I need to now buy seven slabs of marble, or I have to change two of my bathrooms, 'cause I can't have my whole house be one marble and then two rooms another marble. When we moved in with my mom the first time, we bought a whole ton of marble-- all these slabs from out of the country. Then she took my marble, has never mentioned it, has never paid for it, and... now I have to figure out a new plan. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim... let me... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No. No. No. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I went to your house to see what you were talking about. &gt;&gt; KIM: I had to change Kanye's whole bathroom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Really? Really? Because you didn't have one slab of marble? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, no, no, we needed ten and you took ten. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I took six. In the United States... &gt;&gt; KIM: No, ten. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Six. &gt;&gt; KIM: They just sent me the invoice today-- you took ten. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're charging me for the marble? &gt;&gt; KIM: Absolutely. My marble cost me $1 million. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This whole situation is ridiculous. And had I known Kim wanted to charge me for marble, then I would have made other decisions in the first place. I'm really getting frustrated with the lack of communication with my family. &gt;&gt; KIM: They don't have that same marble. I have Calcutta Gold. It's only from Italy. They only have Calcutta. They do not have Calcutta Gold in stock, or I'm gonna have to wait. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How much will you give me if I find you ten slabs of Calcutta Gold? &gt;&gt; KIM: $1 million. 'Cause I've asked every slab... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: $1 million. &gt;&gt; KRIS: $1 million. $1 million. &gt;&gt; KIM: In the United States that is r... that is here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If I have to rip it out of that bathroom. I will find you ten slabs. &gt;&gt; KIM: They don't have it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We are going to have a housewarming party. Do you want me to plan it for you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. I'm 18. I want it to be how I want it to be. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm spreading myself too thin with the app, with the DASH buying, with the book. On top of everything that I'm doing, I have to finish editing my book. I am so stressed out. Wh-What's more important? Your daughter's sanity? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This weather is wild. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Don't you love how I'm, like, compact, that I can, like, totally fit in the chair? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hate it. &gt;&gt; MALIKA:I'm a little critter. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you... why are you stopping? I just would like to understand. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You and Khadijah with the road rage. It's-it's another level. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, when there's the thing in the middle, you're allowed to turn before the p... the pedestrian crosses the thing. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Why don't you be a traffic cop? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Anyway... &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Side job. Side hustle. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, Kris Jenner flaked on today, as she was, like, "So how badly do you need me on this thing? It's... Like you haven't done a talk show before. I have to work." I said, "You know it's your job, right?" "No. Uh-uh. Got to work." I'm booked on a talk show today because of my mom. It's just pissing me off. I'm definitely feeling a ton of pressure. I have so many appearances or DASH stuff or just book editing. And my mom needs to stop booking me on things. She's adding to my life instead of helping me right now. It's just crazy. And God forbid I would want my manager at a talk show with me. That's what they normally do. She should apologize and said, "I'm so sorry. How can I make this up to you?" &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Like, you guys just need to talk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You think, Sherlock? Everyone is a ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Mama. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Why you bring a rice cupcake? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Why did I bring it? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For a snacky-snack. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's a really cute skirt, P. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, do I get a grand tour? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. So exciting. Come on, dogs. You can come. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you gonna keep this table? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I like it there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Could also put this thing there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause you have space. Could always see what it looks like. Kourtney tips for the day. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My toilet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It was my dream for the longest time. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Really? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. Toto. I love that. My room's my favorite of the whole house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you going to have a housewarming party? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Um, maybe I will. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Any excuse for a party. Um, do you want me to plan it for you? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No. I do want to have a housewarming party. And my family is kind of known for throwing extravagant parties, but I kind of want this to be chill and just the people that I love. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hi, Mother. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so nice and neat. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks. I'm a changed woman. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You really are. I'm kind of impressed. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thanks, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All that bitching at you for 18 years must have paid off. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We are going to have a housewarming party here. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You know I love you guys, but I want to plan this by myself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why don't you cater it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I think it is really sweet that Kourtney and my mom want to help me with this party. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What about, like, mini milkshakes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mac and cheese. Like, little grilled cheeses. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Rice Krispy treats. Cotton candy. &gt;&gt; KRIS: A sushi bar. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But I'm 18. I want it to be how I want it to be and throw my first housewarming party on my own. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't forget you need valet parking and probably dessert and... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Who said you're invited? &gt;&gt; KRIS: To your housewarming party? When I practically built this house myself? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Unfortunately. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is my whore of a mother? &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: She said she was 25 minutes about ten minutes ago. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I think I just canceled whatever was on the sixth because then I have L.A. press, like, that Monday. &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So, um... Yeah, whatever. I don't even know what I'm saying 'cause I hate life. Am I in a bad mood today? &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: I can't wait till Kris Jenner gets here 'cause she's just gonna get it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, gorge. Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; MAN: How are you? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. How are you? &gt;&gt; MA: You look gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you just start shooting just now? &gt;&gt; MAN: We waited for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yay. You're so little. &gt;&gt; SHEIVA: So little. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, let's start shooting. So I need the music on. So you and I can't talk during music 'cause I can't shoot just, like, silent. I am beyond livid with my mom because she overbooked me on top of everything that I'm doing. I have to finish editing my book before the release date. I'm so stressed out about it. I want it to be a success. Like, I have no time to do anything. I don't want to slow down our set. I've been up since 4:00 working. I'm not in the mood today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So beautiful, Khloe. That's it. That's the cover. ♫ ♫ Really good. I just wanted to come by and say hi and see what you were doing. Because you're, like, on this runaway train, and I can't seem to get you on the phone. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm spreading myself too thin with the app, with the DASH buying, with the book, which is the biggest nightmare. I'm over it. I can't work this much. Cancel something. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm sorry you're overwhelmed, and I'm sorry you're feeling like this. And I will do everything I can. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Since I've never, ever, ever asked to not do something before. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I hear you. Khloe, you agreed that this was a good idea. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I've expressed how I feel. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just telling you I'm repeating... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I normally don't ask you things like that. When have I ever said, "Cancel something"? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Never. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wh-What's more important? Your daughter's sanity? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, housewarming party. Let's, like, make a slide from your hill, like, going into the pool. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know how many times I have to say I can handle this on my own. I don't even want to do it anymore. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to set up a meeting with this communication professional over always being on our phones. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I normally don't ask you things like that. When have I ever said, "Cancel something"? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Never. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wh-What's more important? Your daughter's sanity? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I'll take care of it. Just breathe. I'll take care of it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, you just breathe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You agreed that this was a good idea. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What theare you talking about? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You agreed to scheduling all of this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, I didn't, Mom. You're aliar. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I feel bad that Khloe's feeling overwhelmed, but this is what we planned for months. And we've gone over every bit of it. When you're stressed out and tired and feeling overworked, it makes it more magnified. Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have to do all my jobs, and that's why I'm saying, before another one starts, let's diminish it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I understand. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, I don't think you do. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I do. All right, I'm gonna go. I love you. Go to your happy place. Like, think about Mary Poppins or something. Just go to a different place in your head so you can get through your day. And get something to eat. I love you very much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What theis your obsession with food? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It'll make you feel better. Promise. Love you! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to show you something. Why did Rob post this of you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Because I cussed him out earlier, so he probably felt bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: I get, like, the girl and you just get purple hair. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love when Rob calls Gone Girl. That was the best New Year's Day ever. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, you guys, I want to set up a meeting with this communication professional to go over always being on our phones. And I found this really great person that Kourtney actually found. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, a meeting about always being on our phones? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, what? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. You're never not on your phone. I'm so sick and tired of them not listening, having Khloe telling me to cancel events. As her manager, it's not professional. So I decided to let Kourtney set us up with her friend Erica. It's like you don't listen, not one of you. And I think we all have to have a powwow about communication. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: My friend from college is a communication expert. This is one of the topics that she talks about. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If this girl can talk some sense into you and your sisters and your brother, then hallelujah. A communications meeting is going to be a great tool for them to be in the moment, pay attention and not yell at me anymore. I think that we're missing a lot of really great moments with each other. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm always the one that tells you, "Put your phone down, we're at dinner." &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think if you guys were to give it a chance and come see what I'm talking about, you might get some real good out of it. It's like a little workshop. Would that... An activity. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really don't get you-- you know how stressed out I've been, writing my book. And you want to add one more thing to my list? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just listen to what the woman has to say and maybe you'll take away one positive thing from the experience. What do you think? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Sure. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm, that means "sure". &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just said sure, I'll go, I don't know how else you want me to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. At least come with a good attitude. Bye, guys. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:whack job. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How was the rest of her night? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Who? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kennys-- I saw... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I did not see her. Kendall sat with them the entire dinner. Then all of us literally finished eating, JJ went to go check on her and JJ never came back, so ten minutes later I went, and I'm like, "The cars are outside, we're ready to go, we all want to go to Nice Guy, let's hit it." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: And she goes, "Get another car, Kylie." And I was like, "Okay", like, it's Haley's birthday." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, the teenage drams. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So much teenage drams. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. So exciting. Um, okay, housewarming party-- what are we gonna do? We need to, like, make this the ultimate housewarming party. Like, what about if we get, like, flowers on your table and you need, like, we need to light all the candles and we need... Let's, like, make a slide from your hill, like, going into the pool. Like, I'm, like, living my life though you. Um, we need to get the dogs, like, have them go, like, on a vacation for the day. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: A vacation for the day? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just wanted like, simplicity and I just kind of wanted to do it my way. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But my way is the best way. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I know, but I have to learn to have my own way. I just feel like I want to do something low-key. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: As long as you get my approval. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't know how many times I have to say I'm grown now, I'm 18, I can handle this on my own. Sometimes, with my family, it's just easier to nod your head and brush things off your shoulder. Honestly, I don't even know if I want to do it anymore. Kourtney's been over and she's, like, been rearranging all my furniture and trying to tell me, like, how to do my house. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: It's your decision, it's your house, it's your money, it's your area. Do what you want. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Tell one thing that you appreciate about them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, I feel like you're always in a good mood. Not really-- lately you've been a little cranky. Clearly, Khloe has been stressed out. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Hello? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey, Daddy-O. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Hey, babe. Oh, you know what, I was just going to call you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Cute. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I r... Honestly, I just picked up the phone and I was saying, "I got to call Kylie." What's up? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Um, yeah, I just wanted to talk to you because Kourtney and Mom have been just, like... I don't know what the right word is-- maybe, like, invasive or, like, pushy, kind of, about my housewarming party. Kourtney's been over and she's, like, been rearranging all my furniture and trying to tell me, like, how to do my house and I kind of wanted to do this, like, on my own, you know, and have that experience. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: I don't blame you. All right, here's the deal... But it's your decision, it's your house, it's your money, it's your area. Do exactly what you want to do. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, all righty. I think I'm just gonna take my dad's advice and just do whatever I want to do, 'cause it's my housewarming party and it's gonna be done how Kylie house parties are gonna be done. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Anyway, good, what else is going on-- anything exciting? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, I did a photo shoot today. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Rocking it, girl. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: It was pretty cool. I had this cute little love interest. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Good. Good, all right. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay, love you. &gt;&gt; CAITLYN: Love you, bye! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Bye. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom is so annoying. Did you guys see her outfit today? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, what is she wearing? &gt;&gt; KIM: My Balmain outfit that she took from me with a thin, black velvet choker. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you pissed or happy? &gt;&gt; KIM: Fuming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Where is Mom? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom and I planned this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: So then why is Mom not here, though? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom flew off to Paris. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shocker that she's making us do this. My mom forgot to communicate with herself that she had a appointment. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; ERICA: I'm good, how are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe and Kim are here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's a no-show for her own communication meeting that she orchestrated. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Okay, so your mama and Kourtney both call... well, we met, when, like, a couple weeks ago, to dine and discuss communication issues. Also work on putting the phones away, which... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, like she's one to talk. &gt;&gt; ERICA: I know. We could start with a little exercise-- I want you to... for... so Khloe, let's say you start and you tell Kim and Kourtney one thing that you appreciate about them, internally. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I appreciate your... ability to be so honest. &gt;&gt; KIM: That could be a good thing or a bad thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I was gonna say it depends what it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I appreciate it. What I love about you is your strength as, like, a mother just to, like, hold everything together. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Mm-hmm. Your turn. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would say Kim's ability, like, to do it all. &gt;&gt; ERICA: Mm-hmm, yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It is a good one. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe, I admire, like, just, like, your energy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You definitely live in the moment. Like, what we're... been talking about, to be present. Like, you're definitely present in, like, whatever situation you're at. I feel like you're always in a good mood. Not really-- lately you've been a little cranky. Clearly Khloe has been totally inconsistent lately and, like, stressed out, because she's a workaholic. And I want her to be happy. Nobody wants her to feel burned out. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're writing this book and it has to be true. It's, like, about mind, body and soul, so you have to live it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When do we ever live it? &gt;&gt; KIM: You just need to take some time for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no, no, not on her beautiful chairs! This sucks. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's only guacamole. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can get guacamole up your vagina right now. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: What kind of cookie should I have, iced oatmeal? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's the last one I would choose. Uh... terrible. &gt;&gt; KIM: This one's not that icy. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't touch them all. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mmm, but these ones are so good, though. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They are, I haven't had one in so long. &gt;&gt; KIM: How is the book coming along? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just... It's, like, the most annoying thing ever, is to write a book. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And Mom goes, "Why do you have to read it so many times?" I said, "'Cause every time I write something, like, they "change it, so, yeah, I have to read every single edit-- the "whole thing-- from start to finish, every time, because who "knows what they're s... like, sinking in there." I just feel super overwhelmed with just, like, everything. Like, just the traveling for Kardashian Kollection and Kardashian Kids and, like, DASH and then a book writing and then that and then a stupid photo shoots and, like, just everything. It's, like, one too many things. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, I think you are definitely overwhelmed. You're writing this book and it has to be true. It's, like, about mind, body and soul, so you have to live it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When do we ever live it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Living what you're writing. I think Khloe needs to really start living in the moment and really living the truth of what she is writing about in this book, and just I think it's time for her to focus on the project she's really passionate about so she isn't spread too thin. I think sometimes we just get so busy that we put so much energy into the negative instead of just being productive. You just need to take some time for you. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, this is where you want to sit? &gt;&gt; KIM: What a pretty view. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know, we sit out here and have breakfast sometimes. &gt;&gt; KIM: This is how I sit having breakfast with Kanye-- I like to sit next to him. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I like sitting across. &gt;&gt; KIM: Aah! It's a spider! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: Get it theoff me. Why was that on your face? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What kind was it? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know, but I never would have grabbed it had I known it was a spider. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: A little bit scared. &gt;&gt; KIM: How annoying was that that Mom didn't even show up to our communication thing that she set up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Ultra annoying. &gt;&gt; KIM: So rude. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And so weird. Like, Mom... &gt;&gt; KIM: What's that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Feel like she just wants us to be off of our phones. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. We need to tell her, like, things that we had to do in that class that she forced us to do... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Forced us to do. And make her do them. &gt;&gt; KIM: Something to where we just, like, kind of, like, mock her. I think my mom was trying to blame things on us to make it seem like we're so disconnected and always on our phones when I think she's a little bit more disconnected. As our manager, I think she should let us know when she's gonna go travel the world, and she needs to learn a lesson that, you know, at least we're all communicating with each other. Should we put her in a dunk tank, and say that that is, like, one of our requests? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Trust? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, like a trust thing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, but where on earth do you get a dunk tank? &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't know. We'll rent one. Let's call her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's up, honey? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, so you know how you missed our exercises with Erica? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: She thought it would be good to do them all together with you, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, lucky me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you set it up. What do you mean lucky you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, you're the one who wanted to do this in the first place. I'm shocked that you're not, like, dying to do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, I am excited. I'm excited to see what she had to say. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, so we're gonna do it... &gt;&gt; KIM: We'll set it up. Like, when we get, like, Khloe here and everything, we'll all do it together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, well, I have another call holding. Can I call you guys right back? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No need. &gt;&gt; KIM: Nothing pleasures me more than, like, pranking my mom, and we are gonna let my mom know that she is no better than we are. There are consequences for her missing the communication session. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where does this go? &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, since you missed the communication thing, you get a choice. You get to either... &gt;&gt; KRIS: A choice? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...sit in that thing, and we get to throw something at that target, or the surprise. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Hey. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, look at the wallpaper up there. What's going on? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Wanted to see you guys and host a cute dinner. Cute. What is this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a diffuser, so you can... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Cute. Does it have little things in it? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Where are they? &gt;&gt; KIM: She's a regifter. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: White cake? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, baby! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know. It's everything. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What's happening? &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi, baby. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You guys, this is so cute! No one's really been at my house together. I'm super excited about my housewarming party, and I decided I'd invite everyone the day of the party, and just kind of wanted this one to be all me, and not worry about other opinions. Hopefully, they just enjoy themselves and think that I am a good hostess. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She did such a beautiful job. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cute! &gt;&gt; KRIS: She got our favorite food. Where did these come from? I love these. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney Kardashian. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I skipped... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Those are really... I have these in gold. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I bought these for her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, where did you get these flowers from? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Tyga. He gives me flowers, like, every day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's so nice. I will say, your house has turned out so good. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's so good. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So cute. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It is. I love it. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It has good vibes. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I just wanted to say... thank you guys for coming, and I appreciate it. And I didn't expect any housewarming presents. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Aren't you happy? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm so proud of Kylie. She's, like, such a little grown-up, and I feel like she really got the skills about, like, hosting and how to keep your household, and I'll back off and let her, you know, take charge of her own house. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yum. This is good luck. Your first piece of cake in your house. I didn't put it on my rolls. It's so good. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That's a step. Just clean. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's so good. &gt;&gt; COREY: Good. Clean. Pardon me. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Shut up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have to go out tonight, so please don't do that to me. Oh, no. No! Not on her beautiful chairs! Oh, my God, you guys, look what you're doing! You can't clean this up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, my God. Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can not clean this. There is guacamole all over your shoes, all the guacamole. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna get guacamole up your vagina. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is going on... right now? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Spread your legs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not the best choice of a chair if you can't clean it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Spread your legs. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Got to stop with the guac. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Look what you did to this chair. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tell her to spread her legs. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's very excited about the... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: See that knife right there? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's literally going up your &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney, someone just help me with the dog. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What do you want in your vodka drink, Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just nothing. It's fine just with some ice. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You are the biggest whore on the planet. Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's a unicorn! It is a unicorn! Oh! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Well, I'm glad I threw really mature. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ooh, you look like Chiquita Banana! &gt;&gt; KYLIE: But I don't know about them so much. &gt;&gt; COREY: Oh, she scared you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? Kylie, we just blessed your house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And you're welcome. We just blessed your house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Avocado is good for your hair. I don't think sour cream is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I think I got it all over my blazer, which is really bad. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kylie's like, "Get theout of my house." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo? Congrats... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...on finishing your book. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm so excited for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I feel so sick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait. Are you, like, fully done? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I mean... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna start making vichy while we're talking because I have to go home. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm going on my book tour. Gonna be gone for two and a half weeks. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Where's the non-Teflon stuff? This copper, I think, is not Teflon. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What does it talk about? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Just about, just 'cause you're going through a hard time in your life doesn't mean you have to, like, break and crumble. There's so many things to be thankful for, and just, let's turn negatives into positives. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: When do I get a copy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't know. It's to the printer now. Press tour starts November 3, so, I'm assuming soon. I feel like I started getting so consumed with all of the negatives in my life, and I started looking at things in such a negative way, and it was taking its toll on me. And once I actually refocused myself, I finally finished my book. And from writing my book, it's become so therapeutic, making me actually live what I'm writing. Feel like I'm getting back into the positive mind-body-soul. What is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Cream. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. Kourtney, is this milk? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's milk, and cream is at the top, naturally. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That looks so... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: That is kind of nasty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...disgusting. I only drink almond milk, so what do I do then? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You don't have cream. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: But you should make your own almond milk. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, really? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You should actually have somebody make it for you. It takes five minutes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: God, she is wild. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Can't believe Khloe is sick and missing our pie-making. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know. A pie is so much easier to make than I thought. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you buy the crust. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You want a cherry? Or sprinkles? &gt;&gt; KIM: Sprinkles! Yes! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Extra creamy for this one. Mom's in for a big surprise. Kim and I are doing a little fun prank on my mom because she didn't show up at the communication session that she set up. Okay. We're done. We all have communication issues in our family, so, we are just gonna test her and really prove to her that she is a huge part of the problem herself. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you start decorating? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Not really. I just pulled out a couple things. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. Where does this... Where does this go? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. So... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you guys doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have an option. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. So, I'm here to do the communications thing, so what's all of this? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, since you missed the communication thing last time, you clearly need to know how to communicate with your children. You get a choice. You get to either... &gt;&gt; KRIS: A choice? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...sit in that thing, and we get to throw something at that target, or you can have option B, which is a surprise. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You guys are the ones who needed the communications session. I'm fine with how I communicate with people. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. We need to communicate together, so that's why people do, like, couples therapy or things like that, or, like, family therapy, 'cause they need to know together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't want to have couples therapy with you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: This meeting that you set up... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And we had our meeting with Erica. &gt;&gt; KIM: This was your whole thing. Okay, so pick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Pick. Which one? Option one, two or both? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, so pick. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Pick. Which one? Option one, two or both? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is it cash-related? &gt;&gt; KIM: Maybe. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, I'll do one of each. It's probably throwing up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Go sit down in the special seat. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can do both. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, what do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Sit down. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is, like, a contraption that... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How do I put this when I'm not tall enough? : Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! That'scold! That is so mean! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That wasn't... &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was not very nice! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was just putting it in. &gt;&gt; KRIS: My God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Wait, don't stop... No, I have to go somewhere! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, I can't... I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I have to go somewhere. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, thank God it didn't pop! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim, come back. We need to do it. &gt;&gt; KIM: And she missed! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: First question... what is my due date? &gt;&gt; KRIS: December the 24th. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nope! Wrong-o! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What?! Uh... &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God! This is not a fun game! I don't want to play this anymore. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, wait, what is North's middle name? &gt;&gt; KRIS: South. Okay, that hurt. What is North's middle name? &gt;&gt; KIM: North doesn't have a middle name! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, we have one more! &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was so confusing. Really? Only my kids would put me through this kind of torture and love it this much. &gt;&gt; KIM: How many years has DASH been open? &gt;&gt; KRIS: 16, 17... Wait, hold on. Six! &gt;&gt; KIM: 11! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KIM: 11! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, right! I meant 11! Okay, I'll go to the next meeting. But the truth is they're right, and I probably could use a little meeting about our communication skills. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have a nice day! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait! You guys, I can't see. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my gosh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Damn it. I can't see! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: On the next episode... &gt;&gt; ALL: Happy birthday! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, you guys are all dressed like me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This month is crazy for birthdays. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: This is so intimidating. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We are recording the song for my mom's birthday party. Who's the Beyoncé, guys? We all know it's me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Scott has gone to rehab. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I hope he stays and does the treatment. That's thepart about life is we have no guarantees.
