- &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, sister? Sister, come here. What's my name? Say "KoKo." You want this? Say "KoKo." Say "KoKo." You said it already today. Okay, have one taste so you see how good it is-- yeah! You want more? Oh, you understand that? Do you want this? Say my name. Ooh, and if I give you a little sprinkles? You like that? Say "KoKo." Say "KoKo." Can you tell sister to say my name? &gt;&gt; MASON: I think I can't do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You can't? Can you just tell her to say my name 'cause she's not listening to me. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Mama! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want some? You want some? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I see you're eating my yogurt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm hanging out with the kids. I'm feeding your child. Can you say "KoKo"? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You say "Stop eating my food." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you saying "Stop eating my food"? Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What kind of haircut do you want? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I don't know. I have not had a haircut in probably a year and something. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shocker, right? &gt;&gt; PHILIP: Yeah, I see that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, can you tell that? I want to keep it long in the front, 'cause I like wearing it in a ponytail, and if you get it too short in the front, you can't, you don't have a ponytail. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Wait, so we're not getting rid of the ponytail? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, we're not getting rid of the ponytail. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's fine. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: See? Thank you. &gt;&gt; PHILIP: I would suggest layers. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Long layers. &gt;&gt; PHILIP: Long layers. But where's it at now, it's starting to kind of look like a bob, and it's just not... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, yeah, it doesn't know what it wants to look like right now. &gt;&gt; PHILIP: Yeah, it's not as flattering as it could be, so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, maybe a half-inch or so. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Are you gonna cry? I feel like you're really, like, this is hard for you to let go. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm sure it is. That's like when I grow out my eyebrows and everyone bugs me to tweeze them. And I end up doing it... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's the same?! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Society or somebody else is telling you to do it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: "Society," seriously? It's Kris Jenner, not society. That's why you're cutting your hair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That's true. Well, that is true. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom is really adamant that Bruce cut his ponytail off, and I don't like the ponytail so I get it. But it's also not my head. It's Bruce's decision. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You watch him, Khloe, that he's not taking too much off, okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: 'Cause I can't see. I don't have a mirror. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Want to go look in the mirror? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, let's go check it out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hey! See? That looks good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It looks really good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's still long, but it looks good. Good job, Philip! &gt;&gt; PHILIP: All right, you're welcome. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Step one is done. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I feel very cleaned up. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It looks exactly the same. But he's feeling good about himself, and if a ponytail makes Bruce happy and smile every day, rock on with your bad self, Bruce. &gt;&gt; TRACEY: Bruce! How are you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Fine, Trace, how are you doing? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi! &gt;&gt; TRACEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Tracey? &gt;&gt; TRACEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you have a vision? &gt;&gt; TRACEY: I think that if we lighten this up, I think... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We'll be... &gt;&gt; TRACEY: Kris will be happy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I... We're not worried about Kris, we're worried about me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look, like, this is... look. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, no, no, no, no! You're not allowed here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Did you get it cut? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, we cut it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I got it all cut off. You weren't supposed to be here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, I came by for some highlights. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Here I am, happy. It seems to be going pretty good. He didn't cut too much off. And then Kris walks in. Aw, man! She is very opinionated. I had a good little thing going over here, you know? Don't mess it up. &gt;&gt; TRACEY: First I'm highlighting it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He looks like a baked potato. I think it should just be more layered here on the sides. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Don't worry, honey, it's, everything's fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just because Bruce and I are separated doesn't mean that I don't want him to look and feel his best. The color's amazing. The cut's a little crazy. &gt;&gt; TRACEY: It needs to be cut into, like... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let me, let me sleep on it. &gt;&gt; TRACEY: Promise. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And then we'll go from there, yeah. &gt;&gt; TRACEY: I'm about to get some scissors right now and just do it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Tracey could just cut into it, Bruce, so just... &gt;&gt; TRACEY: I don't, I didn't bring any scissors... &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was our deal. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you don't, Kris! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't have to get that freaky look on your face. We're just making it look good. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll be fine. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom and Bruce definitely still bicker like they're living under the same roof. Bruce has been, you know, doing things everyone else's way for a really long time, and I think he's just getting tired of it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It could be so cool. &gt;&gt; TRACEY: Yeah, no, no, I know! &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's no coolness about that, it's like a hot mess. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For you. For you, my lady. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Made with 100% L-O-V-E. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Question. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hmm? We had it... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall and Kylie on you guys? It's so unreal. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, it's so to die. They look like twins. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They're so cool. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Our, um, painting arrives tomorrow, our lottery ticket. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, God, this again? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Your lottery ticket? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's a Modigliani, he's major. We had the painting mailed from, um, Jeff and Bonnie's house when we were there. If it's real, our lives are changing. After Scott's mom and dad passed away, we were at their house going through some items and organizing things. There is this one painting that I really think is real, and so we decide to fly the art home so that we can get it appraised. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's for sure a copy. There's no way my parents just had some multi-multi-multi million dollar painting laying around the house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, 'cause they didn't buy it themselves. Your great-grandmother lived in a house and when she bought the house, they left their artwork there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And so... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why would they leave that, though? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Exactly, no one's leaving a Modigliani around. The last one at Sotheby's in London sold for, like, $145 million. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: If it is, you got to break me off a piece. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That would be so cool. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We didn't just hit the lotto! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, what would happen if it was? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna pay off my house. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Buy some furniture. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Buy some furniture. Maybe a bed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dear, let's just be honest-- this is not happening. I really don't know a ton about art. I do know that this artist is an extremely famous artist if it's authentic. But I also know, for every authentic famous painter, there's a trillion other people that are copying them and selling them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I am going to buy you a private plane for Christmas. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want a private plane. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, don't be ridiculous. We're not buying anyone a plane. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, hey there. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I know Kendall's in New York, but I thought Kylie was here. I looked in the fridge and there was a sandwich, so I'm eating it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You don't have any foo-food at home? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I have food, I'm not starving, but I didn't have much today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is this the first time you're eating today? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, usually... &gt;&gt; KRIS: You got to take care of yourself. You're gonna get too thin. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I'm-I'm the exact same way I have always been, I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're not fine. You're over here eating a, somebody else's tuna sandwich. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually I really wanted to come over and see Kylie. She's been really distant with me lately. I tried to get her out and go paddleboarding, wouldn't come. I texted her a couple times, she hasn't texted me back. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Aw. Kylie's just being a teenager. She-she doesn't text anybody back, she doesn't especially want to be around us, she wants to be around her friends. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you worry about that. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I want to be around Kylie. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I know you do. But you can't take it personally. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I do take it personally. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's upsetting when she's not around that much. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce feels frustrated because the girls don't spend enough time with him. Kendall's never at home. She's been finding her way in the modeling world. And Kylie is always out with her friends. And I think the fact that Bruce and I are co-parenting but not living together makes it even more difficult for him to see them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just feel bad because I don't want Bruce to get lonely. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I'm heading for the golf course. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, have fun. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Wish me luck hitting them straight. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, hit them straight. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you, I knew you would. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, don't forget to eat dinner! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you're like Puff the Magic Dragon. &gt;&gt; KIM: North yawns like that, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my goodness. &gt;&gt; KIM: She goes... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She growls? &gt;&gt; KIM: She was so cute yesterday. I put her on Kanye and she went like this. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, she didn't. &gt;&gt; KIM: She was just sit-- laying on him like that. We were laughing so hard. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That is so cute. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, I've never seen him laugh so hard. And then she peed all over him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I was like, "Oh, my gosh!" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Does he freak out if she, like, pees? Or does he not care? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, he was just like, "She's peeing." &gt;&gt; KYLIE: My dad just texted me. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Saying what? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: He's pissed that he showed up at the house and I'm not there. He has to tell me before he does... he does things like that. It's not my fault. &gt;&gt; KIM: You're never home, though. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah, but if he told me, like, "Hey, I'm coming over to see you," I would be there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've got to, um, reply to him, though. &gt;&gt; KIM: I feel like you have to make an effort, though, to go to Malibu. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Most kids, like, split time between their parents, and you don't. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kendall and Kylie are having a difficult time balancing spending time with my mom, spending time with Bruce, spending time with us, like... it is a lot. And when your parents live under one roof, it obviously makes everything so much easier, but now things are different. Is it true that Bruce is doing or no? &gt;&gt; KIM: Doubt it, but then again, he would... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It said online he was doing it. &gt;&gt; KIM: It also said online that I'm, like,a donkey. So, like, I wouldn't believe anything online. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I thought you were a donkey. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I thought you were, too. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, a donkey-man. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Uh-oh. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, honey... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: That goes on the left-hand side. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh. There's nothing in here, so I don't know where anything goes. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I'm just actually a little bit worried about you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: And so I went out and just got a few things so that if you get hungry... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Please. I'm not... I'm not... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...and you're not at the club, you'll have something to eat. You gotta have something to eat, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I got plenty of food. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I got a little worried for Bruce when I saw him earlier, so I thought it would be a good idea to bring him some groceries and take a look around and see what's really going on over here. It kind of smells in here. I feel like you haven't taken your trash out in forever. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, I take it out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It doesn't smell like it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I already had some apples and oranges. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, now you have some more. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It's a bachelor pad. There's only one person here. A-And... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't forget to wash these. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah, I know, okay. Honestly, I'm doing just fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Don't you get lonely out here by yourself? You're somebody who can get very into yourself and very, um... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What do you mean, into myself? &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...secluded. You tend to be a hermit. You have to get out and invite people over. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I try to get the kids over. They won't come over. This is exactly the reason why I'm not living under the same roof as Kris. I don't need her telling me what to do at all. I'm just fine here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: If you're not interacting with your family members, you're gonna be isolated out here by yourself. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: But I am interacting. Just... stop. I get it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You should be having... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Just stop. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Co-parenting isn't easy. I just want to make sure that Bruce stays engaged and part of our life, so if he's not gonna take care of himself, then I'm gonna take matters into my own hands. We thought that you could join us to do yoga today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I mean, it's great to see Kylie, but at a yoga class? &gt;&gt; EVA: This is your movement, and where you are is where you are. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: "Where you are is where you are." Got it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did our painting come yet? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, you have been tracking it, oh, very closely. Not me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look. There's a package right there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Obviously, that's from... You can tell the painting is not in there. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yes? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, just driving to the club. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I have a... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because I have a fantastic idea that's even better than driving to the club. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's that? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I'm with Miss Kylie and we thought that you could join us to, um, do yoga today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yoga? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, yoga. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, because I thought it would be really fun to do it as a family and, you know, a lot of golfers do yoga for strength training. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Hopefully, it just doesn't take very long. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It doesn't take that long. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'm in, I'm out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: See you there. I'll text you the address. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Okay. Bye. &gt;&gt; KRIS: He wants to go home before he even gets started. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, no one wants to do yoga right now. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't think Kylie realizes how much Bruce needs our love and support right now. When I first met Bruce, I thought it was really kind of odd that he lived out in Malibu, really in this remote place by himself and seemed extremely lonely. So no matter what it takes, I'm gonna make sure that he doesn't go to that place again. You guys have to get on my bandwagon sometimes. It gets so annoying. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How amazing is the smell of the orange blossoms? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. Out there. Whatever kind of meeting you took in here, somebody was reeking. Do you smell it in here? Smells like a potpourri bag gone wrong. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Are you joking? Take a whiff! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did our painting come yet? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Dude, you have been tracking it, oh, very closely. Not me. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, you see the deliveries here and have time to get them. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't watch the deliveryman! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look, there's a package right there. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Obviously, that's from... You can tell the painting is not in there. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It said it was getting delivered today and I just went through all the packages... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So track it. You are excited about it. I'm not. I'm still on the fence. I don't think it's real, you do. You track your package. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's an original Modigliani. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You're an original psycho. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: There's none others of it online. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: In my mind, I can't imagine this painting being real and just sitting around. It doesn't make sense. If it was valuable, my Jewish father would have sold that at the block that he could find. And he would've been driving around in ten Rolls-Royces. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: All right. Well, you can continue to be super casual about this, because we are sitting on a fortune. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You are crazy. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just fun. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Can you get some potpourri in here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KRIS: Have you ever done yoga before? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Like, once. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. Come on out here. Look at how beautiful this is. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think it's down here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: This is so pretty. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's do this... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...'cause I want to, uh, get to the golf course. &gt;&gt; EVA: Welcome. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, everybody. &gt;&gt; ALL: Hi. &gt;&gt; EVA: I'm Eva. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Bruce. &gt;&gt; EVA: I'm gonna... I'm gonna ask you, no socks, please. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, I gotta leave 'em on. &gt;&gt; EVA: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, I'm Kris. &gt;&gt; EVA: Hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Socks are good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi. &gt;&gt; EVA: Welcome; I'm Eva. All right. We're gonna start by tuning in and just relaxing for just a moment. Inhale in, reaching up nice and tall... and on that exhale, we're gonna swan dive forward. Let the belly drop forward. Beautiful. Now let's reach one more time. Exhaling... All right. Bending the knees, let's find your balance. Where'd you go? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: My knees don't bend that far. &gt;&gt; EVA: All right. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; EVA: We'll step out of this in a moment. Come back to the... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Two knee surgeries. &gt;&gt; EVA: Keep the hands on the mat. We're gonna walk back. Beautiful. All right... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I didn't train for the Games this way. I'll do, like, hurdler's exercises or something while you do this. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Seriously, Bruce? You are being so disruptive. &gt;&gt; EVA: Now, as we take that heel, we're gonna bring it in. That's wonderful, good job. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Considering, yeah. Yes. Little surgeries going on here. Look at those babies. There... there... &gt;&gt; EVA: Take a moment to reach back into the heels. This is your movement, and where you are is where you are. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: "Where you are is where you are." Got it. Oh, that's profound. But where I'm at is out of here. Honey? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hmm? &gt;&gt; EVA: ...in the fingertips... &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? You're disrupting the class. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love it, but I've got a tee time in, like, 20 minutes right over there. I mean, it's great to see Kylie, but, you know, at a yoga class? Um... where we can't even talk. This is not my idea of being close to my daughter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't just leave in front of the entire class. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm meeting the guys. Keep going. Don't let me stop you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce is ditching yoga and Kylie and I for golf. In the past, Bruce didn't have a real close relationship with his boys, so I want to do everything in my power to make sure that Bruce doesn't go to a place where he drifts away from Kendall and Kylie. I'm not gonna give up. &gt;&gt; CICI: I just think this is fabulous. It's a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Coming through with some... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God! There goes $10 million! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where's Kylie? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie left. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why did she leave? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's 16 and she's cranky. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please, don't give me this, stop making excuses for her. &gt;&gt; CICI: Hey! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, Ceece. &gt;&gt; CICI: Kourtney, these are cute. I'm a little bit worried about the shoes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is very stylish. &gt;&gt; CICI: You think Birkenstocks are? I'm not a Birkenstock person. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're a little wide on your feet. &gt;&gt; WOMAN: Kourt, for you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, it's the Modigliani. &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, my God! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This painting is the torture of our lives. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Should I...? &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, my God, where are we gonna retire on this? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hold on, I got to get rid of this boy. &gt;&gt; MASON: No! &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, my God. It's fab... Oh, I love it. Do you know what? There's some imperfections, which is okay. I just think this is fabulous. It's a masterpiece. It's a masterpiece. We're rich! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You guys are totally appraisers. There's imperfections on the border. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, our Modigliani arrives. Thank God CiCi's at the house because she is just as excited as I am. And Scott's just acting like the neighbor painted this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Look, I hope you're right. I'm praying you are, but... &gt;&gt; CICI: Yeah, aren't we all? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...I just don't think it's gonna be what you think. But it's worth the dream. I just, I can't handle the letdown when they say it's not. I feel like if we pretend it's real, it's real in our eyes. And we can have friends over for cocktail parties and they can all think we're art enthusiasts, but if it turns out fake, we got nothing. All we got is a dream. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm gonna go hide it. Coming through with some... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, my God! There goes $10 million. &gt;&gt; CICI: Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's why I need to hide it. &gt;&gt; CICI: Put it under the bed. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's go fill out our waiver. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Okay. &gt;&gt; MAN: How you all doing? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Good. &gt;&gt; MAN: How many climbers do we have? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Three climbers. &gt;&gt; MAN: Wonderful. &gt;&gt; KRIS: These little rock climbers. The yoga thing didn't seem to work out. So I'm gonna see if maybe rock climbing is the thing that's gonna pull everybody together. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: This is a lot more fun than a yoga class. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, guess what. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: We have to have a little chat. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, you know the dress that I've been looking for for four days? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I found it in your closet. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Oh, my God, I'm so happy for you. What do you want me to say? &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can't take my things anymore. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Mom, you're really pissing me off, and I'm gonna leave in five minutes if you don't stop talking to me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's why I have a camera that I put in my closet now, so I can just roll back the tape. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Good, good! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm literally so happy for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Are you sure? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Guys, guys, guys, we came here to have a little fun. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And we're discussing all this stuff, let's go. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't think I'm gonna climb. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; ANASTASIA: You okay? &gt;&gt; MAN: So, ladies, ready for some magic shoes? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I don't think I'm gonna stay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Why? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Because I'm really sensitive to anything that puts me in a bad mood. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I drove all the way here to do this. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Do you want me to cry and rock-climb? &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, of course not. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: So I'm gonna go, but you can stay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's really nice. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's the final one? &gt;&gt; MAN: Address. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, the address. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Stas? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I was so excited to at least get together and spend some family time. Then it just falls apart. Who knew that me bringing up my clothes would start World War III? But I'm gonna hang in there. &gt;&gt; MAN: Let me introduce you to your instructor. I got to go find him, see where he's at. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, where's Kylie? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kylie left. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why did she leave? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She said she's sensitive. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What the hell's that have to do with climbing a rock? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I don't know. Kylie is working it out. She just was having an emotional day today. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please. I came all the way over here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's 16 and she's cranky... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, please, don't give me this, don't make excuses for her. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just trying to keep the peace with everybody. I try so hard to make everybody happy. Kylie's just a teenager. Sometimes they storm off. And Bruce never seems to understand that she's 16. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Seems like every time I turn around and want to do something, everybody, like, gone! &gt;&gt; KRIS: There's a lot of different personalities. And there's a lot of different dynamics. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, don't give me this, all this personalities... &gt;&gt; KRIS: She's just having a bad day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Personality is BS. I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Doesn't this look real to you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What am I looking for? I think this painting is, like, hideous. I mean, I'm sure... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, don't touch it! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You have a tendency to be very kind of controlling. I don't need that in my life. &gt;&gt; MASON: This is called sword fight hands. Yeah, I'm gonna win! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ow! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. Will you come? I need to show you something. You're gonna freak out. Scott is being such a Debbie Downer. At least I have Khloe here, so Khloe can help me convince Scott that we really need to get this appraised. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ♫ Dun-da-na-na. ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is that? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's the Modigliani. It's, like, the lost, missing Modigliani. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourt, you wish. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: 'Cause when you look it up online, this doesn't come up. Let me just show it to you up close, okay? Look. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. I mean, I'm sure... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, don't touch it! I'm saying just look at it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What am I looking for? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you looking for when you look that close? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm just telling you. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't know why you think it's real. You've never, like, examined art before. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I really don't know anything about art. But when I see Kourtney getting excited, I cannot help but get excited with her even though I think this painting is, like, hideous. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That kind of looks like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney, let's, I think let's get it appraised. What's the worst that could happen? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't think we should get it appraised. Because if it's fake, we're all gonna be very devastated. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, if it's fake, I'm cracking it over my knee and basura. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ah, I've always wanted to do that. I don't want anyone coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's, I can't take it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I just want to dream that it's real. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott is so worried that what if it's not real. It's just gonna be a disappointment. But, like, it could be this life-changing piece of art that's, like, buried treasure in the pirate ship. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: And what are you doing? No, no, no, no, no, I want you to stay with me. I want you to stay with me, P. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kylie, you look so cute. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Thank you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Huh? &gt;&gt; KIM: Let me see your hair? I noticed it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do I get the Kim K. seal? &gt;&gt; KIM: Uh, not yet. It's like all stripey, all that should be dark. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: We're going to the wellness kitchen? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I'm hitting the men's room. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'll be right back. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Before he comes back, I just want to tell you, I want to have this cooking class so he can learn how to cook some things for himself. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm just worried about him. Today I have a backup plan. Instead of inviting one child, I'm inviting the whole family. So that if somebody storms off, I have extras to take over. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, you look like such a lady today. &gt;&gt; KIM: Really? I was trying to be a whore. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why are we having a, like a sit-down dinner? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Because guess what. It's a cooking class. You're gonna love it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: A cooking class? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, this is why I had all these girls, so I didn't have to cook. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello. &gt;&gt; PAULETTE: Hi, everybody. My name is Paulette Lambert and I am your chef this afternoon. And I'm also your nutritionist. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, good. &gt;&gt; PAULETTE: So, yeah. So everybody ready to cook? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I should probably be on the golf course, but... let's cook. &gt;&gt; PAULETTE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. We're ready; we came ready. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Let's do this. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Whoa, look at this. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've been wanting to do this for so long. &gt;&gt; PAULETTE: Kind of think about what you'd like to do and we'll get started. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'll make the soup. Um... Bruce, do you want to make a fish? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I can do the fish. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'll make the spinach. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Is this the baking dish? &gt;&gt; CHEF: That is the baking dish. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Kim, you're looking very domestic. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am getting married. I gotta figure it out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; PAULETTE: You can just kind of pile it in and start fluffing it over when it starts to wilt a little bit. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Take it out? &gt;&gt; PAULETTE: Take it out, put it all in here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You know what you're doing, Bruce? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It says there's... oh, preheat the oven. So I... we had to preheat the oven. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I think the oven's preheated. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And the grill. I can... &gt;&gt; KRIS: And then we're gonna dip each piece of bok choy... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I got it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...in the marinade. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right, I got it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Place on the grill... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I got it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is that enough, um, marinade in there? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KRIS: For the bok choy? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honey, I got it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, just checking. &gt;&gt; PAULETTE: You want to put a pot holder underneath that for me? Looks beautiful. Dinner is ready. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KIM: Fancy. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Let's open up a restaurant, guys. We're so good at this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Your fish is good, Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: It is good, isn't it? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I'm really proud of us, guys. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Me, too. &gt;&gt; KIM: You guys... who made the cod? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Bruce. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What is it? &gt;&gt; KIM: A hair, and that is, like, your type of hair. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I made a fish, but I think we made a different one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Bruce, maybe if you'd cut your hair, this wouldn't have happened. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Uh, awkward. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right, let's go. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, that was good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I would have to say one of the reasons why I enjoy living out in Malibu and being apart is because you have a tendency to be very, kind of, controlling. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: And I just want you to know that I don't need that in my life. I'm just fine on my own. And I kind of see what you're doing here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What am I doing here? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You're-you're worried about me, but, honestly, I'm fine. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Of course I'm worried about you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: When'd we meet-- when I was 40 years old? For the first 40 years I did a lot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm a caretaker. I want to take care of him, and I always will. But sometimes my intentions come across maybe a little too strong, especially now that Bruce and I aren't living together, so it just might be better to let him fend for himself. Well, you're a good sport for showing up, so thank you for that. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What... Aren't you a little dressed up? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I know. I need to change. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I mean, you look cute, I just don't know where she's going. Where's Mom going? &gt;&gt; MASON: I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Me neither. She looks pretty, though. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I'm tired. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay, I'm tired. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like we should just tell this guy not to come. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He's already on his way, he's coming from Beverly Hills. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It doesn't matter. Cars know how to turn around. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: He left at 6:00, it's 6:50, he should be here any minute. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's just say forget it and take him off the gate list. &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay, I'm tired. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Okay, I'm tired. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I booked an appraiser to come to the house because I don't care if Scott doesn't want to know; I have to know if this painting is real or not-- I can't take it. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: H-Hello, hi. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How are you? I'm Kourtney. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I'm good, I'm David. Nice to meet you, it's a pleasure. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice to meet you. This is Mason. &gt;&gt; DAVID: How are you, Mason? &gt;&gt; MASON: Good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Show him your works of art on the wall. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Oh, my gosh, I love those-- these are beautiful. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes, so we have this painting. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is the one. For you, is it just, like, a glance, or, and you know? Or do you feel like...? &gt;&gt; DAVID: I mean, yeah, I could pretty much... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I can pretty much tell. It's a great piece. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So this is it, Kourt. Your time's up. I think this is when your dream is about to be crushed. You're about to find out your so-called masterpiece is not such a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Honestly, every time I ask somebody to do something with me, nobody shows up. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So we have this painting. &gt;&gt; DAVID: Yes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For you, is it just like a glance and you know? Or do you feel like...? &gt;&gt; DAVID: I mean, yeah, I can pretty much... I can pretty much tell you. It's the real thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Get out of town. Are you serious? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Yeah, I am. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I think it is. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have got to be kidding. &gt;&gt; DAVID: I think it is. It fits everything. You know, he did this kind of muddled, strange background and he did it over the faces. What I look at are the brush strokes, subject matter, signature. All three are dead-on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How do you check for sure? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Any of the auction people can do the tests on it. It's worth your while to send it off, have it researched. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: The appraiser thinks the painting is real. Like, I am in such shock-- this has to be a joke. Like, even though I thought that it was real, I just can't believe that it could possibly be the real thing. &gt;&gt; DAVID: It's a great piece. any other Modiglianis? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Fake and real? &gt;&gt; DAVID: Yes, I've seen both. We may be fooled, but if it is, it's a darn good... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; DAVID: ...fake. I mean, you know, I don't think it is. I think it's the real thing. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: In the beginning, I had no excitement about this piece of art, because I thought there'd be no way it could be real. But now, with this appraiser saying there's a possibility, this is getting me a little tingly. I mean, if it is, we're sitting on a gold mine over here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thank you. &gt;&gt; DAVID: It's wonderful, thanks again. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Thanks for coming out. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Nice to meet you guys. Take care. &gt;&gt; DAVID: It's a pleasure. Thank you, thank you. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Bye. So what do we do? We could call Tomer and ask him to send a Sotheby's person. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Tell Tomer to come over to look at the painting. Where is he? But could we...? Okay, this thing's real, let's-let's just chill out. &gt;&gt; TOMER: Hey. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, are you home? &gt;&gt; TOMER: No, I just left. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh, I was gonna say this appraiser guy just told us-- and I'm not kidding-- that he thought our Modigliani was real. &gt;&gt; TOMER: You'relying to me! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We're... want to sell the house. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Would we want... no. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: We want to move up. &gt;&gt; TOMER: You need to send it to Sotheby's. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, so what do we do? Should we take a photo? &gt;&gt; TOMER: Yeah, let me e-mail them today and see exactly what they need. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, bye. &gt;&gt; TOMER: Okay. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Hey, whoa, whoa, watch the cat. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Put it back in our secret hiding spot. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No, this is going back to the safe department. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: You look so cute today. Wait, stay there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: No, you're... I need to. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Why do you guys have to take pictures of yourself all the time? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause we're so... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Vain. Speaking of pictures-- Kendall. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, what about Kendall? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What's your opinion on the runway pictures? I don't know if that's good or bad for the modeling career or what. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hello, she's all over right now. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Good. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I'm proud of her. But... she's been gone way too long. But anyway, what did you think of the cooking class? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I liked it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: You know, once it was over with, I talked to Mom. You know, I just said, I could see what she's trying to do. Mom's kind of been... well, I can't say kind of strange lately, she's always been kind of... controlling. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm very controlling, too, so I get it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. I think a lot of that is, I allowed her to be so controlling over the years. Especially with me and everybody else, and... on and on and on. It's like she's feeling sorry for me that I can't take care of myself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't think it's coming from a malicious place. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I think it's just her way of controlling everything. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: And what, it just bothers you? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Well, I just don't... Yeah, I don't... I just don't need it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My Mom is Ms. Fix-It, and she feels really bad that Bruce is living by himself and that Bruce feels lonely and she has good intentions, but I definitely think sometimes she goes a little too far. I'm sure, for a man, that you probably feel like, hello? I know how to take care of myself, I've done it for 40 years or how old were you when you met her? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Yeah. It's nice that she invited me to the cooking class. I think that's nice of her. It's just that, honestly, every time I ask somebody to do something with me, nobody shows up. So it kind of gets frustrating that nobody ever comes to my side and does something that I like to do. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Aw. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Aw. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I didn't even realize how much it hurts my dad when Kendall and I don't see him. I feel really bad, so I'm definitely gonna make more of an effort to hang out with him. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: I try to get these guys to come out paddleboarding, and I can't even get 'em to do that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, don't you remember being 16? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, bugle? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Come over here, please. I need your help. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is this? You're not picking out carpets for the house. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't pick out carpet for houses. Only for aviation and yachts. I need to start thinking about what kind of color carpeting I want on my jet. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So now you're into this... suddenly? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I've always been into being ultra-rich, but I just never believed it was gonna happen the way it's supposedly gonna happen. But, look, I'm gonna jump on the bandwagon. I want to be excited with you. Of course, Kourtney and I started researching what some of these paintings have gone for recently in auctions, and a couple went in the 40-to-80- million-dollar range, so, if that's true, we'll be out jetting around town. We'll all probably be broke after a little bit of spending, but, yeah, it's fun. This is really not aircraft or aviation-grade carpeting. I'd probably do a Pinta Fanina interior. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You need to chill out because we don't even know if the painting's real. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I feel like if I put my energy in thinking it's gonna happen, maybe it will. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, well, then, let's see what happens. Scott is planning every dollar and how he's gonna spend it. Like, we really don't know if this painting's real. I know that I was so excited, but now that he's starting to get carried away, it's just making me freak out a little bit. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: So, are we thinking black? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not entertaining this. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: All right. Fly on. I'll be flying without you. The moment you've all been waiting for. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is our... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The Modigliani results. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you hoping it's real so you can leave me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's it say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It says... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Dad? Oh, no. Oh! Dad? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, thanks. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I brought you a sandwich with your name on it. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh. You brought me a sandwich? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Oh, that's nice. No, it was actually pretty good out there today. Went down there. There were some other people down there, but what... Little paddle surfing. You know, Kris has kind of been babying me, but ever since that cooking class, she has been easing up tremendously on the whole controlling thing, which has given Kylie and me the space to naturally find ways to spend time together. This is about Kylie and I keeping our relationship and our communications open, because family is the most important thing out there. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: What are you doing tonight? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Tonight? &gt;&gt; KYLIE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Actually, uh, there's a fund-raiser, uh, Brody's going to. He just texted me, so I'm gonna go shower, clean up and go over there... &gt;&gt; KYLIE: All right, well... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: ...with Brody. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: ...hit me up after if you're still awake. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: All right. And thanks for the sandwich, thanks for coming out. &gt;&gt; KYLIE: I love you. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Love you. &gt;&gt; HASKINS: Hi. I'm Scott Haskins. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nice to meet you. So excited. Do you want, like, a flat surface? &gt;&gt; HASKINS: Yeah, do you have a table where we can look at it? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. It's really sunk in that we may have this extremely rare and valuable painting. My mom has set up for this expert to come out and look at our painting, and I just really want a definite answer before Scott loses his mind and orders a G-6 on his credit card. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: What do you specialize in exactly? &gt;&gt; HASKINS: Well, I'm an art conservator. Uh, I'm looking for anything that proves that it's not. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Got it. &gt;&gt; HASKINS: It's a... I'm looking for red flags. I've had multiple run-ins with Modigliani. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I already made plans with the money. We're feeding children... &gt;&gt; HASKINS: Oh, great. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...that cannot afford to eat. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: How much dough were you planning to spend on the charity stuff? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I don't know. We'd have to see. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Uh, two percent maybe? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Five percent? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ten percent? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know what? I don't know. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Ugh. I just need money for this helicopter. &gt;&gt; HASKINS: Saving up for a helicopter? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; HASKINS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: There goes a hundred grand. &gt;&gt; HASKINS: No pressure, huh? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you see any red flags? &gt;&gt; HASKINS: I, um... I just have some interesting things that I can't answer. Yeah, I thought I was coming to look at an oil painting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh. &gt;&gt; HASKINS: And, uh, this is obviously watercolor on paper. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; HASKINS: Another thing that's interesting... This is on cardboard. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I thought it was just, he could tell us a "yes" or "no," but one person tells us it could be real, one person tells us maybe it's not real. I guess it's not that simple. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, you're gonna go back to the lab and analyze that stuff? &gt;&gt; HASKINS: Oh, absolutely. I'm hoping I can get it back within a week? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hey, guys. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I love them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Look what we have here. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The moment you've all been waiting for. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is our... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The Modigliani results. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait. These are the test results from the painting? You're just opening this for the first time? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. It was sealed. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is just to confirm if the paint is authentic, though, right? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Well, that's the next step. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you hoping it's real so you can leave me? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Ugh! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, right, guess where it is. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For once, the tables are turned. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's it say? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It says, "The analysis shows that both the painting and the board on which it was painted contained titanium dioxide, aka titanium white." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That wasn't... It was never around. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "It would appear impossible that he could have painted this." &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, no. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "Amedeo Modigliani..." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why did you try to get me all riled up? I knew we had nothing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "...died years before the artist's pigment..." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let's burn this thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "...was available in France. For whatever reason..." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It's over. It's over. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: The dream is over. The nightmare begins now. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "It is an older copy-- 1930s, 40s-- which gives it some historical value..." &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, suck me dry. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: "...and possibly some minimal financial value, though the faded condition probably limits that..." &gt;&gt; KRIS: That was exciting for a minute, though. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're not millionaires. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: It gave us something to live for. Well, I guess I won't be getting that private jet after all. You know, you win some, you lose some. But, on the upside, I don't have to worry about getting a hangar and a pilot and a staff for it. At least it's over, and we can move on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. I don't want to keep wondering... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I couldn't sleep at night. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's such an amazing piece of art. It's really cool. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I don't want that thing staring at me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: How much is the original worth, I wonder? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Too much. Like a lot. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, how much would have been worth if it was the real deal? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Like crazy money. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Couple hundred million. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right? Sweet. You bought a van? Keeping Up with the Kardashians... What goes on here? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Just a little bit of work. I have this mobile office. I'm sure I could find some use for it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna get the cheesy mac. Mmm! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This is the way to go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Maybe you should take care of your own dog. &gt;&gt; KENDALL: I would do it happily, but you don't even give me the chance. Mom is being so annoying. She, like, won't stop complaining about... &gt;&gt; KIM: I would be annoyed, too. You're never home. It's not fair. You should be thankful of her.
