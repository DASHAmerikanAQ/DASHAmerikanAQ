- ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: What'd you do? &gt;&gt; MASON: Um, I colored. &gt;&gt; KIM: You did? &gt;&gt; MASON: And I read books. &gt;&gt; KIM: Have you been good and Star Wars bed? &gt;&gt; MASON: Um, sometimes I do. Do you want to see what toys I can get when I sleep in my bed? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; MASON: You... they're gonna be so cool. &gt;&gt; KIM: So why don't you do it? &gt;&gt; MASON: Okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Did you see the pics online of Khloe? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. With her, like, posse? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, who are these friends? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: Her, like, Instagrams of her... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's just so shady all the time. &gt;&gt; KIM: She's so shady. Like, have you even met this French guy? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Nope. Have you? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. He's just so not, like, her type. I thought she literally only liked black guys. This is, like, the first non-black guy she's ever been with. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I've heard of the name French Montana, heard that he's a rapper and Kim said he's from Morocco. I'm just not exactly sure who he is, and since him and Khloe have been spending time together, we need to find out ASAP. I mean, it's the same as she was before Lamar. She just, like, does her thing and she doesn't tell anyone. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, true. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's just her. She's kind of, like, a ride-or- die kind of... beeyotch. &gt;&gt; KIM: You can't even talk to her about anything, 'cause she's so sensitive. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I saw another thing before, where she was in New York. &gt;&gt; KIM: Shadeballs. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; SCOTT: He's doing the hangman! He's doing the hangman! Oh, yeah! &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KIM: My, um, pants. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Your butt hanging out? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, it's like full butt cheek hanging out. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Oh! Hi, you! &gt;&gt; KIM: Guess I still have baby weight to lose. Well, this is the wedding location. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. Really cool, right? Mase, look. This is where my wedding is. The wedding is approaching, so the pressure's really on. It does get kind of stressful, just 'cause everyone has so many requests, especially when it's a destination wedding. There's so many other logistics that go along with it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What's this little stack? &gt;&gt; KIM: This is invitations. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wait, is this the wedding? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yes. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you like the colors? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Why don't you just e-mail people? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, I do like the color. But, like, this... we were just thinking of, like, the texture. I really like this one. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I kind of like the size of that. I like things that are oversized and dramatic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I would think Kanye would want to pick all these things out himself. &gt;&gt; KIM: He does. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: That's for damn sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: So I need to wait. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, i-is that typical, though, that the groom...? &gt;&gt; KIM: And... so I'm not gonna give my opinion. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Is anything typical? I mean, who cares at this point? &gt;&gt; KIM: So, the wedding ceremony. So we're gonna tell everyone to be outside and vans will pick everyone up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But don't you want everybody to see where we are and how gorgeous the grounds are? Or wherever we are doing this secret service? We have to make this decision, like, pronto. &gt;&gt; KIM: Um, you've never even had a convo with my wedding planner, so how would you know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I haven't had a conversation with her because you've never included me. I know that Kim and Kanye want to do this whole thing by themselves, but I think any mom is so thrilled when her daughter or her son gets married, so I do want to be a part of the wedding planning, just a little bit. &gt;&gt; KIM: So the night before, we're gonna drive through the gates of Versailles, and we've rented out Versailles. But don't tell anyone that part. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I appreciate you leaving it super low-end, so there's nothing for us to have to reach if we ever do anything. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, can't I help with something? What if I... did a party for you in Paris? &gt;&gt; KIM: We just don't have time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you want my input? &gt;&gt; KIM: Not really, 'cause I need to see what he wants, so we'll go over it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Good. Well, maybe when Penelope gets married, she'll want my input. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, relax. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I had so much fun hosting the show tonight. I want to thank Chelsea for having me on. Kim just e-mailed me. I said I was shaking with nerves. My mom is such a flake. She said she was coming. Okay, well... &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Are you okay? You should be so excited, you did so good. Are you not happy? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Khloe, you were hilarious. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; JOYCE: Hi! &gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Like, people were roaring the entire time. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was guest-hosting today, and my mom/manager, um, is supposed to be here and she's late. So frustrating. I was so nervous. I'm so happy it's over, 'cause I was so nervous. &gt;&gt; JENNIFER: You... honestly, you could not tell at all that you were nervous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay, good. &gt;&gt; JENNIFER: At all. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop it, tell me more. No, I'm just kidding. Where theis she? I'm gonna kill my mom. Recently, my mom has been very overwhelmed, I think, in handling all of her responsibilities. I've been asking that we are equally taken care of. That hasn't happened. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you like that book deal idea? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: For who? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Me. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Somebody called today about Kourtney and a book. A lifestyle book. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: People want to hear what I have to say, Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm stepping away from her before I literally eat her. I am so incredibly happy that my mom is trying to get Kourtney a book deal. She deserves it and she wants it. But I don't even feel like I have gotten ten percent of what I should get out of my mother or my manager. psycho! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KIM: Is this your room? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You've never been here? &gt;&gt; KIM: Not in your room. Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, you guys are here. &gt;&gt; KIM: You look really pretty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What are you guys doing here? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What are you doing here, is the question. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Nothing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We saw pics of you in At-- Hotlanta. &gt;&gt; KIM: ATL, Shawty. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't been to Atlanta in three to five years. &gt;&gt; KIM: When Kourtney and I talk to Khloe, we have to tread really lightly, because Khloe gets so defensive. We just want to know, who does she hang out with? What makes, you know, KoKo happy? But she's been really resistant. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I gotta change my phone number. &gt;&gt; KIM: Why? Who is this crew you've been hanging out with? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who have you been hanging out with? &gt;&gt; KIM: The W crew. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The W crew? The West crew? &gt;&gt; KIM: Westside... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I have no idea. I like to hold some things private until I know what's happening. And I'm still going through a divorce. I don't feel like I have to let everybody in on every little thing I do if I don't even know what I'm doing in my own life. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: They're up to no good. &gt;&gt; KIM: I just want you to have fun, but be protected. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, this has been a great talk. I'm so happy you guys came here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You little freak. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Hi, lovely. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Cute. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You look really pretty. This hair... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Thanks. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Like, real, my weave is so tight, so I'm like, I can't wear it down. So I told you to pay me no mind. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You look beautiful. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: Thank you. Oh, what's this? Vision board. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I want to make my mind up about the floors, like, ASAP. Oh, Mom! Nice seeing you here. I have a million questions for you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you gonna do about this fireplace? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes. If you were not 30 minutes late, we could talk about it. So let's... let's talk. This fireplace we are getting rid of. And then in the kitchen, we were gonna change the hardware, too. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Do you know that I'd actually die for that red chandelier? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I like it a little more subtle. Like, this is what I've always wanted, is... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Awesome. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: She's making this process so much longer, too. Like, I have to get through this whole house. We're only onto the second room. And she was supposed to be in my Chelsea... didn't show up. She just doesn't make me a priority whatsoever. All I've asked was for an hour of my mom's undivided attention. She's finally here-- she's late again. Like, I really need her to pay attention. I'm making really expensive decisions about my home. I don't just want her here on the phone. Mom... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I love you, but this was supposed to be my time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Got it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: We're redoing all the fountains, Mom. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, fun. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom. Mom! She is irking theout of me. I'm going to kill her. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: You'd like something a little more graphic? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah. I do with drapes. Well, I mean, I would have to see, I mean... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Another shopping day. I have to go, Khloe. I have to change and go to a meeting. I love these floors. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Did you proofread the questions? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't see the questions, so shoot me! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom was begging and begging me to do this radio interview. I'm gonna get someone new to run my'cause you're not honest! &gt;&gt; KIM: We're gonna stake Khloe and French Montana out in the parking lot. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wait, I think this is her car. Yes, she does! &gt;&gt; KIM:But that's Lamar! What theis going on? &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, I feel like I've lost, like, one pound. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: I feel like you've lost at least three. &gt;&gt; KIM: What?! All right, so what else do we need to go through? Lights... &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: Lights. &gt;&gt; KIM: ...for Paris. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: We need to make sure your whole family is booked because... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, let me go talk to my mom and see what she's booked. Mom? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hi, honey. &gt;&gt; KIM: I wanted to see... Are Kendall and Kylie's flights booked for Paris? I have a checklist of things, and that is one of them. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Um, yeah, I booked them. I mean, I get no information from you, so I just went ahead and did my thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: I gave you dates. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim... &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, what information do you need? The time? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, you're having a wedding. I don't know anything that's going on. Uh, you don't even let me give you, uh, a wedding shower. &gt;&gt; KIM: We don't have time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All I wanted to do was a small little party with some of your... &gt;&gt; KIM: I don't even want a party. We've had so many parties in my life, I don't have time. I just have to get through the summer. I need to get through the wedding, Kanye's birthday party, North's first birthday party, moving into the house. Like, everything is moving so fast... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah, you've got a lot going on, but that doesn't mean I couldn't have given you a little party to celebrate... &gt;&gt; KIM: When did we have time? When do we have time? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. I don't know. &gt;&gt; KIM: If you're dying for a party that badly, you can have, like, a dinner. You know, with just my friends. Like, five, ten people. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I would love to do that, that's what I've been begging you to do. &gt;&gt; KIM: Fine, fine, but no party. Dinner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, we go out to eat. We need to eat. I'm honestly exhausted from having to, like, fend my mom off. I'll throw her a bone and I'll let her throw, like, a bridal shower. Nothing, like, really directly related to the wedding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, I promise if you let me do that for you... &gt;&gt; KIM: Dinner, just a dinner. &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...it will be really small. &gt;&gt; KIM: Perfect. Bye. Don't have time. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Who wants to set the table? It's Mother's Day. Scott, so, did you take the soap out and then just decide to put it back right there? Just making sure because... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Oh, yeah, you don't live here, do you? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott, seriously, don't make me shove aso far up your ass. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Whosewould you be using? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mine. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Let me see that little thing you got. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: The one Kourtney loaned me. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I was wondering where her penis went. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh, it smells good in here. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hey, Mama Bear. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, everybody. Khloe, what are you making? This is amazing. You know what I would do with this-- maybe the gold silverware that we have? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: And some white flowers? &gt;&gt; KENDALL: Okay. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kendall leaves for a month on Thursday. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: For where? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: New York, London, Paris and back. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: What is she doing? &gt;&gt; SCOTT: You name it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Modeling, modeling, cover, cover, shooting a cover, shooting a fashion show... &gt;&gt; KRIS: ...presenting at the Billboard Awards. I'm so proud of her. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: What is going on? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom does not protect me ever, and it's so frustrating. As your daughter and friend, you've let me down and now as your client. Mom, listen. This New Zealand radio thing-- did you proofread the questions? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I haven't seen the questions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, that's up cause they're printed out by my bed. The first question is "What do you think you know about love? And if you were to be married again, would you just elope?" &gt;&gt; KRIS: Just say no to all the questions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, Mom... It's your job as my manager! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm seeing this... No, it's a P... No, I'm not PR. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, no... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, calm down. This is the first I'm seeing of these questions. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's not the first time I've... One day, Mom, I'm going to... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who is it coming from? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm gonna get someone new to run my And I tell you this all the time and you never change. So, no, I'm not doing your interview tomorrow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Who is it come...? Then don't do it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Shut up! &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're asking me for the Instagrams and the interviews that we all do and I gave you one and I didn't see the questions, so shoot me! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This came through you! &gt;&gt; KRIS: I didn't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You authorized it! Work, Mom! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you were dating somebody, would you tell me? &gt;&gt; KIM: I got an e-mail from the wedding planner. "Your mom wants to do favors for the night before the wedding." My mom can't go against mine and Kanye's wishes. I'm going to move out. I'm gonna move in with Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, just stop! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No questions about my husband, my marriage. The first question-- "What do you think you know about love? "And if you were to marry again, would you elope?" Very first question. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, obviously those two are off the table. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: They should've never been written because that was my one thing! I'll talk about anything but that! &gt;&gt; KRIS: For an interview... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My mom and my manager should have my back! Be my second set of eyes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't want to talk to my mom like that, but it just infuriates me. She'll, like, get a deal together and then the follow- through's not there. I just feel like I'm not protected by her. This radio thing? It was just the straw that broke the camel's back. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: Don't get yourself too upset, though, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, the one thing I said was about my marriage. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I get it. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's the first sentence... &gt;&gt; SCOTT: People are scumbags out there. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: ...and you don't throw in anything? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Khloe, we've already said no to those three questions and said no relationship questions whatsoever. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I don't feel comfortable anymore. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: No big deal, move on. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay, so we'll cancel. Khloe! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mom, just stop talking to me, please! I'm asking you nicely right now, just stop. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Dinner ready? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh, hi. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Looking good, Khlo. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Well, happy Mother's Day. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Where are we eating at? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Some of Khloe's comments, you know, were definitely not the nicest comments, but she's going through so much that she has to deal with. So I totally understand why Khloe would be upset. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just don't understand what I can do to make Khloe happy. What is it that I'm doing so wrong that when she asks me to do something and deliver, I deliver, but it's not, it's still not good enough? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think that she just wants a little extra special attention. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I think it's, like, a sensitive subject with Lamar, and, you know, I think it's just time you have to make a decision to stop some of the things going on in your life. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm not sure what's eating at Khloe, but she's completely attacking me for something that isn't even my job. I don't understand where all this anger is coming from. I want her to feel like all of the rest of you guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, on a whole other side note-- I thought I had a bad shopping addiction. The amounts of clothes that get delivered every single day... &gt;&gt; KRIS: My clothes. &gt;&gt; KIM: No, it's so bad. &gt;&gt; RUSHKA BERGMAN: You know, guys, let's go, let's go! That's it, that's it! Let's do this! That's the girl-- ha! &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm doing this photo shoot today for HYPE energy drink and it's a crazy shoot with six different looks, really different time periods. And one really cool look is an Audrey Hepburn-inspired look. &gt;&gt; RUSHKA BERGMAN: Much faster. She's going to the dream. That's it, that's it, that's it! She's beautiful. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: This is the guest list. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: That you need to go over. &gt;&gt; KIM: Ugh, I have to call my mom. I just don't get it. Where did she even get all this information from? &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: What did she...? What do you mean? What information? &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, all of our wedding vendors, you know? &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: Her and Kat e-mailed me saying that you asked her to a-ask me for the information. &gt;&gt; KIM: No. My mom has gone behind my back, called the wedding planner, and this just isn't fair. Like, this is our wedding and we want it our way, not her way. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: It's Kris, sure. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, she's a pathological liar. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE: She just conned me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Conned you. Full con artist. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hey, Khlo. You look gorgeous. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Not my day today. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Me either. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I definitely want to apologize to my mom, because... as angry as I was at her, my delivery wasn't appropriate, it is not okay, and it's still my mom, and I know she means well, but my frustration sometimes gets the best of me. I am sorry for how I spoke to you-- I'm not sorry for addressing what I addressed, because I just don't feel like you take me seriously sometimes. It's one thing after another, after another, after another... &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, it's not one thing after another. We work our asses off and I think we're doing... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I never said... I'm not... I never said you don't work your ass off. Just with everything that's, like, been happening within the last few months or a year or whatever, like, I just feel like, well, first, like, you're my manager, but second, you're my mom, so I should be able to trust you... first and foremost. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: but I don't want to feel like I have to even, like, be on... like, my guard with you. I want to feel, like, protected by you. And not exploited by anyone. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, I don't want you to worry like I'm ever gonna be on anybody else's side but yours. Khloe's feeling vulnerable and unprotected and attacked. And... I understand that. But, because I didn't take that into consideration, she felt like I wasn't watching over her like a mother hen should. You're always protected by me, Khloe. When everything gets crazy and life gets nuts, I'm gonna be here to support you; that's what family's all about. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: And open up a little shelf space... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Excuse me, how do you say this word? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I can't read it, "plasma"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Put on your glasses that are in front of you, Sherlock! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh... right. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Aplomb." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That means, "Complete and confident composure or self-assurance; poise; keeping the class engaged and focused..." &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are you trying to get a bigger vocabulary? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom, I heard you got in a huge fight with Kim. She said you were trying to meddle into the wedding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You were? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I wasn't trying to meddle into the wedding. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That's a pretty color on you! &gt;&gt; KIM: What was that? Oh, thank you. We were gonna make your dresses like this... and long cream. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's pretty. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait, were you guys discussing our argument earlier? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I was. &gt;&gt; KRIS: She brought it up, I never said a word. &gt;&gt; KIM: All I said was, I got an e-mail from the wedding planner and Sharon said, "Hey, Kim, I just want you to know your mom wants to do favors for the night before the wedding. What should I do?" &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Kim has made it so clear she doesn't want any help with the wedding. &gt;&gt; KIM: You have your signature style, and Kanye and I really, really, really want this wedding to be just about me and him. Just a-- 100% us together. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I get it... Okay... &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, I've said it to you five times like that. My mom really has to learn that she just can't go against mine and Kanye's wishes. We have everything planned a certain way and she just needs to butt out and go with the flow. I just want to take every responsibility off your plate. I don't even want to have a-a bridal shower. &gt;&gt; KRIS: So, now you're taking the shower away from me?! &gt;&gt; KIM: I can't even deal. I'm gonna move out. I'm gonna move in with Kourtney. Do you have an empty room? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, just stop it! Don't be so dramatic. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, I'm serious. I think it's time I have a change of scenery. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Well, this certainly backfired. Everything is a complete mess. And everything is my fault and no good deed goes unpunished. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I can't have her for too long. But I will have you. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're being dramatic right now. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not being dramatic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You're being dramatic. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not being dramatic. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's... Kim, don't do, don't... That's being mean now. &gt;&gt; KIM: Living here is so overwhelming. I just can't even deal with this every day. I just have to get out of here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Have you met Khloe's new, like, crew of friends? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kourtney is so nosy. Stop. Stop talking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: How do you feel about going to Mom's tonight for dinner? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so not in the mood. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She already told me she doesn't think she should come to the wedding. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It must be fun to dress another person, like, a little, cute, little... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It's way more fun than dressing yourself. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: 'Cause little kids don't have body issues. And no one judges them. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, I'm getting her Paris vibe. Do you think this is cute or not really? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's very lesbian chic. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you think Rob is gonna come to the wedding? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, he says he is, obviously, but I really don't know. Like, he also is in this new thing where he hates me being at the house, which was fine because I was in Vegas all weekend. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I see you always gallivanting around to all these trips that Kim and I aren't invited on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You wouldn't pick up for the weekend and leave your kids. You don't have help on the weekends. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I'm not saying I want to go. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh! Diss. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: So, who was with you this weekend? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: A bunch of my friends. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Diddy, Quincy, Justin Bieber... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah, so far so good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: ...French Montana. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Do you even know half the people you're naming? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: No. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Good. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: If you were seriously dating somebody... would you tell me? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My sisters are just so nosy. And then on top of that, my family is-- shocker-- very judgmental. Nobody has time for that right now. I don't think I would tell you guys a lot of anything 'cause you guys are shady people. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: We're shady? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Because we want to know what you're doing? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, 'cause you guys just, like, criticize every little thing. Just that you guys want to know so badly what I do in my spare time makes me think there's a bigger purpose. I am just a girl who likes to go out on the weekends. Maybe to a different state. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Go get your groove on. 'Cause it's now or never, baby. Khloe likes to keep things as secretive as possible. She's never been really open about any of her relationships, especially when it's something new. So, I know something is going on. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: P, come here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: P, come in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I have a hug? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yeah! What? You want your blanket? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Okay, close your eyes. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She wants you to come lay... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You want me? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Okay. Oh, yeah! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mase, where are you going? Are you dressed to go somewhere? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yes, because I'm going to Malibu. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You know you have soccer in the morning. You like this shirt? &gt;&gt; MASON: Uh, okay. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KIM: Kourt? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Where are you? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Right here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey, Mase, I'm moving in. You want to take me to my room? &gt;&gt; MASON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: Come on, P. Kourt, watch North, okay? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes. &gt;&gt; MASON: Kanye can sleep there. And North can sleep there with you. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, and then that one will be empty just in case one of us wants the bed. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hello. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kourtney? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This is Kourtney. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Is Kim there? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Like, this is overly dramatic and stupid. Why are you even playing along with it? She can't just leave here. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay, you're... This conversation's already too long-- bye. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm gonna go unpack my bags. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You have got to be kidding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I will not put up with these shenanigans. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Mom! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Stop, you... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She's here. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Put Kim on the phone. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Do you want to talk to Mom? &gt;&gt; KIM: I think my mom has to learn boundaries. I've really explained this to my mom over and over again and she just doesn't really hear me. At some point, I have to put my foot down. Yes, Mother dear? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, this isn't a game. So stop playing games with me. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, but realistically I'm gonna have to move out in a few months anyway. &gt;&gt; KRIS: First of all, you're disrupting everything. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, Mother. She's like... Why does she even care? &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, if this is her... &gt;&gt; KRIS: Hello. &gt;&gt; KIM: Mom, you're so annoying. Bye! All right, so I'm gonna go stay in, in... Okay, Scott's room? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, I'll show you your room. &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Daddy! &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God! Don't answer. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Don't answer. Just don't answer it. &gt;&gt; KIM: Don't answer. She's crazy. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Okay. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Hi, Khadijah! I didn't know you were already here. Who wants to go first? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will! ♫ ♫ What? I hate this stupid thing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah, it's a different kind of thing. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: There wasn't very much effort behind that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Khadijah's like a real bowler, though. That's what sucks. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Ooh! It's a spare, people! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Good job! &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Yeah! Are you drinking, Khlo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: You have to get these margaritas out of... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Khloe's still drunk from last night. She didn't go to bed. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I haven't been to bed yet. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: You haven't? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I know, huh? &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: I want to be Khloe when I grow up, Kourt. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, you're just so little! &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Like, my balls are just going... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I got on a plane at 5:30 a.m. Well, this party... I think half the people there were butt naked. You would've loved it. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Um, have you met Khloe's new, like, crew of friends? &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: No. Well... kind of. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: You did? &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop. Stop talking. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just said, "Have you met Khloe's new crew of friends?" &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: And all I said was, "Yes." And then I stopped. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop talking. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: All I said was, "Yes." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean... Kourtney is so nosy. I don't know, I just feel like how she's approaching this situation makes me so defensive. &gt;&gt; KHADIJAH: Not bad. That was good! ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Look at those teeth. Can you say "North"? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Da-da? &gt;&gt; KIM: Da-da? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KIM: What about "North"? &gt;&gt; PENELOPE: Nor. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: That was good, P. &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so tired, but we have this meeting. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Yeah. We have to go change in a minute, but do... how do you feel about going to Mom's tonight for dinner? &gt;&gt; KIM: I am so not in the mood. The last time I was there, I just had such a headache. Like, so much is going on. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: She already called me and told me she doesn't think she should come to the wedding. I totally understand why Kim is upset, but I think that my mom and Kim just need to figure it out and move on, because this is ridiculous. I mean, you've been staying here for two days. You guys haven't spoken in two days. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's fine. Two days. We can have a break. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I just think we need to squash this fight. Okay, I'm gonna go change, but you really need to talk to her tonight, and go to dinner. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Chebanballs! &gt;&gt; KRIS: When did you get in? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why are you so tan? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yesterday. Am I? You know that Miami. 90 degrees. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Trouble. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: By the way, where's Kim? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She moved out. She got... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What do you mean, she moved out? &gt;&gt; KRIS: She got mad at me and so she moved in with Kourtney. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're kidding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: No, she is getting very dramatic... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: What else is new? Everybody in this family is dramatic. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's going on with you? I see you all over town. &gt;&gt; KHLOE:nothing. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I'm in New York and I have to see Khloe all day. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Hi, guys. &gt;&gt; KIM: Jonathan! What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, my God. &gt;&gt; KRIS: What are you doing here, Kim? &gt;&gt; KIM: I didn't even know you were in town. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Well, I was gonna surprise you, but I heard you moved out. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: So, did you just come for the sushi? &gt;&gt; KIM: I came to apologize. That got your attention. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You did? Yeah, it did. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sorry I was so dramatic. I really want you to come to my wedding. I think you're being dramatic. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What? &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Of course she's coming. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You disinvited her from the wedding? &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Disinvited who? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. Mom said she didn't want to come to the wedding. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Of course I want to come to the wedding. &gt;&gt; KIM: But this is just... I've said it a million times; we just want it to be our taste. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But then tell me that you want me to be surprised and how exciting it's gonna be. Don't say, "Mom, butt out, it has your smell all over it." &gt;&gt; KIM: I've told you so many times. I didn't say that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This isn't a time to fight again. &gt;&gt; KIM: You live a double life. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How do I live a double life? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just weird that you have these friends. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not a double life! &gt;&gt; KIM: What theis going on? I'm freaking out of my mind. Like, all of a sudden he shows up. What is he gonna do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so bad. &gt;&gt; KIM: I've said it a million times. We just want it to be our taste. &gt;&gt; KRIS: But then tell me that you want me to be surprised and how exciting it's gonna be. Don't say, "Mom, butt out, it has your smell all over it." &gt;&gt; KIM: I've told you so many times. I didn't say that. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: This isn't a time to fight again. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Kim, I think what you don't realize-- and maybe you will when North is going through the same thing... &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Are we still talking about this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I just didn't like the feeling of being shut out. &gt;&gt; KIM: And I'm really not trying to shut you out. I just want everyone to enjoy themselves, have a good time, not feel like they have to work... just go with the flow for once. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I want to go with the flow, I do. And I realize that maybe I just need to lighten up... &gt;&gt; BRUCE: No, you don't. You've never gone with the flow. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm gonna try to go with the flow. You guys are gonna be so proud of me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I know my mom's heart is in the right place and she has a big heart and she loves to help. Hopefully, there'll be no more drama from here on out. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right. Give me a hug. &gt;&gt; BRUCE: Look at them hugging and making up. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's really about you. It's not about me. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm sorry for moving out. But you missed my presence? You know? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I did miss your presence. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That sounds sincere. Take it and run. &gt;&gt; KRIS: "Take it and run." &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Oh, Scott, your whole ass is out! &gt;&gt; BRUCE: How cute is that? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Scott! &gt;&gt; SCOTT: I'm finally a Kardashian. ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; KIM: Wish I could take a pill in a liquid. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Some of it's, like, tangy. Tastes weird. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hey. Are you gonna keep this tattoo? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: My "L.O." tattoo? &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What am I supposed to do with it? &gt;&gt; KIM: Get it removed? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: But I don't want to remove it. I like tattoos on my hands. But I could change the words. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, you could add a "V.E." What is this necklace that you've got? Don't you have one that said "Karim"? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Yes, I did. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, why are you lying... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Can I finish my story? &gt;&gt; KIM: No. I just want to know why are you lying to me about this supposed boyfriend? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I will talk to you... What? Stop. That's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; KIM: Khloe, seriously. I feel like... you have two, like, lives that you live. It's kind of annoying that I have to find out all this information on the Internet instead of straight from Khloe. I think, if anything, my sisters are the first people I tell all my business to, so it's kind of weird that Khloe can be so secretive. Like, seriously, you live a double life. Like, you go away at night... ...and you have like a whole new secret... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What's my double life? I go to work at day... &gt;&gt; KIM: And then at night, I see... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm with my friends. &gt;&gt; KIM: But who are your friends? I see you Instagram or I see photos, paparazzi photos of you and, like, a whole crew heading on a plane, and I'm like, "Where is she going?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Heading on a plane where? &gt;&gt; KIM: You're like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: When have I ever Instagramed heading on a plane? &gt;&gt; KIM: "Fun night," like in Arizona, and then I'm like, "What? Who is this person?" &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That was a month ago, when I went to a strip club. &gt;&gt; KIM: But I'm just saying, like... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I'm not the girl... like, friends that I know... &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm just... I'm not allowed to ask who they are? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You're making fun of me, and that's what's not funny. &gt;&gt; KIM: I'm not making fun of you, I'm saying you... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I live... how do I live a double life? &gt;&gt; KIM: Just saying... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I was at home 24/7 when I was married. A double life is what I did, constantly hiding what someone else was really doing. That's a double life. &gt;&gt; KIM: It's just weird that you have these friends. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: That's not a double life! Lamar's here. I don't know why Lamar would choose to be here. &gt;&gt; KIM: He is at the front, okay. What do you want me to do? ♫ ♫ &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: I haven't done a hideout like this-- this is unbelievable-- in a long time. I don't know... &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, why don't you back in and park there, so we can view the cars driving in the parking lot. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: All right, let's sneak in here. &gt;&gt; KIM: So you know Khloe has no idea that we're going here. Like, French has no idea. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What's he gonna say? What if he goes buck-wild? &gt;&gt; KIM: Are they... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What kind of car does he roll in? Does he have his own, or does he rent one? &gt;&gt; KIM: I have no... I don't know her crew. I have no idea. Khloe and French Montana and their group of friends were hosting a party in L.A. We see it on Instagram, this flyer going around. We see pictures of him and Khloe out all the time. We always ask her about him, and she's always really, like... laughs it off, doesn't say much. So, we're gonna stake them out in the parking lot. We're gonna see what's going on. And make her finally just say this is, like, a new guy that she's dating. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Uh-oh, we got, we got, we got a Range Rover. Who's that? Oh,! &gt;&gt; KIM: We are so lucky that my daughter is a good sleeper and sleeping, 'cause these things are just not appealing to me. Like, who would, who would willingly want to come to the club? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Khloe has turn... She's, like, a whole new person. &gt;&gt; KIM: Yeah, like, she is Khlo Money in full effect. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: She is a movie, man. &gt;&gt; KIM: Oh, my God, is this her friend? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, this guy? &gt;&gt; KIM: Red leather pants, bucket hat. Bucket hats are coming back. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: And they disturb me. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: It's a mix because he's wearing Justin Bieber pants and he's wearing LL Cool J's hat. So, basically he's a mess. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: I need to take a nap. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: What kind of stakeout partner...? &gt;&gt; KIM: It's literally 12:15. God, can't you have a seat warmer? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: You're getting cranky, you're getting tired. Don't blame me that Khloe goes out to clubs in L.A. at 12:30. &gt;&gt; KIM: My daughter wakes up at 7:00 and I have to work out before then, so I'm just saying my life... I'm half Kourtney these days. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Don't go full. If you go three-quarter Kourtney, you lost me. You know I'm not good with that. &gt;&gt; KIM: It'll be fine. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Some stakeout. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, wait-- I think this is her car. Yo, get up! There's her, there's her car. &gt;&gt; KIM:That's Lamar! That is Lamar! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Oh, That is Lamar. &gt;&gt; KIM: Wait... oh, my God! &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't call him! Don't call him! What are you doing? &gt;&gt; KIM: What theis going on? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yes, she does! &gt;&gt; KIM:That's Lamar! , that is Lamar! What theis going on? I'm freaking out of my mind. Like, Lamar had to have known that they were gonna be here. It was, like, a publicized thing and then all of a sudden he shows up. What is he gonna do? Wait. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Get out of the car. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hold on. Guys! You guys! &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What theare you...? &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Sorry, we need to talk to you. &gt;&gt; KIM: I came to spy on you, but I really need to talk to you. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Like right now. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just saw him. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Yeah, it's really awkward. &gt;&gt; FRENCH MONTANA: Wow. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hi. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Kim, what the is going on? My heart is beating so crazily fast and I can't really breathe and I feel claustrophobic and I'm in this car and I don't know if I should get out of the car. There's all this paparazzi. I don't know why Lamar is here. This is a French Montana party. That's very clear. That's how this place is promoted. My sister Kim is here, who never goes out or never does anything. The-the whole thing is awkward. &gt;&gt; KIM: I mean, I don't know. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: What is happening? &gt;&gt; KIM: I, by the way, we literally... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We were sleeping in the car. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Why were you guys here though? I don't understand. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We just came to see who you were hanging out with, it's nothing crazy. &gt;&gt; KIM: We have been, I just... &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Lamar's here. You didn't just see him? &gt;&gt; MALIKA: No, I did not. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: You guys, I can't be here. This is reallyup. &gt;&gt; MALIKA: I would know if I saw him. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Stop yelling! I don't want this to be a loud thing. I got to get out of here. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, well, isn't it his party? &gt;&gt; FRENCH: Yeah, it's my thing. &gt;&gt; KIM: So, you guys, so... what do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: It's weird and it's not making sense. I don't know what's going on. And French keeps asking, "Does Lamar want to say something to me? Does he want to talk to me? 'Cause why else would he be here?" What are the chances that he comes up right when we're... &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: Well, the chances are that he was waiting for you because he knew probably he was hosting the party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: This is so bad. I can't handle this. &gt;&gt; KIM: Okay, well, be calm. Do you want us to go in? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I can't go. I'm not going to start right now. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: He can't be standing outside still. It's been 15 minutes. &gt;&gt; MAN: Khloe, you staying? &gt;&gt; MAN 2: He's at the front. &gt;&gt; KIM: He's at the front. Okay, well, I don't want to make... &gt;&gt; ERROL: I'm not gonna let him, I'm not gonna let him in. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: No, but that's like humiliating to not let him in. I don't want to embarrass him. &gt;&gt; KIM: Well, you don't, you guys don't want to create a scene. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I just feel horrible. I don't even know what's happening. I don't know why Lamar would choose to be here. But I said of course, let him in. Don't you dare not let him into the place. It's not a, like, I'm not a spiteful person. I don't care. I'm not gonna ban you from a club-- that's pretty petty in my opinion. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: That was the craziest thing that could've ever happened. &gt;&gt; KIM: The club didn't let Lamar in because they didn't want there to be any drama. And I understand why they wouldn't want that, but Khloe feels bad and it's like she has to stop feeling that way, she has to stop thinking this way. &gt;&gt; ZOE: Hi, how are you? &gt;&gt; KIM: The famous Zoe. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We finally meet the friends. &gt;&gt; KIM: We finally meet her friend Zoe. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN: We only see everybody on Instagram. &gt;&gt; FRENCH: That was crazy. I thought you set it up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I would never do that. I don't even have his number. He would never even show up. &gt;&gt; FRENCH: Nobody could've put that together. &gt;&gt; KIM: Like, that was the craziest thing because I was sleeping, like, waiting for you guys and then I was like, "Oh, my God, wait, that's... what?!" Is this the crew? Is this the crew? It is so obvious that Khloe and French are dating. They are so cute and he is so sweet with her. All of his friends are so nice. They're so welcoming. And it's good to finally meet them all. I get why she's hesitant on introducing anyone to the family, but if she's out and about all over the world with this guy, there's no reason she shouldn't share it with her family. He left. &gt;&gt; FRENCH: I would never do no like that. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: Like what? Show up? &gt;&gt; FRENCH: Yeah, show up to another man's party. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I changed my number and now he's showing up. &gt;&gt; KIM: I can see that it's really uncomfortable for Khloe. She can't stop talking about this run-in and I understand it. If it was just me and her or her and all of her girlfriends, let's talk about it for hours. But because French is here, it must be ten times more uncomfortable for him. I feel like don't act like it affects you too much, you know? &gt;&gt; KHLOE: How am I not to? &gt;&gt; KIM: No, I'm just saying, like, I feel bad for French, you know? I'm glad you're safe and your crew is amazing. &gt;&gt; KHLOE: I mean, everything happens for a reason. It's just so ironic that the one time Kim is surprising me at a club or even going to a club, this craziness happens with Lamar and I and, um, it happened in the way it was supposed to because Kim was there to... I don't know what I would've done if Kim wasn't there. It's really difficult to leave one relationship and go to another one and kind of find your way. ♫ ♫ I'm a different person. I'm gonna deal with things differently. And that's in every situation. I'm still gonna hold things closer to my heart and maybe still keep things private for me, but it's good that I'm slowly letting them in. &gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: French Montana! Keeping Up with the Kardashians... The wedding is weeks away. The pressure, it's so, so tough. Brody is like, "How dare she extend the invitation to Brandon, but not to me?" To be totally honest with you, I'm at my snapping point to where I will go theoff on him. And I'm not playing. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: I wanted to tell you I am pregnant. &gt;&gt; SCOTT: This ain't good. &gt;&gt; KIM: Hello. &gt;&gt; KOURTNEY: Scott never came home last night. &gt;&gt; KIM: That's insane.
